Agreement, (e) the terms "day" and "days" mean and refer to calendar day(s),
(f) the terms "year" and "years" mean and refer to calendar year(s), (g) all
references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" will mean U.S. Dollars, (h)
the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if",
(i) the use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly
indicated otherwise and will mean "and/or" and (j) the word "will" will mean
"shall" and vice versa. Unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement,

successors and assigns are permitted by the terms of any applicable
agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular capacity excludes such
Person in any other capacity or individually. For the avoidance of doubt, any

addition of the absolute value of such negative number or amount. This
Agreement will not be construed as if prepared by one of the Parties, but
rather according to its fair meaning as a whole, as if all Parties had
prepared it. Where the term "made available", "provided" or other similar

and for the avoidance of double counting, to the extent an item is included
under either the definition of Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses such item
shall not also be included in the other definition or in the calculation of
Net Working Capital, and no item included in the calculation of Net Working
Capital shall be included in the definition of either Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the
matter set forth on _Schedule 1.1(g)_, the uncapitalized term "material
adverse effect" is intended to have a different meaning than the capitalized
term "Material Adverse Effect" defined in _Section 1.1_.

conditions of the Letter of Transmittal were specifically negotiated by Parent
as an inducement for it to enter into this Agreement and such terms and
conditions are an integral part of the terms of this Agreement. Upon surrender
to the Company of a Certificate for cancellation, together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount (if any) to be paid in respect of each share
of Company Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate in accordance with
_Section 3.2_ and _Section 3.9(e)_, without interest, and such Certificate
will then be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.7_, each Certificate (other than certificates representing Dissenting
Shares or other shares of Company Stock cancelled pursuant to _Section
3.5(b)_) will be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, if any, to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this _Article
III_, without interest.

(b) _No Further Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article
III_ will be deemed to have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the securities represented by such Certificates and
there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, except as provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If a Stockholder's Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Stockholder may submit in lieu thereof, an
affidavit of loss or destruction containing an indemnity against claims that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, but without the necessity of posting a bond or any other payments
related thereto, and the Stockholder Representative will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof in accordance with this _Article III_.

  



  

(d) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any former stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ or the
Letter of Transmittal will thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Stock as such stockholder held prior to the Effective Time as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Stockholder Representative or any other Person will be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any portion of the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with this _Article III_ that remains
undistributed to any former holder of Company Stock, as of immediately prior
to the date on which the Merger Consideration that would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, will, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, automatically become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

Section 3.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Share will not be converted
into the right to receive the amount of cash as provided in _Section 3.2 _or
any other amounts contemplated by this Agreement, if any, but will instead be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Share pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such
shares will receive payment therefor in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (but only after the value therefor will have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL). If, after the Effective
Time, any Dissenting Share will lose its status as a Dissenting Share, then
any such share will immediately be converted into the right to receive the
amount of cash as provided in _Section 3.2 _and any other amounts
contemplated by _Section 3.9(e)_, if any, without interest, as if such share
never had been a Dissenting Share, and Parent will deliver, or cause to be
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the
holder thereof, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set
forth in _Section 3.7_, the amount of cash as provided in _Section 3.2_ and
_Section 3.9(e)_, if any, without interest, as if such share had never been a
Dissenting Share. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (b) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company will not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or
offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
claim or demand with respect to any Dissenting Share. Upon resolution of the
amount due a holder or holders of a Dissenting Share, Parent will pay such
holder or holders the resolved value of such Dissenting Share.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) No later than 90 days following the Closing Date, Parent will
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the "
_Preliminary Adjustment Schedule_ "), which sets forth Parent's calculation
of (i) the Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary Net Working Capital_ "),
(ii) the Net Working Capital Surplus, if any (the " _Preliminary Net
Working Capital Surplus_ "), or the Net Working Capital Deficit, if any (the
" _Preliminary Net Working Capital Deficit_ "), (iii) Closing Date Cash (the
" _Preliminary Closing Date Cash_ "), (iv) Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Preliminary Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (v) Transaction Expenses (the "
_Preliminary Transaction Expenses_ "), and (vi) the Adjustment Amount
calculated based on the information contained in the Preliminary Adjustment
Schedule.

  



  

(b) The Stockholder Representative will have 60 days following
receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule during which to notify
Parent of any dispute of any item contained in the Preliminary Adjustment
Schedule, which notice will set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute. If the Stockholder Representative does not notify Parent of any such
dispute within such 60 day period, the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule will
be deemed to be the Final Adjustment Schedule. If the Stockholder
Representative notifies Parent of any such dispute within such 60 day period,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative will cooperate in good faith
to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such
resolution, the Final Adjustment Schedule will be prepared in accordance with
the agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative and its representatives shall be given such access to the
financial books and records and appropriate employees, accountants and
advisers of the Company Group as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request to the extent reasonably necessary to confirm Parent's
calculation set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule.

  



  

   

 | -32-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to
resolve any dispute regarding the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule within 30
days (or such longer period as Parent and the Stockholder Representative will
mutually agree in writing), following notice of such dispute, such dispute
will be submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute will be
resolved by the dispute resolution group of FTI Consulting, or in the event
that FTI Consulting is unable or unwilling to take such assignment, the
dispute resolution group of an internationally recognized accounting or
financial consulting firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (FTI Consulting or the accounting firm so selected, the "
_Arbitrator_ "). Such resolution will be final and binding on the Parties.
Parent and the Stockholder Representative will instruct the Arbitrator
to make a final determination of Net Working Capital, the Net Working Capital
Deficit, if any, or the Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, the Closing Date
Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses and the
Adjustment Amount based solely on the items that are in dispute and that, in
resolving such items in dispute and in determining Net Working Capital, the
Net Working Capital Deficit, if any, or the Net Working Capital Surplus, if
any, the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Transaction
Expenses and the Adjustment Amount, the Arbitrator will not assign to any item
in dispute a value that is (i) greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative, on the
other hand, or (ii) less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand. The Arbitrator will make its determination based solely on the
information presented to it by the Parties and will not undertake an
independent review. The Arbitrator will use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete its work within 30 days following its engagement. The fees and
disbursements of or related to the Arbitrator will be borne by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Arbitrator's determination bears to the aggregate amount of all of the items
in dispute as submitted to the Arbitrator by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. For example, should the items in dispute total $1,000 and the
Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of the Stockholder's Representative's
position, 60% of the fees and disbursements of its review would be borne by
Parent and 40% of the fees and disbursements would be borne by the
Stockholder Representative. If any disputes are submitted to the Arbitrator
pursuant to this _Section 3.9(c)_, the Final Adjustment Schedule will be
prepared in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator and, to the extent
applicable, the agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Representative.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Within five Business Days following the determination of the
Final Adjustment Schedule in accordance with this _Section 3.9_:

  



  

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive, then (A) Parent will pay,
or cause to be paid, an amount equal to such excess (such amount, the "
_Upward Adjustment_") in accordance with _Section 3.9(e)_ ( _provided_ ,
that any portion of the Upward Adjustment that would have been paid in
respect of a Dissenting Share in accordance with _Section 3.9(e)_ if such
share did not constitute a Dissenting Share will instead be retained by Parent
and the Upward Adjustment payable pursuant to _Section 3.9(e)_ will be
reduced by the corresponding amount), and (B) Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing it to release the Adjustment Escrow Fund in
accordance with _Section 3.9(e)_. Upon payment of such Upward Adjustment,
Parent will be fully released and discharged of any obligation with respect
to payment of the Adjustment Amount; and

  



  

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative (such amount, the "
_Downward Adjustment_ "), then Parent and the Stockholder Representative will
promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to effectuate
disbursement of the Downward Adjustment to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow
Fund and thereafter, with respect to any amounts in excess of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, of the lesser of (A) the amount
of the Downward Adjustment that exceeds the amount of the Adjustment Escrow
Fund and (B) the then-remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If any
amount remains in the Adjustment Escrow Fund after the distribution of the
Downward Adjustment to Parent, Parent and the Stockholder Representative will
promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
effectuate disbursement of the remaining amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund
in accordance with _Section 3.9(e)_.

  



  

(e) Payment of the Upward Adjustment, if any, or release from the
Adjustment Escrow Fund for the benefit of the Stockholders, In-the-
Money Option Holders, Phantom Equity Participants and Change of Control Bonus
Recipients, if any, pursuant to _Section 3.9(d)_ will be paid to the
Stockholders, In-the-Money Option Holders, Phantom Equity Participants and
Change of Control Bonus Recipients in the percentages set forth under the
caption "Percent of Proceeds from Escrow Account and Stockholder
Representative Expense Release" on the Closing Date Payments Exhibit.

  



  

(f) Except for any payment to an In-the-Money Option Holder, a
Phantom Equity Participant or a Change of Control Bonus Recipient that
will be distributed by the Company through the Company's payroll pursuant to
_Section 3.9(e)_, all payments required under this _Section 3.9_ will be
made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
accounts as will be designated in writing by the recipients or, in the case
of payments to Stockholders, by the Stockholder Representative.

  



  

(g) Any payment that is to be made pursuant to _Section 3.9(e)_ to
an Equity Holder, which is attributable to an Option will, to the extent
required by applicable Law, be treated for Tax purposes as a payment, when and
if made, of compensation for services and, accordingly, Parent will reduce,
or will cause the Company to reduce, each such payment by the amount of any
required federal, foreign, provincial, state, or local withholding Taxes
payable by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to such payment.
Parent will pay or will cause the Company or such Subsidiary to pay such
withholding Taxes to the applicable Governmental Entities as required by Law.

Section 3.10 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each member of the Company Group, the Stockholder
Representative, Parent (including its Affiliates and Representatives) and the
Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith to minimize
any withholding tax, and Parent will notify the Stockholder Representative
two Business Days prior to the Closing of any withholding in respect of the
Closing Date Payment.

Parent, any ERISA Affiliate, has within the prior six years maintained or been
required to contribute to any benefit plan subject to Title IV or Section 412

 | -47-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan, including any associated trust or
fund, has been administered in compliance in all respects with its terms and
the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Laws,
except to the extent such noncompliance would not result in any material
Liability. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a current favorable determination
letter or is the subject of a favorable opinion or advisory letter from
the IRS on the form of such Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan
that is a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" under Section
501(c)(9) (a " _VEBA_ ") has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service
to be exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
Since the date of each most recent determination referred to in this _Section
4.15(c)_, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance has existed that resulted or is likely to result in
the revocation of any such determination letter or opinion letter or that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan
or the exempt status of any such trust or VEBA. No member of the Company
Group has filed within the prior three years, or is considering filing, an
application under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the
Department of Labor's Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan. No complete or partial termination of any Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has occurred within the prior three years or is expected to occur prior
to the Effective Time. No member of the Company Group has any commitment,
intention or understanding to create, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan. Except as required to maintain the tax qualified status of any Company
Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code or
required under any other Law, no provision of any Company Benefit Plan would
prevent the amendment or termination of such Company Benefit Plan. With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan which provides for the grant of options
to purchase Equity Interests of any member of the Company Group, each such
stock option has been granted at an exercise price equal to no less than the
fair market value of the stock of such member of the Company Group, as
applicable, at the date of grant and there has been no "backdating" of any
such stock options.

  



  

(d) No member of the Company Group, nor to the Knowledge of the
Company any other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has
engaged in any transaction with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that
would be reasonably likely to subject any member of the Company Group to any
Taxes or penalty (civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other
applicable Law.

  



  

(e) All contributions, assessments and premium payments required to
be made on account of each Company Benefit Plan have either been made or
accrued on the Financial Statements, and each member of the Company Group has
timely deposited all amounts withheld from employees into appropriate trusts
or accounts, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in a material
increase in the cost to the Company Group of providing benefits under the
Company Benefit Plans as compared to the most recently ended fiscal year
except for any such increases in the ordinary course of business or resulting
from market conditions. No deduction with respect to a Company Benefit Plan
has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Entity, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no condition or
circumstance has existed that could give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance. There are no existing or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Legal Proceedings relating to a Company Benefit Plan, other than
routine claims for information or benefits in the ordinary course
of business. No Company Benefit Plan or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
fiduciary thereof has been the direct subject of an audit, investigation or
examination by any Governmental Entity within the prior three years.

(f) Other than as required under Section 601 _et seq_. of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code or similar state or local law or as set forth in an
Employment Agreement that has been provided to Parent, no Company Benefit Plan
provides for post-employment or retiree health, life insurance or other
welfare benefits, and no member of the Company Group has any Liability to
provide any such benefits to any retired or former employees or active
employees following such employees' retirement or termination of service.
Each Company Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated by the applicable
member of the Company Group without any material Liability (except ordinary
course administrative Liabilities or vesting of benefits under a Company
Benefit Plan that is a retirement plan).

  



  

(g) Except as contemplated by this Agreement with respect to Equity
Interests of the Company, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions could (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, or cause the accelerated
vesting, payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of,
any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service
provider of any member of the Company Group under any Company Benefit Plan or
(ii) result in a requirement to pay any Tax "gross-up" or similar "make-
whole" payments or Liabilities to any employee, director or consultant of any
member of the Company Group.

  



  

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated and maintained in all material respects in
operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance thereunder.

  



  

(i) No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
that could reasonably be expected to subject any member of the Company Group
or any Company Benefit Plan to material penalties or excise Tax Liabilities
under Sections 4980D or 4980H or 4980I of the Code or any other provision of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148 (" _PPACA_
"), the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No.
111-152 (" _HCERA_ ") and all regulations and guidance issued thereunder as
in effect as of the date hereof, the effectiveness of which have not been
delayed.

  



  

(j) There is no Contract with any Person which provides for any
payment to any employee by any member of the Company Group, which
payment would fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
which would exceed the deduction limits under Section 404 of the Code.

when due) in any material respect with respect to any Insurance Contract, nor
has any member of the Company Group received written notice of a default or
failed to give any notice of any material claim under such Insurance Contract

to the date of this Agreement with respect to which an insurer has, in a
written notice to any member of the Company Group, questioned, denied or
disputed or otherwise reserved its rights with respect to coverage. No insurer
has threatened in writing to cancel any such policy. The Company has complied
with each of the Insurance Contracts, except where the failure to so
comply would not reasonably be expected to be have a material adverse effect
on the Company Group, taken as a whole. During the past three years, the
Insurance Contracts have been continuously in effect with no gaps in coverage.
None of the policy limits with respect to the Insurance Contracts have been
eroded in any material respect by the payment of claims pursuant thereto.

similar entities, so long as such amendments or modifications would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair the Closing or
impair the availability of the Financing), no such amendment or modification
is contemplated or the subject of current discussions, and the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.5_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent affirms, represents and
warrants that under the terms of this Agreement its obligations hereunder are
not in any way contingent or otherwise subject to (a) the consummation of the
Financing or any other financing arrangements or obtaining of any financing by
Parent or any other Person, (b) the availability of the Financing any other
financing to Parent or any other Person or (c) the funding of the
amounts contemplated to be funded pursuant to the Commitment Letters.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the accuracy of the Company's
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, (b) the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and (c)
the continuing reasonableness of the assumptions used to prepare the
Company's most-recent projections and forecasts made available to Parent and
the consummation of the Financing on terms substantially similar to those set
forth in Commitment Letters, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing or any
other financing arrangements related thereto), (i) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be able to pay their respective debts as they become
due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) and (ii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall have adequate capital to carry on their
respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation
is being incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation.

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to obtain all consents
required as described on _Schedule 4.12(b) _and all regulatory approvals and
to satisfy all conditions to its obligations under this Agreement and to cause

use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as promptly as
possible (but in no event more than ten Business Days after the date of this

the Company will (i) use reasonable best efforts to achieve Substantial
Compliance as promptly as practicable with such Second Request, (ii) certify
Substantial Compliance with such Second Request as promptly as practicable

 | -66-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Company will give all notices to third parties and use its
reasonable best efforts (in consultation with Parent) to obtain all third-
party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) required to be given or obtained, including those required
to be given or obtained on _Schedule 4.12(b)_ and the other Schedules, (iii)
required to avoid a breach of or default under any Company Contract in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions or (iv) required to
prevent a Material Adverse Effect, whether prior to, on or following the

Subsidiaries, shall, in connection with the Transactions, with respect to

the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or oral

contractual arrangements, (B) address legal privilege or confidentiality
concerns, or (C) comply with applicable Law.

  



  

(e) For the purposes of this _Section 6.8_, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, "reasonable best
efforts" includes taking any and all actions necessary to obtain the consents,
approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations of any
Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Outside
Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing, effecting and agreeing,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, to (i) sell,
license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any of the assets or
businesses of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or those of any member of the
Company Group, (ii) terminate, relinquish, or modify existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent,

would be reasonably likely to, be materially adverse to the Parent, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall require Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action

amend any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement

present employees through the Closing Date.

prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
of the Company Group (or any member thereof) for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are due to be filed after the Closing Date. To
the extent permissible under applicable Tax law, all deductions for

Period. Such Tax Returns shall be filed consistent with past practice of the
Company Group. The Stockholders Representative will prepare or cause to be

 | -68-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date_. Parent will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company Group (or any member thereof) for
Straddle Periods. For purposes of this _Section 6.10(b)_, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts, be equal to an amount calculated on a deemed closing of
the books basis for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date, _provided_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual or other periodic basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) will be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each such period. All determinations necessary to
give effect to the foregoing allocations will be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Company.

  



  

(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. Parent will provide the
Stockholder Representative with copies of any Tax Returns to be filed by
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_ and _Section 6.10(b)_ at least 30
Business Days (in the case of an income Tax Return) or 15 Business Days (in
the case of any other Tax Return) prior to the due date thereof (giving effect
to any extensions thereto). The Stockholder Representative will have the
right to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior to the filing of such
Tax Returns. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_, Parent
shall not file or cause to be filed any such Tax Return without the prior
consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Stockholder Representative
shall be considered as having given such consent unless it provides, no later
than 10 days before the due date for the filing such Tax Return, a written
notification of its objections to such Tax Return. If Parent and the
Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve in good faith any dispute
arising with respect to the reporting of any item on any such Tax Return, the
dispute shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 3.9(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
be permitted to timely file when due (taking into account all available
extensions) any Tax Return with respect to which a dispute is under
consideration, and not yet resolved, by the Arbitrator pursuant to
the preceding sentence at the time such Tax Return is due to be filed (taking
into account all available extensions).

  



  

(d) _Post-Closing Actions_. After the Closing Date, none of Parent,
the Company Group, or any Affiliate of Parent shall (i) amend or cause to be
amended any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
of the Company Group or any member of the Company Group or (ii) take any
other action that results in an increase in the amount of Indemnified Taxes or
any Taxes treated as Indebtedness under this Agreement, in each case without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
required by applicable Tax law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any amount of Taxes imposed on the Company Group or any member of the
Company Group as a result of Parent, the Company Group or any Affiliate of
Parent breaching its obligations under this _Section 6.10(d)_ shall not be
treated as Indemnified Taxes for purposes of the Agreement, including
_Section 10.1_.

  



    

 | -69-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Each member of the Company Group,
the Stockholders and Parent will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.10(e)_ and any Legal Dispute with
respect to Taxes (including any refund claims as described in _Section
6.10(f)_). Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Legal Dispute and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. Parent and each
member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the
other hand, shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company Group relating to any Taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by the other party, any extensions thereof) of
the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority and (ii) to give the other
party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, to
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Parent
and the Stockholders agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to
the Transactions.

  



  

(f) _Refunds and Other Tax Benefits_.

  



  

(i) _Refunds and Credits for Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Any Tax
refund or credit for overpayment of Tax in lieu of a refund relating to
the Company Group (A) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (B) in respect of any
other Taxes which Stockholders have paid under  _Section 10.1(c)_, in each
case, net of any costs incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
obtaining such refund or credit, shall be (without duplication) for the
account of Stockholders, except to the extent such refund or credit is
reflected as an asset in the Final Adjustment Schedule. Any other refund or
credit of Taxes relating to the Company Group shall be for the account of
Parent. Parent shall, at the reasonable request of the Stockholder
Representative and at the Stockholder Representative's expense, file for and
obtain or cause the relevant member or members of the Company Group to file
for and obtain any refunds or credits to which Stockholders are entitled
under this _Section 6.10(f)_. Parent and the Company Group shall permit
the Stockholder Representative to participate (at its own expense) in the
prosecution of any such refund claim.

(ii) _Post-Closing Tax Benefits_. Any Transaction Tax Benefits
actually realized by Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries with
respect to the short taxable year beginning the day after the Closing Date or
the immediately succeeding taxable year (the " _Specified Taxable Periods_ ")
will be for the account of Stockholders. For this purpose, a " _Transaction
Tax Benefit_ " is any reduction in the actual cash Tax Liability of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to any
Specified Taxable Period resulting from the deduction of any Transaction
Expenses (or any net operating loss attributable to the Transaction Expenses)
in such period, calculated on a "with and without" basis. At least 15 days
prior to the filing of any Tax Return for a Specified Taxable Period that
reflects any deduction for Transaction Expenses (or any net operating
loss attributable to the Transaction Expenses), Parent will provide to the
Stockholder Representative a schedule, with reasonable supporting detail,
identifying the amount of the Transaction Tax Benefit realized with respect to
such Tax Return. Parent will pay to the Stockholder Representative any
Transaction Tax Benefit within 10 Business Days after filing the relevant Tax
Return with respect to which such Transaction Tax Benefit is realized.

  



  

(g) _Tax Proceedings_. Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of any notice of deficiency, proposed
adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or
other claim (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Company Group. The failure to give such notice will not relieve
any Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Agreement except to the
extent that such failure materially prejudices such Indemnifying Party. The
Stockholders Representative shall have the right to control any such Tax
Proceeding that could reasonably be expected to give rise to an
indemnification claim by the Parent Indemnified Parties under _Section
10.1_. Parent shall have the right to participate (at its own expense with
its own counsel) in any such Tax Proceeding that the Stockholders
Representative has the right to control. The Stockholders Representative
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to such Tax Proceeding and
shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. To the extent of any conflict between this _Section
6.10(g)_ and _Section 10.3_, this _Section 6.10(g)_ shall be controlling
with respect to any Tax Proceeding.

  



  

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreement with
respect to or involving any member of the Company Group shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and have no further effect for any Taxable
year (whether the current year, a future year, or a past year).

  



  

(i) _Certain Taxes_. 50% of the transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Parent, and the remaining 50% of such
fees and expenses will be treated as Transaction Expenses. The party
responsible under applicable Law for filing any Tax Returns in respect of
Transfer Taxes shall file such Tax Returns. Stockholders shall provide Parent
with written notice (including copies of the applicable Tax Returns) of any
Transfer Taxes paid by the Stockholders, and Parent shall reimburse the
Stockholders for any Transfer Taxes paid directly by the Stockholders or any
of the Stockholders' Affiliates within five days of receipt of such written
notice.

use of such Confidential Information at any time following the date of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Termination of Agreements_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 6.12_, effective as of the Closing, the Company will terminate
and cancel, or cause to be terminated or canceled, (a) any Contract with the
Equity Holders of the Company, (b) any other management or similar Contract
entered into with any Affiliate of any Stockholder or direct or indirect
equityholder of any Stockholder and (c) all other Related Party Agreements,
in each case with no surviving Liabilities with respect to the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries following the Closing. The Company will cause all
Affiliate Loans to have been paid in full prior to or at the Closing with no
surviving Liabilities with respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
following the Closing.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the any member of the Company Group now
existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or
director of any member of the Company Group, as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the relevant member of the Company Group, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth on _Schedule
6.13(a)_, will survive the Closing Date for a period of six years after the
Closing Date and will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms.

  



  

(b) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Closing, Parent hereby agrees to, and
to cause the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation's
successors or assigns to, cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. From and after the Closing,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Company Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before
or after the Closing). Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section 6.13_, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent and the
Surviving Corporation thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation except to the extent that such failure to notify
materially prejudices such party.

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and fully pay
for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming all Persons who were
directors or officers of any member of the Company Group prior to the Closing
as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years from the
Closing Date (such "tail insurance" or the other "tail" insurance policies
obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.13(c)_, the " _D andO Tail_") from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and related coverages that are under the same policy in
an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that the cost of the annual premium for the DandO Tail shall
not be required to exceed an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company Group for such insurance;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if such amount is insufficient for such coverage, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
spend up to such amount to obtain "tail" insurance policies with the
greatest coverage available at such cost. Parent shall not, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any adverse respect. For the avoidance of doubt, the
costs of such insurance policies shall constitute Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Surviving Corporation's successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this

Company will, and will cause the other members of the Company Group to, use

through (j) will not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations
of the Company Group. Such cooperation will include (a) promptly furnishing

investment account control agreements as requested by Parent or any of the
Commitment Parties, (d) facilitating the execution and delivery of any
guaranty, pledge and security documents and other customary documentation

practicable that may be reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the
satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions to obtaining the Financing,

reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreeable times, to premises and

cause the delivery of any legal opinions or accountants' cold comfort letters
or reliance letters or any certificate as to solvency; _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company to cause the
delivery of any financial information with respect to a month or fiscal period
that has not yet ended or has ended less than 30 days prior to the date of
such request (or 90 days in the case of a fiscal year end). Parent agrees
that the execution by the Company Group of any documents in connection with
the financing for the Transactions shall be subject to the consummation of
the Transactions at the Closing and such documents will not take effect until
the Closing. Parent will promptly, upon written request by the Company,
reimburse any member of the Company Group or any of their respective
Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party costs

Agreement will forthwith become void, and there will be no Liability under
this Agreement on the part of any Party (or any Representative of such
Party); _provided_ , that the terms of _Section 6.3_, this _Article IX_ and
_Article XI _will survive any termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any party from
Liabilities incurred or suffered as a result of Intentional Fraud or a Willful
and Material Breach prior to such termination.

(e) the Closing Date Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses to the
extent not reflected in the Final Adjustment Schedule.

  



  

For purposes of determining whether any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement has been breached and for purposes of determining the
amount of any Parent Losses arising from any breach of a representation or
warranty (other than the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.7_, _Section 4.8_ and _Section 4.9(a)_), the determination will be made
without regard to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications that may be contained therein.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Indemnification Obligations of Parent_. From and
following the Closing and subject to the limitations contained in this
_Article X_ , Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder

incurred (including amounts paid in settlement, costs of investigation and

Section 10.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of
the commencement of any Legal Dispute against such Indemnified Party by a
third party (including any Governmental Entity) (such action, a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Parent Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Stockholder Indemnified Party, will, if a claim with respect
thereto is to be made against any party or Indemnity Escrow Fund, as
appropriate, obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article
X_ (the " _Indemnifying Party_"), give such Indemnifying Party or
Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, written notice of such Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to
such Indemnified Party. The failure to give such notice will not relieve any
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnity Escrow Fund from any obligation
under this Agreement except to the extent that such failure prejudices such
Party. Such Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate,
will have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party
within 20 days after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party assuming full responsibility for any Parent Losses or
Stockholder Losses (as the case may be), to defend and resolve such Third
Party Claim, at such Indemnifying Party's or Indemnity Escrow Fund's, as
appropriate, expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate. If the
Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, as appropriate, assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in such defense at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, may not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (i) which
includes criminal charges, (ii) that does not solely seek and continue to
solely seek monetary damages, (iii) that involves a customer, supplier or
employee of the Indemnified Party, (iv) if the Indemnified Party is a Parent
Indemnified Party and Parent reasonably believes potential Parent Losses
related thereto could likely exceed the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund or would cause the Parent Indemnified Parties to lose coverage
under the RandW Insurance Policy and provides notice in sufficient detail
supporting such claim, (v) if the Indemnified Party has been advised by
counsel that an actual conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim or
(vi) if the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Indemnifying
Party's assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim could adversely
affect the business operations or commercial reputation of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates (the conditions
set forth in clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the " _Litigation
Conditions_ "). In the event that the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder
Representative, as appropriate, declines or fails to assume, or is not
permitted to assume, the defense of the Legal Dispute on the terms provided
above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or
Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, in either case within such 20-day
period, or if the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, is not entitled to
assume the defense of the Legal Dispute in accordance with the Litigation
Conditions, then such Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, may employ counsel to represent or defend any such Legal
Dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that Losses will only include the fees and
disbursements of one firm of attorneys for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single Legal Dispute. In any Legal Dispute for
which indemnification is being sought under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, or Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Legal Dispute, will
have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at
such Party's own expense. If the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section
10.3(a)_, the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim (though not as
counsel of record, and subject to all privileges);  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any of the Litigation Conditions come into existence the Indemnified
Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
as appropriate, may assume its own defense. The Indemnifying Party or
Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as
appropriate, may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless such settlement involves solely the payment of money and includes a
full release of the Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative, as
appropriate, in respect of a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying
Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, has assumed the defense.
The Indemnified Party or Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, as appropriate, may not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party or Stockholder
Representative, as appropriate, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, or
Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, as the case may be, will at
all times use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party, or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, as
the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense
of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other
with respect to the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no party will be required to provide cooperation or furnish any records
or other information that would (1) jeopardize the attorney client, work
product or similar privilege of the Person in possession or control of such
records or other information or (2) contravene any confidentiality Contract,
nondisclosure Contract or similar obligation of the Person in possession
or control of such records or other information.

(b) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment
pursuant to this Agreement other than pursuant to a Third Party Claim in
accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_, such Indemnified Party will send written
notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party or Stockholder
Representative, as appropriate. Such notice will specify the basis for such
claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying
Party or Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, will not relieve
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate, from any
Liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party with respect to any
claim made pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_ except to the extent that such
failure prejudices such Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Representative on
behalf of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, as appropriate.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Claims Period_. The Claims Period under this Agreement
will begin on the date of this Agreement and terminate as follows:

  



  

(a) with respect to Parent Losses arising under _Section 10.1_, the
Claims Period will terminate on the date that is 12 months following the
Closing Date; and

  



  

(b) with respect to Stockholder Losses arising under _Section
10.2_, the Claims Period will terminate on the date that is 12
months following the Closing Date.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to 11:59 pm New York, New York time
on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party or
Stockholder Representative, as appropriate, will have been properly notified
of a claim for indemnity under this Agreement and such claim will not have
been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim will continue to
survive and will remain a basis for indemnity under this Agreement until such
claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  



    

 | -83-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 10.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to recover for any
claim under _Section 10.1(a)_ (other than with respect to any breach or
inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations) for Parent Losses
unless and until the aggregate amount of such Parent Losses exceeds Parent
Basket, in which event Parent Indemnified Parties may claim indemnification
only for Parent Losses in excess of Parent Basket. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Parent Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to
recover for any claim under _Section 10.1(a)_ (other than with respect to
any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations) with
respect to any individual item or group of substantially related items of
Parent Losses if such individual item of Parent Losses or group of
substantially related items of Parent Losses is less than $50,000, and any
such individual item or group of substantially related items of Parent Losses
less than $50,000 shall not be counted towards the Parent Basket.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the total aggregate
amount the Parent Indemnified Parties will entitled to recover under this
_Article X_ for Parent Losses will be limited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund.
Amounts in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in respect of Parent Losses may
only be recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy to the extent covered
thereunder.

  



  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate
Losses for which indemnification may be claimed by such party pursuant to
this Agreement upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Losses, solely to the extent
required by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The amount of the payment for any Losses that any Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be reduced
to reflect (i) any Loss Tax Benefit and (ii) the recovery actually received
pursuant to any insurance policy in place prior to the Closing (other than
the RandW Insurance Policy); _provided_ , that, the amount deemed to be
recovered under such insurance policies will also be net of unrecovered
amounts, expenses and Taxes paid or incurred with respect to such proceeds,
including any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in procuring such
recovery, and net of the deductible for such policies for such policies to
the extent arising out of or in connection with such Losses. If an
indemnification payment is received by any Indemnified Party, and such
Indemnified Party later recognizes a Loss Tax Benefit, or insurance
recoveries, as described and subject to the limitations in the immediately
preceding sentence, in respect of the related Parent Losses or
indemnification payments that were not previously accounted for with respect
to such Parent Losses or indemnification payments when made, such Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party, and promptly, but in any event no
later than 15 Business Days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party or
Stockholder Representative on behalf of Equity Holders, as appropriate, an
amount equal to the lesser of (A) any such Loss Tax Benefit or insurance
recoveries and (B) the actual amount of the indemnification payments
previously made with respect to such Losses.

  



    

 | -84-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Person shall be liable to or otherwise responsible for punitive or exemplary
damages;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such limitation on damages shall not
apply to the extent awarded to a third party with respect to a Third Party
Claim for which an indemnification claim is brought. Each Party hereby waives
any claims that these exclusions deprive such Party of an adequate remedy.

  



  

Section 10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy in respect of monetary
damages against the Indemnifying Parties, whether in any individual,
corporate or any other capacity, with respect to any and all claims (other
than claims for Intentional Fraud or claims made in respect of the Transaction
Documents) relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement or the
Transactions, regardless of the legal theory under which such Liabilities may
be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in Contract or tort, or whether at
law or in equity, or otherwise, shall be pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article X_. The provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification,
and the limits imposed on the Indemnified Parties' remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the Merger Consideration to be paid hereunder. No
Indemnified Party may avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this
_Article X_ by seeking damages for breach of Contract, tort or pursuant to
any other theory of liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 10.6 _(or otherwise) shall limit the rights of Parent or the
Company to obtain specific performance of the other Parties' obligations
hereunder in accordance with _Section 11.8_ or their respective recourse in
respect of Intentional Fraud or claims made in respect of the Transaction
Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (a) this _Section
10.6 _will not affect the adjustments governed by _Section 3.9_ and (b) the
Company and the Stockholder Representative hereby waive any right or claims
against any Commitment Parties in connection with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters or the Financing or any transaction contemplated thereby,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.6 _will in any
way limit or modify the rights of Parent under this Agreement or any
Commitment Parties' obligations to Parent under the Commitment Letters.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ will be treated as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, without the consent of the
Company, (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests under this
Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates (in which case, Parent nonetheless
will remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations under
this Agreement), (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations under this Agreement (in which case, Parent nonetheless will
remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations under this
Agreement) and (c) assign this Agreement to its lenders for
collateral security purposes.

amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the
Parties;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

or waivers of _Section 10.6_, this _Section 11.3_, _Section 11.4_, _Section
11.6_,  _Section 11.7_, _Section 11.8_ and _Section 11.11_ (collectively,
the " _Financing Provisions_ ") (or any other provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment or waiver of such provision would modify the substance
of any Financing Provision) in a manner adverse to the Commitment Parties
will require the prior written consent of the Commitment Parties party to the
Commitment Letters on the date of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be
modified or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence
and any purported amendment by any Party or Parties effected in a manner
which does not comply with this _Section 11.3_ shall be void.

Section 11.5 _Captions_. The titles, captions and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are inserted in this Agreement only as a matter of

Section 11.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc_. Each Party hereby
irrevocably consents and agrees (a) that any Legal Dispute will be brought
solely and exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Dispute to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) not to bring or
permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support anyone
else in bringing any such Legal Dispute in any other court, (c) that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
its address provided in _Section 11.1_ will be effective service of process
against it for any such Legal Dispute brought in any such court, (d) to waive
and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal
Dispute in any such court, (e) that a final judgment in any such Legal
Dispute will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law and (f) to waive
irrevocably and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such Legal
Dispute to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to _Section 11.7_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party agrees
that it will not bring or support any proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Commitment Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing, the Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, or, if such court does not have
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York located in New York
County (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

  



  

Section 11.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
THE FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

Section 11.8 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement by the parties, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for such damages. Accordingly,
the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach by
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, will each be entitled
to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement (including the
obligation of the parties to consummate the Transactions, subject in each case
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any party, in addition to
any other remedy at Law or equity, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant
to the terms thereof and to thereafter consummate the Transactions.

  



    

 | -88-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Party (i) waives any defenses in any Legal Dispute for an
injunction or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate, (ii)
waives any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining an injunction or other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief and (iii) agrees that the only permitted
objection that it may raise in response to any Legal Dispute for an
injunction or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grant of specific performance
under this _Section 11.8_ shall not allow the Company to enforce
the Commitment Letters.

  



  

Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and it will not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than one of such counterparts. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic imaging means, including email transmission by PDF, will be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or
implied in this Agreement is intended, or will be construed, to confer
upon or give any Person other than the Parties, and their successors or
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or Liability under or by reason of this
Agreement, or result in such Person being deemed a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Commitment Parties and any
lenders or prospective lenders under the Financing will be third party
beneficiaries of and entitled to enforce the Financing Provisions.

  



    

 | -89-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 11.12 _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
extension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A
waiver by a Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation,
condition, representation or warranty will not be construed as a waiver of any
other covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty.
A waiver by any Party of the performance of any act will not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time.

  



  

Section 11.13 _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents
executed pursuant to this Agreement supersede all negotiations, agreements and
understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement (except for those certain confidentiality agreements, each dated as
of December 7, 2017, by and between BlueLinx Holdings Inc. and the Company and
that certain Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 28,
2018, by and between the Company and BlueLinx Holdings Inc., which the Parties
agree will automatically terminate as of the Closing without any further
action and be of no further force or effect) and constitute the entire
