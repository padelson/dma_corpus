W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions

that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are in the best interests of the Company and the Companys
shareholders and (ii) adopted this Agreement and approved the execution,

are in the best interests of Parent and Parents stockholders, and declared
that this Agreement is advisable, and (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, has resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company
approve this Agreement and to submit this Agreement to the shareholders of the
Company for approval;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ ") and
the Delaware  General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, the Company
shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in
the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will occur by electronic exchange
of documents at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on a date which shall be no
later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VII_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature
can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement
of the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the articles of merger (the " _Georgia Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (the " _Georgia Secretary_
") and the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date (the
" _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be
the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in
the Georgia Articles of Merger and the Delaware Certificate of Merger.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the GBCC and
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or
agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be
converted into the right to receive 1.160 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
of validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable shares (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "); it being understood that upon the
Effective Time, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, the Parent Common Stock,
including the shares issued to former holders of Company Common Stock, shall
be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ I_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate 

 



- 2 \-  (each, a " _Certificate_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to
" _Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a certificate representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive, (ii) cash
in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, without any
interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.
Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash
in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_,
without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company
Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction
granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") (hereinafter
sometimes referred to collectively as the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall
vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such Company
Restricted Stock Award deemed to have been achieved to the extent set forth in
the award agreement applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award) and be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates,
for exchange in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ II_, certificates or,
at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively,
referred to herein as " _certificates_ "), representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock, and cash in
lieu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be
issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Article_ __ _ I_, a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
_Article_ __ _ I_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_, and (B) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.2_, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive, and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 



- 5 \- (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_. After the surrender of a Certificate
in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate had been converted into the right to receive.

 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on The New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
(5) full trading days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing Date by
(ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholder of the
Company that has not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of 

 



- 6 \-  Company Common Stock such former shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

(g) Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made .

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine
is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent
Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article_ __ _
III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article_ __ _ III_

(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of

disclosed in any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the
Company after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or

or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or

 



- 7 \-  cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), or (c) for information
and documents commonly known as "confidential supervisory information" that is
prohibited from disclosure (and as to which nothing in this Agreement shall
require disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia, is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the " _BHC Act_ "), and is duly registered with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted in all material
respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As
used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities,
properties, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ that, with respect to this
clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact
of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or
in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as
changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services
industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement,
public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any effect on a partys relationships with its customers or
employees) or actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) a decline in the trading price of
a partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood that the
underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (F) the expenses
incurred by the Company or Parent in negotiating, documenting, effecting and
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (G) the
occurrence of any natural or man-made disaster; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B) and (C), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the
ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in Section 2(d) of the BHC Act. True and complete
copies of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Articles_ ") and the Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available

duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, and
(iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except in each of (ii) and (iii) as has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends
or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated
entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to
all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is an insured depository institution are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance
Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.

and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except
for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (including any notes

of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board

the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (B) to the knowledge of the Company, any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported

within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")
or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom
are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "

or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid,
have been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



- 17 \- (i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim
or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (iii) result in any limitation on the right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state or local law relating to Tax).

 

(l) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other

collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or
work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no organizing efforts by any
union or other group seeking to represent any employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries hold, and have held at all times since January 1, 2015, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have

its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare
and file with the SEC the S-4 (not later than 60 days following the date of
this Agreement), in which the Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep
the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall thereafter as
promptly as practicable mail or deliver the Joint Information Statement/Proxy
Statement to their respective stockholders or shareholders (as applicable);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may in its sole discretion determine
that, in lieu of filing with the SEC the Joint Information Statement/Proxy
Statement, (i) Parent shall file with the SEC a written information statement
in definitive form of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act relating to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Parents
stockholders (the " _Information Statement_ ") (it being understood that in
such case, the Information Statement, rather than the Joint Information
Statement/Proxy Statement, shall be mailed or delivered to the stockholders
of Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_) and (ii) the Company shall
file with the SEC a proxy statement in definitive form relating to the meeting
of the Companys shareholders to be held in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") (it being
understood that in such case, the Proxy Statement, rather than the Joint
Information Statement/Proxy Statement, shall be included in the S-4 and
mailed or delivered to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_). Parent shall also use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action.

 



- 44 \- (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause
to be prepared and filed, all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as
soon as practicable and in no event later than thirty (30) business days after
the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file any applications,
notices and filings required to be filed with any bank regulatory agency in
order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Parent and the Company
shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory
Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall consult with the other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or the Company to take any action (or permit the Company to, without
the prior written consent of Parent, take any action), or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders or shareholders (as applicable) and such other matters as may
be reasonably necessary or advisable 

 



- 45 \-  in connection with the Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement (or, if
applicable, the Information Statement and the Proxy Statement), the S-4 or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals from (i) the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC and (ii) any other
approvals set forth in _Sections 3.4_ and _4.4_ that are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Bank Merger, except for any such authorizations, consents,
orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent
and the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party,
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel,
information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with
the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate
or prejudice the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 



- 46 \- (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished
by or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated August 28, 2015, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Parent Stockholder Approval and Company Shareholder Approval_. Parent
shall obtain the Requisite Parent Vote by irrevocable written consent of the
holder (or holders) of the requisite number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Parent Written Consent_ ") no later than 10:00 a.m. New York City time
on the date immediately following the date of this Agreement, and shall
promptly deliver an executed copy of the Parent Written Consent to the
Company. The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ,") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting
of shareholders to approve a merger agreement. Except to the extent that the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by
communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement (or, if
applicable, the Proxy Statement)) that they approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the
purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section_ __
_ 6.1_ of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the
Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to
obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material

 



- 47 \-  consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time for so long as such
employee is employed following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an
annual short-term cash incentive opportunity that is substantially comparable
to the annual short-term cash incentive opportunity provided by Parent to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) other
compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits provided by Parent
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_
that Parent may satisfy its obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)(iii)_
for a transitional period by providing such compensation and employee benefits
on terms that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous the Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to
the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer
premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan, or (C) to any benefit plan
that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population.

 



- 48 \- (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms, subject to amendment or termination to the extent
permitted by such Company Benefit Plans. Without limitation to the generality
of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall (i) honor and discharge all
of the Companys obligations and assume all of its defenses under existing
severance, change of control or employment agreements to which the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company is a party and which are listed on _Section_ __
_ 6.6(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) pay severance
payments to all employees of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries whose
jobs are eliminated as a result of the Merger and whose employment is

practices as described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

the employee) prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) All accruals existing as of the Effective Time under the Companys and
its Subsidiaries non-equity incentive and/or bonus plans that are consistent

Directors of the Company shall be paid out to the applicable Continuing
Employees at the Closing.

(f) If requested by Parent in writing at least ten (10) business
days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to
be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by
Parent) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Effective Time
and (ii) the Continuing Employees of the Company shall be eligible to
participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_
"). Parent and the Company shall take any and all actions as may be required,
including amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to
permit the Continuing Employees of the Company who are then actively employed
to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
(excluding loans) equal to the full account balance distributed to such
Continuing Employee of the Company from a Company 401(k) Plan (excluding
loans).

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing

Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director

Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters,
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such
Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law;
_provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies

amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). In lieu of the foregoing,
the Company, in consultation with Parent, may (and at the request of Parent,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to) obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage
to that described in the preceding sentence. If the Company purchases such a
"tail policy," Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail
policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

 



- 50 \- (c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Company under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not be terminated or modified
after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party or affected person.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are not otherwise transferred and assumed by such
successors and assigns by operation of law or otherwise, the Surviving
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company (in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall each promptly advise the other party of any change
or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of the Notifying Partys representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, either
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in,
if Parent is the Notifying Party, _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _7.3_ , or if the
Company is the Notifying Party, _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _7.2_ ;  _provided_
that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect
to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section_
__ _ 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement
by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares

 



- 51 \-  of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such
holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of the
foregoing, (i) starting with the second quarter of 2018, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall cause its regular quarterly dividend record
dates and payments dates for Company Common Stock to be similar to the regular
quarterly dividend record dates and payments dates for Parent Common Stock
and (ii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall continue to pay dividends on
the Parent Common Stock on substantially the same record and payment date
schedules as have been utilized in the past.

 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) Effective immediately after the Effective Time, Parent and Parent Bank
shall increase the size of their respective Boards of Directors by three and
appoint three current members of the Board of Directors of the Company as
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time (each
such director, a " _Company Director_ ") to serve as directors of Parent and
Parent Bank. In furtherance of the foregoing, effective immediately after the
Effective Time, (i) the current Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Company shall be appointed to serve as the Vice Chairman of the Board of

Company Director must (A) be reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent and (B)
satisfy and comply with the requirements regarding service as a member of the
Board of Directors of each of Parent and Parent Bank, as provided under
applicable Law and the practices and policies of such Board of Directors that

of the Surviving Corporation and Parent Bank from and after the Effective Time
and the effective time of the Bank Merger, respectively, in accordance with
the respective bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and Parent Bank.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their officers,
directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have
or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_; _provided_ that, prior to the
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company by the Requisite
Company Vote, in the event the Company 

 



- 52 \-  receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and
participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board
of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_
_further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted
to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which confidentiality agreement shall not
provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company.
The Company will, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly advise Parent following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material
terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (A) withdraw and terminate access
that was granted to any person (other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective affiliates and Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual
or physical) that was established in connection with a transaction involving
the Company and (B) use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof and, in
accordance therewith. During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to
on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.12(a)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third
party indication of interest in, (1) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company, (2) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (3) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the
Company.

(b) Except as permitted by _Section 6.12(c)_, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to the Companys shareholders
that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
fail to include such recommendation

 



- 53 \-  in the Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement (or, if applicable, the
Proxy Statement), (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, such recommendation, (C) take any formal action or
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer
or exchange offer other than a recommendation of rejection of such offer or a
temporary "stop, look, and listen" communication by the Companys Board of
Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt,
approve, or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
Companys shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal (each of the actions described
in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement, or agreement in principle with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company
may, in connection with a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which
Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement (or that was
made prior to the date of this Agreement and remade after the date of this
Agreement) and that did not result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _
6.12_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, if and only if, prior to taking
such action, the Company has complied with its obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_ and the Board of Directors of the Company has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking any such action (i)
the Company has given Parent at least three (3) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including
the identity of the person or group of persons making such Superior Proposal)
and has contemporaneously provided a copy to Parent of all written materials
(including all transaction agreements and related documents) with or from the
party making such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the
end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In
the event of any material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that could have
an impact, influence, or other effect on the Companys Board of Directors
decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to
the foregoing clause (i) and again comply with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12(c)_ with respect to such new written notice; _provided_
, _however_ , that references herein to the three (3) Business Day period
shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period with respect
thereto. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that is reasonably likely to
result in the consummation of a transaction more favorable to the Companys
shareholders than the Merger, taking into account such factors as
the Companys Board of Directors in good faith deems relevant, including
legal,

 



- 54 \-  financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, and any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or
otherwise ( _provided_ , that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal," the references to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%").

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the Companys
shareholders; _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify
the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under
this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of _Article_
__ _ I_), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; _provided_ that no such change shall (a) alter or
change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
received by the Companys shareholders in exchange for each share of Company
Common Stock, (b) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys
shareholders or Parents stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (c)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Parent pursuant to this
Agreement or (d) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties
agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If the Company shall have failed to obtain
the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither
party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms,
including the Exchange Ratio, the amount or kind of the consideration to be
issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this
Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its respective shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable) and/or resubmit this Agreement and/or
the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_) to the shareholders of the Company for approval.

 



- 55 \- 6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.17 _Exemption from Liability under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. The Company
and Parent agree that to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and
for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_. The Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company,
or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall prior to the
Effective Time take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of
the Company) any dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards
by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

 

6.18 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken
by Parent, the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto
or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

6.19 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required

 



- 56 \-  for the due assumption of the Companys obligations in respect of its
outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent
required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

6.20 _Data Conversion_. From and after the date hereof, the parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of the
Company with the business of Parent following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and
plan for the conversion of the data processing and related electronic
information technology system (the " _Data Conversion_ ") to those used by
Parent. The parties agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly commence preparations for implementation of the Data Conversion,
with the goal of effecting the Data Conversion after the Effective Time and at
such later time as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The parties agree to
cooperate in preparing for the Data Conversion, including by providing
reasonable access to data, information systems, and personnel having expertise
with their and their respective Subsidiaries information and data systems;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither party shall be required to terminate
any third-party service provider arrangements prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company on request for reasonable out-of-
pocket fees, expenses or charges that the Company may incur as a result of
taking, at the request of Parent, any action prior to the Effective Time to
facilitate the Data Conversion.

to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Termination Date may be extended by mutual written consent of the parties, and
(ii) if on the Termination Date, any of the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Sections 7.1(c)_ and _7.1(d)_ shall not have been satisfied but all other
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ shall be satisfied or capable
of being satisfied, then the Termination Date shall be extended an additional
30 days if either party notifies the other party in writing on or prior to the
Termination Date of its election to extend the Termination Date; _provided_
_further_ , unless the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination
Date shall be due to the failure of such party seeking to extend or terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or

 



- 60 \-  Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure
to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by
such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true),
would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of a termination
by Parent, or _7.3_ , in the case of a termination by the Company, and which
is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to the
Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a
termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during
such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

(e) by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed
to recommend in the Joint Information Statement/Proxy Statement (or, if
applicable, the Proxy Statement) that the shareholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do so,
or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer
constituting an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed within
ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange
offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof or (B)
recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal or failed to issue a press
release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal within ten (10)
business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, or (ii)
the Company or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or _6.12_ in any material respect;

 

(f) by the Company, if the Requisite Company Vote is not obtained at the
Company Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in order to
enter into a definitive merger agreement or other definitive purchase or
acquisition agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Company has complied with  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ in
all material respects and (ii) the Company pays (or causes to be paid) the
Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination;

 

(g) by the Company, if the Parent Written Consent shall not have been
delivered to the Company prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the date
immediately following the date of this Agreement; or

(h) by the Company, at any time during the five-day period commencing with
the Determination Date, if both (i) the number obtained by dividing the
Determination Date Average Closing Price by the Starting Price (the " _Parent
Ratio_ ") shall be less than 0.85, and (ii) (1) the Parent Ratio is less than
(2) the number obtained by dividing the Determination Date Index Price by the
Initial Index Price (the " _Index Ratio_ ") and subtracting 0.15 from the
Index Ratio.

This Agreement shall terminate on the fifth (5th) business day following the
date written notice of termination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_
is provided to Parent (the " _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h) Termination Date_");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys notice of termination pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ may be withdrawn at any time prior to the
Section 8.1(h) Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that during the five
(5) business day period commencing with Parents receipt of such notice,
Parent shall have the option to increase the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the
nearest one-thousandth), such that the value of the Merger Consideration that
each share of 

 



- 61 \-  Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in the Merger (calculated
based on the Determination Date Average Closing Price) equals: an amount equal
to the lesser of (1) the product of the Starting Price, 0.85 and the Exchange
Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_) or (2) (x) the product of the Index
Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any
increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_) and
the Determination Date Average Closing Price, divided by (y) the Parent Ratio.
If Parent elects to increase the Exchange Ratio within such five (5) business
day period, it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such
election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , that any
references in this Agreement shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_.

For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, (i) " _Determination Date_ "

Bank Index during the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending on the
trading day prior to the Determination Date, as reported by Bloomberg LP

of the Nasdaq Bank Index on the last trading day immediately preceding the
date of the first public announcement of this Agreement, as reported by
Bloomberg LP (symbol: CBNK).

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that

 

(i) _Section 6.2(b)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and  _Article_ __ _
IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and

 

(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination.

 



- 62 \- (b) 

 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of the Company or has been made directly
to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Company Vote having
been obtained (and all other conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_
had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such
termination) or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ as a result of a willful breach, and (C) prior to
the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement, or consummates a transaction, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of
the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation
of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $37,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that for purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and the issuance of the order or the
taking of the action by the applicable Governmental Entity under Section
8.1(b) is caused primarily by regulatory concerns related to Parent or its
Subsidiaries, Parent shall, on the date of termination, pay to the Company,
by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting
the right of Parent to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the
Companys fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees,
liabilities or damages payable by the Company under this Agreement shall be
equal to the Termination Fee, and the Company shall not be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay any amount
due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such

 



- 63 \-  payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment
against such party for the Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement, as
applicable, the party failing to make such payment shall pay the costs and
expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if either party fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, then such
party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as
of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co.
or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the
Company pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_ and _8.2(b)(ii)_ constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or
willful and material breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary
remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such sections.

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of

original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was

delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
