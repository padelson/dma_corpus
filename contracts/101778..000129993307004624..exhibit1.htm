withhold from such consideration in accordance with applicable Tax Laws. Any such amounts will be

deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to
the appropriate Taxing Authority.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>2.15 Tax Election</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 5%">Western or the member of the Western Group that sells the WesternZagros Shares to SpinCo (as
defined in the Plan of Arrangement), as applicable, (the &#147;<B>Electing Party</B>&#148;) shall be entitled to
make an income tax election pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the ITA (and analogous provisions of
provincial income tax law) with respect to such transfer following the Effective Time by providing
two duly completed signed copies of the necessary election form to SpinCo at any time following the
Effective Date. The elected amount therein shall be the lesser of $412,669,383 and the aggregate
redemption amount of the redeemable preferred shares issued by SpinCo to the Electing Party.
Thereafter, subject to the election form complying with the provisions of the ITA (or applicable
provincial income tax law) the forms shall be signed by SpinCo and returned to Western within 30
days after receipt thereof. SpinCo will not be responsible for the proper completion of any
election form and, except for the obligation of SpinCo to sign and return a duly completed election
form, SpinCo will not be responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the
failure of the Electing Party to properly complete or file the election form in the form and manner
and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial legislation).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 5%">Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchaser Termination Fee set out in Section&nbsp;6.1 is a payment
of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Purchaser will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination
of this Agreement and is not a penalty. Western irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty,
Purchaser agrees that the payment of the amount pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.1 is the sole monetary remedy
of Purchaser. Nothing herein shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any
breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such act, covenants
or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 5%">Each of Purchaser and Western agree to consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement or
making any filing with any Governmental Authority with respect thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no Party shall issue any press release regarding the Arrangement, this
Agreement or any transaction relating to this Agreement without first providing a draft of such
press release to the other Party and reasonable opportunity for comment; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall be subject to each Party&#146;s overriding obligation to make any such disclosure
required in accordance with Applicable Laws. If such disclosure is required and the other Party has
not reviewed or commented on the disclosure, the Party making such disclosure shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written notice to the other Party, and if
such prior notice is not possible, to give such notice promptly following such disclosure.

contained herein shall be and shall be conclusively deemed to be severable therefrom and the
validity, legality or enforceability of such remaining provisions or parts thereof shall not in any
way be affected or impaired by the severance of the provisions or parts thereof severed. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

with the details of the number of shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for the

returned to such former holders of Class&nbsp;A Shares within 30&nbsp;days after the receipt thereof by
Western for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial taxing authority).
AcquisitionCo and Western will not be responsible for the proper completion of any election form

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be

payable to the holder, Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon and the Depositary are hereby authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such other portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide

the provisions of Section&nbsp;191 of the ABCA. The fair value of the Common Shares shall be determined
as of the close of business on the last business day before the day on which the Arrangement is
approved by the holders of Common Shares at the Meeting; but in no event shall Western be required
to recognize such Dissenting Shareholder as a shareholder of Western after the Effective Time and
the names of such holders shall be removed from the applicable register of shareholders as at the
Effective Time. For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Section&nbsp;191 of the
