with the Registrar pursuant to Subsection 193(10) of the ABCA, whereupon the

have occurred in the order set out therein without any further act or
formality.

Arrangement Resolution shall be two thirds of the votes cast by the Western
Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Western Meeting.  
---|---|---

Authority under any Applicable Laws or pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any Governmental Authority administering such Laws, or the fulfillment
of any other legal requirement in any such jurisdiction (other than, with
respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by reason of,
among other things, a holder being a "control person" of Purchaser or Western
for purposes of Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities Laws);
and  
---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | Purchaser shall prepare and file a registration

under any applicable Canadian and United States federal, provincial,
territorial or state securities Laws (including "blue sky laws") in

Shares in connection with the Arrangement; provided, however, that with
respect to the United States "blue sky" and Canadian
provincial qualifications neither Purchaser nor Western shall be required to

now so subject, except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the
offer of the Exchangeable Shares and the Purchaser Shares in connection with
the Arrangement; and

Western Option Plan. Purchaser acknowledges that Western may provide
financing to the Optionees to facilitate the exercise of Western Options
prior to the Effective Date on terms, conditions and
documentation satisfactory to Purchaser, acting reasonably, provided that
Western will retain a security interest in any such shares and any proceeds
therefrom (including any proceeds received pursuant to the Arrangement) until
such financing is repaid;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | Western shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to

unanimously approved the Arrangement and the entering into of the Arrangement
Agreement and has resolved unanimously to recommend Western Shareholders vote
in favour of the Arrangement. Notice of such approvals, determinations and
resolution shall, subject to the terms hereof, be included, along with the
written fairness opinions of WesternÂ’s financial advisors, confirming the
aforementioned opinions of such financial advisors, in the Information
Circular.   

2.10 Dissenting Shareholders   

Registered Western Shareholders entitled to vote at the Western Meeting may
exercise Dissent Rights with respect to their Western Common Shares in
connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in
the Plan of Arrangement. Western shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any
written notice of a dissent, withdrawal of such notice, and any other
instruments served pursuant to such Dissent Rights and received by Western
and provide Purchaser with copies of such notices and written
objections.   

2.11 Disclosure Letter   

Notwithstanding anything in the Disclosure Letter to the contrary, all
disclosures in the Disclosure Letter must reference a particular Section in
this Agreement in order to be deemed to relate to or modify such Section of
this Agreement. The inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Letter shall not
be construed as an admission by Western of the materiality of such item.   

2.12 Tax Withholdings   

Purchaser and AcquisitionCo shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Western Shareholder and, for greater
certainty, from any amount payable to a Dissenting Shareholder, as the case
may be, under the Plan of Arrangement such amounts as Purchaser or
AcquisitionCo are required or reasonably believed to be required to deduct
and withhold from such consideration in accordance with applicable Tax Laws.
Any such amounts will be deducted and withheld from the consideration payable
pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the Western Shareholder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts
are actually remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority.   

2.13 Marathon Guarantee   

Marathon hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and
punctual performance by AcquisitionCo of each and every covenant and
obligation of AcquisitionCo arising under the Arrangement, including, without
limitation, the due and punctual payment of the Purchase Funds, Exchangeable
Shares and Purchaser Shares pursuant to the Arrangement. Marathon hereby
agrees that Western shall not have to proceed first against AcquisitionCo
before exercising its rights under this guarantee against Marathon.   

2.14 Western Guarantee   

Western hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual
performance by WesternZagros of each and every covenant and obligation of
WesternZagros arising under the Arrangement. Western hereby agrees that
Marathon shall not have to proceed first against WesternZagros before
exercising its rights under this guarantee against Western.   

2.15 Tax Election   

Western or the member of the Western Group that sells the WesternZagros Shares
to SpinCo (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement), as applicable, (the
"Electing Party") shall be entitled to make an income tax election pursuant
to subsection 85(1) of the ITA (and analogous provisions of provincial income
tax law) with respect to such transfer following the Effective Time by
providing two duly completed signed copies of the necessary election form to
SpinCo at any time following the Effective Date. The elected amount therein
shall be the lesser of $412,669,383 and the aggregate redemption amount of
the redeemable preferred shares issued by SpinCo to the Electing
Party. Thereafter, subject to the election form complying with the provisions
of the ITA (or applicable provincial income tax law) the forms shall be
signed by SpinCo and returned to Western within 30 days after receipt
thereof. SpinCo will not be responsible for the proper completion of
any election form and, except for the obligation of SpinCo to sign and return
a duly completed election form, SpinCo will not be responsible for any taxes,
interest or penalties resulting from the failure of the Electing Party to
properly complete or file the election form in the form and manner and within
the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial
legislation).

---|---|---|--- 
      

such transactions to be implemented in a manner satisfactory to Purchaser,
acting reasonably;   

     (gg)  |   | Western and WesternZagros will use their reasonable
commercial efforts to, prior to the Closing Time, assign and novate or

3.4 Mutual Covenants Regarding the Arrangement   

From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Date or termination of
this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Western will use its reasonable
commercial efforts to: (i) satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the
conditions precedent to its obligations (and those of any of
its subsidiaries) hereunder; (ii) not take, or cause to be taken, any action

fulfilled in a timely manner; and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all other
action and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Laws to complete the Arrangement, including using
reasonable commercial efforts:   

     (a)  |   | to ensure that the Information Circular provides
Western Shareholders with information in sufficient detail to permit them to
form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters before them, and, in that
regard, the Information Circular will set out the Purchaser Information
in the form approved by Purchaser and the Western Information in the form
approved by Western and shall include, without limitation: (i) any financial
statements in respect of prior acquisitions made by Western that are required
to be included therein in accordance with Applicable Laws; (ii) the unanimous
determination of the Western Board of Directors that the Arrangement is fair
to Western Shareholders and is in the best interests of Western and Western
Shareholders, and include the unanimous recommendation of the Western Board

respect of the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view,
to Western Shareholders;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | to, on or before the Effective Date, cause

including any amendments required as a result of the planning and
implementation of the matters set forth in Section 3.3(ff) and assist the
other Party and its tax advisors in making such investigations and inquiries
with respect to such Party in that regard, as the other Party and its
tax advisors shall consider necessary, acting reasonably, provided that
Western shall not be obligated to consent or agree to any structuring
contemplated by this Section 3.4(e) that has the effect of reducing the
consideration to be received under the Arrangement by the
Western Shareholders or the tax deferred treatment to such securityholders in
respect of the Exchangeable Shares to be received by such securityholders
under the ITA; and  
---|---|--- 
     

     (f)  |   | to cause the Effective Date to occur on or before
November 30, 2007 (the "Outside Date") and to cause the mailing of the
Information Circular to Western Shareholders to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof and in any event by October 1, 2007
(the "Mailing Date").  
---|---|--- 
     

Each of Purchaser and Western will use its reasonable commercial efforts to
cooperate with the other in connection with the performance by the other of
their obligations under this Section 3.4 and this Agreement including,
without limitation, continuing to provide reasonable access to information
and to maintain ongoing communications as between officers of Purchaser and
Western, subject in all cases to the Confidentiality Agreement.   

3.5 Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation   

     (a)  |   | Western shall and shall cause the officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents of it and its subsidiaries to
immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
(other than Purchaser) with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to constitute, an Acquisition Proposal and to

---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | Subject to Sections 3.5(c), (d), (e) and (f), Western

---|---|--- 
     

       | (i)  |   | solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the
initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (ii)  |   | participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iii)  |   | withdraw or modify or propose publicly to

---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iv)  |   | furnish or provide access to any information
concerning Western, its subsidiaries or their respective businesses,

reasonably be expected to lead to or facilitate, an Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (v)  |   | waive any provisions of or release or terminate
any confidentiality or standstill agreement between Western and any Person
relating to an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal, or amend any such
agreement or consent to the making of an Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with the terms of such agreement; or  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (vi)  |   | accept, recommend, approve or enter into or
propose publicly to accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality agreement as
permitted hereunder) related to any Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (c)  |   | Prior to the Effective Date, Western and its officers,
directors, employees, advisors or other representatives or agents may enter
into, or participate in, any discussions or negotiations with a Person who
seeks to initiate such discussions or negotiations and, subject to the
entering into by such Person of a confidentiality agreement substantially
similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, may furnish to such Person
information concerning Western and its business, properties and assets, in
each case if, and only to the extent that:  
---|---|--- 
     

       | (i)  |   | such Person has first made an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal which the Western Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) would, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, be reasonably likely to result in,
a Superior Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (ii)  |   | the Western Board of Directors, after receiving
the advice of outside legal counsel, has determined in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Western Board of Directors to the Western Shareholders; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iii)  |   | Western has provided to Purchaser the
information required to be provided under Section 3.5(e) in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal and has promptly notified Purchaser in writing of the
determinations in paragraphs 3.5(c)(i) and (ii) above;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | If, prior to the Effective Time, Western receives a
request from a Person who is subject to a standstill obligation to waive or
release such Person from its standstill obligation in order to make an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal, Western may release such Person
from its standstill obligation only to the extent required to allow such
Person to provide the Acquisition Proposal for consideration by the Western
Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 3.5 and to enter into, or
participate in, any discussions or negotiations with Western and be furnished
with information concerning Western, to the extent permitted pursuant to
Section 3.5(c);  
---|---|--- 
     

     (e)  |   | Western shall promptly notify Purchaser, at first
orally and then in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal received after the
date hereof, of any confidentiality agreement entered into in respect of any
such Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry or contact received after the date
hereof that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
or any request for non-public information relating to Western received after
the date hereof or for access to the properties, books or records of Western
by any Person that informs Western that it is considering making, or has
made, an Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof; which notice will
include any known material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (including any form of agreement proposed to be entered into) and
shall indicate such details, to the extent known, of the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or contact as Purchaser may reasonably request, including
the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry or contact. Western
shall keep Purchaser informed of the status, including any change to
the material terms, of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. In addition,
Western shall provide Purchaser with a list of or copies of the information
provided to any Person in respect of which a confidentiality agreement is
entered into in respect of any Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section
3.5(c) and shall provide Purchaser with access to any information provided to
any such Person;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (f)  |   | Western shall give Purchaser, orally and in writing, at
least three (3) Business Days advance notice of any decision by the Western
Board of Directors to accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement
to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall confirm that the Western
Board of Directors has determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal, shall identify the Person making the Superior Proposal
and shall provide a true and complete copy thereof and any amendments
thereto. During such three (3) Business Day period, Western agrees not to
accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such
Superior Proposal and shall not withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement or waive any provision of any
standstill obligation with respect thereto except as permitted in Section
3.5(d). In addition, during such three (3) Business Day period Western shall,
and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith
with Purchaser and its financial and legal advisors, to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would
enable Western to proceed with the Arrangement as amended rather than the
Superior Proposal. In the event Purchaser proposes to amend this Agreement
and the Arrangement to provide that the Western Shareholders shall receive a
value per Western Common Share equal to or having a value greater than the
value per Western Common Share provided in the Superior Proposal and so
advises the Western Board of Directors prior to the expiry of such three (3)
Business Day period, the Western Board of Directors shall not accept,
recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior
Proposal and shall not release the party making the Superior Proposal from
any standstill provisions and shall not withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement. If the Western Board of
Directors continues to believe that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal and therefore rejects PurchaserÂ’s amended proposal, Western may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iv), provided however,
that Western must pay to the Purchaser the Purchaser Termination Fee
concurrently with such termination. In the event that Western provides
Purchaser with a copy of the notice referred to in this Section 3.5(f) on a
date that is less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Western Meeting,
Western shall adjourn the Meeting to a date that is not less than three (3)
Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days after the date of the
notice;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (g)  |   | Nothing contained in this Section 3.5 shall prohibit
the Western Board of Directors from: (i) making any disclosure of an
Acquisition Proposal to the Western Shareholders prior to the Effective Time
if, in the good faith judgment of the Western Board of Directors
after receiving the advice of outside counsel, such disclosure is necessary
for the Western Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its
fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under Applicable Law; (ii) taking
any other action with regard to an Acquisition Proposal to the extent ordered
or otherwise mandated by any court of competent jurisdiction;
(iii) responding to a bona fide request for information that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal solely by advising that no
information can be provided unless a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
is made and then only in compliance with Section 3.5(c); (iv) complying with
Section 172 of the Securities Act and similar provisions under
Applicable Laws relating to the provision of directorsÂ’ circulars and making
appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to Western Shareholders; and (v)
waiving the application of the Western Shareholder Rights Plan in respect of
any Superior Proposal but only following WesternÂ’s compliance with Section
3.5(f);  
---|---|--- 
     

     (h)  |   | Western also acknowledges and agrees that each
successive material modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute
a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the requirement under Section
3.5(f) to initiate an additional three (3) Business Day notice period;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (i)  |   | The Western Board of Directors shall promptly reaffirm
its recommendation of the Arrangement by press release after any Acquisition
Proposal (which is determined not to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly
announced or made; and  
---|---|--- 
     

     (j)  |   | Purchaser agrees that all information that may be
provided to it by Western with respect to any Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to this Section 3.5 shall be treated as if it were "Confidential Information"
as that term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement and shall not be
disclosed or used except in accordance with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement or in order to enforce its rights under this
Agreement in legal proceedings.  
---|---|--- 
     

3.6 Provision of Information; Access   

Until the Effective Date or termination of this Agreement, each Party agrees
to keep the Other Party fully appraised in a timely manner of every
circumstance, action, occurrence or event occurring or arising after the date
hereof that would be relevant and material to a prudent operator of the
business and operations of Western and Purchaser. Each Party shall confer with
and obtain the approval of the Other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), prior to taking action (other than in emergency situations) with
respect to any material operational matters involved in its business.

do business, as applicable, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the character of its assets and properties, owned or leased, or the
nature of its activities makes such registration or authorization necessary,
except where the failure to be so registered or authorized would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Purchaser. Copies of the constating documents of the Purchaser Parties
provided to Western, together with all amendments to date, are accurate and
complete as of the date hereof and have not been amended or superseded;  
---|---|---

been duly authorized by the Purchaser Board of Directors and the
AcquisitionCo Board of Directors and no other proceedings on the part of
Purchaser or AcquisitionCo are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
Arrangement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and AcquisitionCo and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Purchaser and AcquisitionCo enforceable against each of
Purchaser and AcquisitionCo in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by

other Laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are
discretionary and may not be ordered;  
---|---|---

transactions contemplated by the Arrangement nor compliance by the Purchaser
Parties with any of the provisions hereof will: (A) violate, conflict with,
or result in a breach of any provision of, require any consent, approval or
notice under, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of
any encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of the Purchaser Parties
or cause any indebtedness to come due before its stated maturity or cause any
credit to cease to be available, under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of: (1) the certificate of incorporation, articles or by-laws of

Purchaser Party is bound; or (B) subject to compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations, violate any judgment, ruling, order,
writ, injunction, determination, award, decree, statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to the Purchaser Parties or any of their properties or
assets (except, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) above, for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or
creations of encumbrances which, or any consents, approvals or notices which
if not given or received, would not, individually or in the aggregate have
any Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, or significantly impede the ability
of the Purchaser Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Arrangement); or (C) cause the suspension or revocation of any authorization,
consent, approval or license currently in effect which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Purchaser; and  
---|---|---|---

not, individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
Purchaser, or significantly impede the ability of the Purchaser Parties to
consummate the Arrangement;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | _Financing_. Purchaser has sufficient means and on the

is a reasonable basis, affecting or that would reasonably be expected to
affect Purchaser and its subsidiaries or affecting or that would reasonably
be expected to affect any of their respective properties or assets at law or
equity or before or by any court or Governmental Authority which claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation, arbitration, audit, grievance,
assessment or reassessment involves a possibility of any judgment against or
liability of Purchaser and its subsidiaries which, if successful, would
reasonably be expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Change to Purchaser, or would significantly impede the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the Arrangement;  
---|---|---

---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (xiii)  |   | any waiver of any provisions of, or release or
termination of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement by any member of

       | (xv)  |   | any agreement by any member of the Western Group
to do any of the foregoing;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (o)  |   | _Registration, Exemption Orders, Licenses, etc_. To the
knowledge of Western, Western has obtained and is in compliance with all
licenses, permits, certificates, consents, orders, grants, registrations,
recognition orders, exemption relief orders, no-action relief and
other Governmental Authorizations, except where the failure to obtain or be
in compliance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Western. Such Governmental
Authorizations are in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice
or lapse of time) may constitute or result in a violation of any such
Governmental Authorization, except where the violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Western. No proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of
Western, threatened, which could result in the revocation or limitation of any
Governmental Authorization, and all steps have been taken and filings made on
a timely basis with respect to each Governmental Authorization and its
renewal, except where the failure to take such steps and make such filings
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Western;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (p)  |   | _Compliance with Laws_. The operations and business of
each member of the Western Group is and has been carried out in compliance
with and not in violation of any Applicable Laws, other than non-compliance
or violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Western, and Western has not
received any notice of any alleged violation of any such Laws other than where
such notice would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Western;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (q)  |   | _Restrictions on Business Activities_. There is no
judgment, injunction or order binding upon any member of the Western Group
that has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting,
restricting or impairing its business or, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Western;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (r)  |   | _Non-Arm Â’s Length Transactions_. There are no material
Contracts or other transactions currently in place between any member of the
Western Group, on the one hand, and (i) any officer or director of a member
of Western, (ii) any holder of record or beneficial owner of 10% or more of
the voting securities of Western or (iii) any affiliate of any such
officer, director or beneficial owner, on the other hand;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (s)  |   | _Title_. Although it does not warrant title, Western
has no reason to believe that Western or its subsidiaries, other than
WesternZagros for which no representation and warranty is given, does not
have title to or the right to produce and sell their petroleum, natural
gas and related hydrocarbons (for the purpose of this clause, the foregoing
are referred to as the "Interests") and does represent and warrant that the
Interests are free and clear of adverse claims created by, through or under
the Western Group (other than WesternZagros) except as disclosed in the
Public Record, any governmental registry or those arising in the
ordinary course of business, which are not material in the aggregate, and
that, to the best of its knowledge, information and belief, Western holds the
Interests under valid and subsisting leases, licences, permits, concessions,
concession agreements, contracts, subleases, reservations or other
agreements, except where the failure to hold such rights in the event of such
adverse claims or the failure to so hold its Interest would, individually or
in the aggregate, not have a Material Adverse Effect on Western;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (t)  |   | _GLJ Report_. Western has made available to GLJ
Petroleum Consultants Ltd. ("GLJ"), prior to the issuance of GLJ Report, for
the purpose of preparing the GLJ Report, all information requested by GLJ,
which information did not contain any misrepresentation at the time such
information was provided. Except with respect to changes in the prices of oil
and gas, Western has no knowledge of a material adverse change in any
production, cost price, reserves or other relevant information provided to
GLJ since the date that such information was provided. Western believes that
the GLJ Report reasonably presents the quantity and pre-tax present worth
values of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the crude oil,
natural gas liquids and natural gas properties evaluated in such report as of
its effective date based upon information available at the time such reserves
information was prepared, and Western believes that, at the date of such
report, such report did not (and as of the date hereof, except as may be
attributable to production since the date of such report does not) overstate
the aggregate quantity or pre-tax present worth values of such reserves
or the estimated monthly production volumes therefrom;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (u)  |   | _Environmental_. To the knowledge of Western, each of
the Western Parties (i) is in compliance with any and all applicable
Environmental Laws, (ii) has received and is in compliance with all permits,
licenses or other approvals required of it under applicable Environmental
Laws to conduct its respective businesses and (iii) has not received notice
of any actual or potential liability, proceeding, application, order or
directive for the investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of
Hazardous Substances or otherwise as may require any material work, repairs,
construction or expenditure or any demand or notice with respect to the
breach of any Environmental Laws applicable to any member of the
Western Group, including, without limitation, any regulations respecting the
use, storage, treatment, transportation or disposition of any Hazardous
Substance, except, in the cases of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), where such
non-compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required permits,
licenses or other approvals, or liability or other matter would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Western;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (v)  |   | _Public Record_. Since January 1, 2007, the information
and statements set forth in the Public Record were true, correct and complete
in all material respects as of the date of such information and statements
and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (w)  |   | _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. None of Western
or any of its subsidiaries has any material liabilities of any nature
(matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent), other than:  
---|---|--- 
     

       | (i)  |   | those set forth or adequately provided for in the

business and not required to be set forth in the Western Balance Sheet under
GAAP;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (iii)  |   | those incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the date of the Western Balance Sheet and consistent with past
practice; and  
---|---|---|---

of this Agreement;

     (x)  |   | _Employee Benefit Plans_. Western has provided to
Purchaser true, complete and correct copies of each employee benefits plan
(collectively, the "Western Plans") covering active, former or retired
employees of each member of the Western Group, any related trust
agreement, annuity or insurance contract or other funding vehicle, and: (i)
each Western Plan has been maintained and administered in material compliance
with its terms and is, to the extent required by Applicable Law or contract,
fully funded without having any deficit or unfunded actuarial liability or
adequate provision has been made therefor; (ii) all required
employer contributions under any such plans have been made and the applicable
funds have been funded in accordance with the terms thereof; (iii) each
Western Plan that is required or intended to be qualified under Applicable
Law or registered or approved by a Governmental Authority has been so
qualified, registered or approved by the appropriate Governmental Authority,
and to the knowledge of Western, nothing has occurred since the date of the
last qualification, registration or approval that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect, or cause, the appropriate Governmental
Authority to revoke such qualification, registration or approval; (iv) to the
knowledge of Western, there are no pending or anticipated material claims
against or otherwise involving any of the Western Plans and no suit, action
or other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary

account of this Agreement, any transaction contemplated hereby or any
transaction presently ongoing or contemplated, except that Goldman, Sachs and
Co., TD Securities Inc. and Tristone Capital Inc. have been retained as
WesternÂ’s financial advisors in connection with certain matters including the
transactions contemplated hereby. Western has delivered to the Purchaser
Parties a true and complete copy of its agreements with Goldman, Sachs and Co.

agreements without PurchaserÂ’s consent. There are no fees payable to such
advisors other than those disclosed in such agreements;

---|---|--- 
     

     (bb)  |   | _Insurance_. Policies of insurance that are in force
as of the date hereof naming any member of the Western Group as an insured
adequately and reasonably cover all risks as are customarily covered by oil

All such policies shall remain in force and effect and shall not be cancelled

Agreement;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (cc)  |   | _Board Approval_. The Western Board of Directors has
unanimously endorsed the Arrangement and approved this Agreement, has
unanimously determined that the Arrangement and this Agreement are in the

things, based on the opinion of its financial advisors, unanimously

from a financial point of view, to Western Shareholders and has resolved to

---|---|---

Shareholder Rights Plan will not apply to the Arrangement and prior to the
Effective Time, Western will not implement any other shareholder rights plan

---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | _Board and Shareholder Authorization_ : Western and

notice may be delivered by Purchaser.   

5.3 Additional Conditions to Obligations of Western   

The obligation of Western to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
and in particular the Arrangement, is subject to the following
conditions:   

     (a)  |   | _Representations and Warranties_ : The representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth herein (i) that are qualified by a
reference to Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Effective Date as if made on and as of such date, and (ii)
that are not qualified by a reference to a Material Adverse Effect shall be
true and correct in all respects as of the Effective Date as if made on and
as of such date unless the failure to be true or correct has not had or would

purpose, any reference to "material" or other concepts of materiality in such
representations and warranties shall be ignored), except in each case (i) to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date (in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in

     (b)  |   | _Covenants_ : The Purchaser Parties shall have complied

     (c)  |   | _No Actions_ : no act, action, suit, proceeding,

directive (whether or not having the force of law) shall have been proposed,
enacted, promulgated, amended or applied, which in the sole judgment of

the Arrangement;  
---|---|---

terminate this Agreement (save and except for Article 6, Section 4.4, Section
2.13 and Section 2.14 hereof which shall survive such termination and remain

Each of Purchaser and Western shall give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof to the
Effective Date of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure
would, or would be likely to: (i) cause any of the representations or
warranties of such Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect; or (ii) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any
Party hereunder; provided, however, that no such notification will affect the
representations or warranties of the Parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties hereunder.   

5.5 Satisfaction of Conditions   

The conditions set out in this Article 5 are conclusively deemed to have been
satisfied, waived or released when, with the agreement of the Parties,
Articles of Arrangement are filed under the ABCA to give effect to the
Arrangement.   

ARTICLE 6    

AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS    

6.1 Purchaser Damages   

Provided that there is no material breach of a representation or warranty by
Purchaser or AcquisitionCo or material non performance by Purchaser or
AcquisitionCo of any covenant by the date specified herein (excluding the
breach of a covenant where Purchaser is precluded from satisfying its
obligations through action or omission of Western), if at any time after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to its termination:   

     (a)  |   | the Western Board of Directors fails to make or has
withdrawn, modified or publicly proposes to withdraw or modify the approvals,
recommendation or determinations referred to in Section 2.9 in a manner
adverse to Purchaser or shall have resolved to do so prior to the Effective
Date;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced,
proposed, offered or made to the Western Shareholders and the Western
Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement or the Arrangement is not
submitted for their approval prior to the Outside Date and any Acquisition
Proposal is consummated within twelve months from the termination of this
Agreement;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (c)  |   | Western accepts, recommends, approves or enters into or
publicly proposes to accept, recommend or approve an agreement to implement a
Superior Proposal subject to compliance with Section 3.5; or  
---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | Western breaches the provisions of Section 3.5 in any
material respect, and Purchaser is not successful in completing the
Arrangement,  
---|---|--- 
     

(each of Section 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.1(c) and 6.1(d) above being a "Purchaser
Damages Event", then in the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 8, Western shall pay to Purchaser $200,000,000 (the
"Purchaser Termination Fee") as liquidated damages in respect of a Purchaser
Damages Event in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Purchaser within one Business Day after the first to occur of the events
described above. Following a Purchaser Damages Event, but prior to payment of
the Purchaser Termination Fee, Western shall be deemed to hold such
applicable payment in trust for Purchaser. Western shall only be obligated to
pay one Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 6.1.   

6.2 Liquidated Damages   

Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchaser Termination Fee set out in Section
6.1 is a payment of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of
the damages which the Purchaser will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement
and is not a penalty. Western irrevocably waives any right it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, Purchaser agrees that the payment of the
amount pursuant to Section 6.1 is the sole monetary remedy of Purchaser.
Nothing herein shall preclude a Party from seeking injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain
specific performance of any of such act, covenants or agreements, without the
necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.   

ARTICLE 7    

AMENDMENT    

7.1 Amendment   

This Agreement may at any time and from time to time before or after the
holding of the Western Meeting be amended by written agreement of the Parties
hereto without, subject to Applicable Law, further notice to or authorization
on the part of their respective securityholders and any such amendment may,
without limitation:   

     (a)  |   | change the time for performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the Parties;  
---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;  
---|---|---

herein contained and waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of
the Parties; or  
---|---|--- 
     

     (d)  |   | waive compliance with or modify any other conditions
precedent contained herein;  
---|---|--- 
     

provided that no such amendment reduces or materially adversely affects the
consideration to be received by a Western Shareholder without approval by the
affected securityholders given in the same manner as required for the
approval of the Arrangement or as may be ordered by the Court.   

ARTICLE 8    

TERMINATION

Damages Event as provided in Section 6.1, provided that Western has paid to

purpose, any reference to "material" or other concepts of materiality in
such representations and warranties shall be ignored) on Purchaser or, in
either case, such breach materially impedes the completion of the
Arrangement, and Purchaser fails to cure or cause the cure of such breach
within five Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from
Western (except that no cure period shall be provided for a breach which by
its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend
beyond the Outside Date); or  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (vi)  |   | by Purchaser if:  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (A)  |   | Western is in breach of any of its covenants made

affairs, operations or business of any of the Western Parties or materially
impedes the completion of the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated
herein, and Western fails to cure or cause the cure of such breach within

       | (B)  |   | Western is in breach of any of its
representations or warranties made in this Agreement (i) that are qualified
by a reference to Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that are not qualified by a

such representations and warranties shall be ignored) on the Western Parties
or, in either case, such breach materially impedes the completion of
the Arrangement, and Western fails to cure or cause the cure of such
breach within five Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof
from Purchaser (except that no cure period shall be provided for a breach
which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period
extend beyond the Outside Date); and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

     (b)  |   | If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and no Party shall have any further liability to perform its
obligations hereunder except as provided in Article 6, Section 4.4, Section
2.13, and Section 2.14 and each PartyÂ’s obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive such termination, and provided
that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything contained in this
Section 8.1(b) shall relieve any Party from any liability for any breach by
it of this Agreement, including from any inaccuracy in any of
its representations and warranties and any non-performance by it of its
covenants made herein, prior to the date of such termination.

GENERAL    

10.1 Binding Effect   

This Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   

10.2 Assignment   

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other Parties hereto.   

10.3 Public Communications   

Each of Purchaser and Western agree to consult with each other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements with respect
to this Agreement or the Arrangement or making any filing with any
Governmental Authority with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no Party shall issue any press release regarding the
Arrangement, this Agreement or any transaction relating to this Agreement
without first providing a draft of such press release to the other Party and
reasonable opportunity for comment; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall be subject to each PartyÂ’s overriding obligation to make any such
disclosure required in accordance with Applicable Laws. If such disclosure is
required and the other Party has not reviewed or commented on the disclosure,
the Party making such disclosure shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to give prior oral or written notice to the other Party, and if such
prior notice is not possible, to give such notice promptly following such
disclosure.   

10.4 Costs   

Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, all fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost or
expense, whether or not the Arrangement is completed.   

10.5 Severability   

If any one or more of the provisions or parts thereof contained in this
Agreement should be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the remaining provisions or parts thereof contained herein shall be
and shall be conclusively deemed to be severable therefrom and the validity,
legality or enforceability of such remaining provisions or parts thereof shall
not in any way be affected or impaired by the severance of the provisions or
parts thereof severed. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
fullest extent possible.   

10.6 Further Assurances   

Each Party hereto shall, from time to time and at all times hereafter, at the
request of the other Parties hereto, but without further consideration, do
all such further acts, and execute and deliver all such further documents and
instruments and provide all such further assurances as may be reasonably

of consideration which may be elected in exchange for the aggregate number of
Shares in respect of which such an election is made; provided however, for
calculation purposes only, each individual Common Share may be only exchanged
pursuant to Section 3.01(a) for either Cash Consideration or Marathon Share
Consideration and each individual Class A Share may only be exchanged
pursuant to Section 3.01(g) for any one of the Cash Consideration, the
Marathon Share Consideration or the Exchangeable Share Consideration.
The maximum amount of Cash Consideration to be paid to Shareholders pursuant
to Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(g) is $3,807,847,771. The minimum number
of Exchangeable Shares that may be elected by Shareholders pursuant to
Section 3.01(g) is zero. The maximum number of Exchangeable Shares that may
be elected by Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.01(g) is 29,400,000. The
maximum aggregate number of Marathon Shares and Exchangeable Shares that may
be issued to Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(g) is
34,300,000. In the event that:   

       | (a)  |   | the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that
would, but for this Section 3.03(a), be issued to Shareholders pursuant to
Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(g) exceeds $3,807,847,771, then the Cash
Consideration to be issued to any holder shall be determined by multiplying
the total amount of Cash Consideration otherwise issuable to such holder by a
fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of which
is $3,807,847,771 and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the
Cash Consideration otherwise issuable to all holders; and such holder shall
be deemed to have elected to receive Marathon Share Consideration for the
remainder of their Shares for which, but for this Section 3.03(a), such
holder would otherwise have received Cash Consideration;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares that
would, but for this Section 3.03(b) and Section 3.03(c), be issued to
Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.01(g) exceeds 29,400,000 Exchangeable
Shares, then the number of Exchangeable Shares to be issued to any holder,
subject to rounding in accordance with Section 5.06, shall be determined by
multiplying the total number of Exchangeable Shares otherwise issuable
to such holder by a fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of
which is 29,400,000 and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Exchangeable Shares otherwise issuable to all holders; and such holder shall
be deemed to have elected to receive Marathon Share Consideration for the
remainder of their Shares for which, but for this Section 3.03(b), such
holder would otherwise have received Exchangeable Shares; and  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (c)  |   | the aggregate number of Marathon Shares and
Exchangeable Shares that would, but for this Section 3.03(c), be issued to
Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(g) (including those
Marathon Shares which Shareholders are deemed to have elected to receive
pursuant to Section 3.03(b) above) exceeds 34,300,000 Marathon Shares and
Exchangeable Shares collectively, then the number of Marathon Shares
and Exchangeable Shares to be issued to any holder, subject to rounding in
accordance with Section 5.06, shall be determined by multiplying the total
number of Marathon Shares and Exchangeable Shares otherwise issuable to such
holder by a fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of which
is 34,300,000 and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Marathon Shares and Exchangeable Shares otherwise issuable to all holders;
and such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive Cash Consideration
for the remainder of their Shares for which, but for this Section 3.03(c),
such holder would otherwise have received Marathon Shares and
Exchangeable Shares.

Shareholders) immediately before the Effective Time:

pursuant to subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the ITA, as applicable (and the
analogous provisions of provincial income tax law) with respect to the
transfer by the holder of Class A Shares, as applicable, to AcquisitionCo by
providing two signed copies of the necessary election forms to Western within
120 days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the
number of shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for
the purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to the election forms
complying with the provisions of the ITA (or applicable provincial income tax
law), the forms will be signed by AcquisitionCo and returned to such former
holders of Class A Shares within 30 days after the receipt thereof by Western
for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial taxing
authority). AcquisitionCo and Western will not be responsible for the proper
completion of any election form and, except for the obligation of
AcquisitionCo and Western to so sign and return duly completed election forms
which are received by Western within 120 days of the Effective Date,
AcquisitionCo and Western will not be responsible for any taxes, interest or
penalties resulting from the failure by a former holder of Class A Shares to
properly complete or file the election forms in the form and manner and
within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial
legislation). In its sole discretion, AcquisitionCo and Western may choose to
sign and return an election form received by it more than 120 days following
the Effective Date, but AcquisitionCo and Western will have no obligation to
do so.   

3.06 Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Common Shares, Marathon Shares or Exchangeable Shares such
amounts as Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of federal, provincial,
territorial, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof
as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the
holder, Western, AcquisitionCo, Marathon and the Depositary are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such other portion of the
consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Western,
AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it
to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and Western,
AcquisitionCo, Marathon or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and
remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.   

ARTICLE IV    

DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS    

4.01 Each registered holder of Common Shares shall have the right to dissent
with respect to the Arrangement in accordance with the Interim Order. A
Dissenting Shareholder shall, on the Effective Date, cease to have any rights
as a holder of Common Shares and shall only be entitled to be paid the fair
value of the holderÂ’s Common Shares. A Dissenting Shareholder who is paid the
fair value of the holderÂ’s Common Shares shall be deemed to have transferred
the holderÂ’s Common Shares to Western for cancellation on the Effective Date,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. A Dissenting
Shareholder who for any reason is not entitled to be paid the fair value
of the holderÂ’s Common Shares shall be treated as if the holder had
participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder
of Common Shares and shall be deemed to have elected to receive for such
holderÂ’s Shares the consideration specified in Section 3.02(d),
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. The fair value of
the Common Shares shall be determined as of the close of business on the last
business day before the day on which the Arrangement is approved by the
holders of Common Shares at the Meeting; but in no event shall Western be
required to recognize such Dissenting Shareholder as a shareholder of Western
after the Effective Time and the names of such holders shall be removed from
the applicable register of shareholders as at the Effective Time. For greater
certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Section 191 of the ABCA,
any person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement shall not be entitled to
dissent with respect to the Arrangement.   

ARTICLE V    

OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SECURITIES    

5.01 From and after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing
Common Shares acquired by AcquisitionCo under the Arrangement shall represent
only the right to receive the consideration to which the holders are entitled
under the Arrangement, or as to those held by Dissenting Shareholders, other
than those Dissenting Shareholders deemed to have participated in
the Arrangement pursuant to Section 4.01, to receive the fair value of the
Common Shares represented by such certificates.   

5.02 Western, AcquisitionCo and SpinCo, as applicable, shall, as soon as
practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit
by a former holder of Common Shares acquired by AcquisitionCo under the
Arrangement of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form
and the certificates representing such Common Shares, either:   

       | (a)  |   | forward or cause to be forwarded by first class
mail (postage prepaid) to such former holder at the address specified in the
Letter of Transmittal and Election Form; or  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (b)  |   | if requested by such holder in the Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form, make available or cause to be made available
at the Depositary for pickup by such holder;  
---|---|---|--- 
     

the Cash Consideration and certificates representing the number of SpinCo
Shares, SpinCo Warrants, Marathon Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares, as
applicable, issued to such holder under the Arrangement.   

5.03 If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented an interest in outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged
pursuant to Section 3.01 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue and deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration to
which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement (and any dividends
with respect thereto) as determined in accordance with the Arrangement. The
person who is entitled to receive such consideration shall as a
condition precedent to the receipt thereof give a bond satisfactory to
Western and its transfer agent in such form as is satisfactory to Western and
such transfer agent or otherwise indemnify Western, Marathon and
AcquisitionCo and the transfer agent, to the reasonable satisfaction of such
parties, against any claim that may be made against any of them with respect
to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

5.04 All dividends payable with respect to any Marathon Shares, Exchangeable
Shares and SpinCo Shares allotted and issued pursuant to this Arrangement for
which a certificate has not been issued shall be paid or delivered to the
Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for the registered holder
thereof. All monies received by the Depositary shall be invested by it
in interest-bearing trust accounts upon such terms as the Depositary may
reasonably deem appropriate. The Depositary shall pay and deliver to any such
registered holder, as soon as reasonably practicable after application
therefor is made by the registered holder to the Depositary in such form as
the Depositary may reasonably require, such distributions and any interest
thereon to which such holder, is entitled, net of applicable withholding and
other taxes.   

5.05 Any certificate formerly representing Common Shares that is not deposited
with all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement on or before
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a right
or claim of any kind or nature and the right of the holder of such Common
Shares to receive the certificates representing: (i) the SpinCo Shares;
(ii) SpinCo Warrants; (iii) Marathon Shares; (iv) Exchangeable Shares; and/or
(v) cash.   

5.06 No certificates representing fractional Marathon Shares, Exchangeable
Shares, SpinCo Shares or SpinCo Warrants shall be issued upon the exchange of
the Common Shares for Marathon Shares or Exchangeable Shares or the
distribution of SpinCo Shares and SpinCo Warrants. In lieu of any fractional
Marathon Share, Exchangeable Share, SpinCo Share or SpinCo Warrant, each
registered Common Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in
a Marathon Share, Exchangeable Share, SpinCo Share or SpinCo Warrant will
receive the nearest whole number of Marathon Shares, Exchangeable Shares,
SpinCo Shares or SpinCo Warrants, as the case may be.   

ARTICLE VI    

AMENDMENTS    

6.01 Western, WesternZagros, Marathon and AcquisitionCo may amend, modify
and/or supplement this Plan of Arrangement at any time and from time to time
prior to the Effective Time, provided that each such amendment, modification
and/or supplement must be (i) set out in writing, (ii) approved by the other
parties, (iii) filed with the Court and, if made following the Meeting,
approved by the Court, and (iv) communicated to holders of Common Shares, if
and as required by the Court.   

6.02 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be proposed by Western, WesternZagros, Marathon or AcquisitionCo at any time
prior to or at the Meeting (provided that the other parties shall have
consented thereto) with or without any other prior notice or communication,
and if so proposed and accepted by the persons voting at the Meeting (other
than as may be required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this
Plan of Arrangement for all purposes.   

6.03 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement
that is approved by the Court following the Meeting shall be effective only
if it is consented to by each of Western, WesternZagros, Marathon and
AcquisitionCo.   

6.04 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be made following the Effective Time unilaterally by Western, provided that
it concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Western, is of an
administrative nature required to better give effect to the implementation of
this Plan of Arrangement and is not adverse to the financial or
economic interests of Western or any former holder of Common Shares.

APPENDIX A    

EXCHANGEABLE SHARES    

 _TERM SHEET_    

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
     

Designation: 

  |   | Exchangeable Shares (non-voting redeemable preferred 
 shares) of a direct or indirect Canadian subsidiary 
 ("Purchaser") of Marathon Oil Corporation ("Parent").  
  

Basic Right: 

  |   | Exchangeable at any time on a one-for-one basis directly 
 for freely-trading shares of common stock of Parent 
 ("Parent Shares"), subject to adjustment.  
  

Dividends: 

  |   | Dividends will be payable on the Exchangeable Shares, if, 
 as and when declared by the board of directors of 
 Purchaser.  
  

Parent Dividends: 

  |   | In the event, from time to time, a cash dividend is paid 
 on the Parent Shares, the dividend paid shall be 
 evidenced by the adjustment of the Exchangeable 
 Consideration (as defined below) in such a manner as to 
 provide that the number of Parent Shares for which the 
 Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable shall be increased 
 to account for the cash dividend declared on the Parent 
 Shares on an economically equivalent basis.  
  

Retraction: 

  |   | Each Exchangeable Share is retractable at any time at the 
 option of the holder for an amount equal to the fair 
 market value of one Parent Share on the retraction date, 
 subject to adjustment, payment of which amount shall be 
 satisfied by the delivery to the holder of one Parent 
 Share (the "Exchangeable Consideration"), subject to 
 adjustment and subject to an overriding retraction call 
 right exercisable by Parent and any of its direct and 
 indirect subsidiaries by delivery of the Exchangeable 
 Consideration in exchange for the retracted Exchangeable 
 Shares.  
  

Exchange Right: 

  |   | Parent shall grant a direct exchange right to a trustee 
 pursuant to the terms of a Voting and Exchange Trust 
 Agreement for the benefit of the holders of Exchangeable 
 Shares.

 entitles the holder to receive the Exchangeable 
 Consideration in priority to any distribution made to the 
 common shares of Purchaser and all other classes of 
 shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, subject 
 to a liquidation call right exercisable by Parent and any 
 of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. On exercise of 
 the liquidation call right, Parent will pay the holder 
 the Exchangeable Consideration. In addition, an 
 automatic exchange right in the event of liquidation of 
 Parent will be granted by Parent to a trustee for the 
 benefit of holders of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the 
 terms of the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  
  

Redemption:

 earlier redemption by the Purchaser in the following 
 limited circumstances: (a) less than 20% of the 
 Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding, (b) change of 
 Canadian tax laws enabling holders to defer taxable event 
 notwithstanding exchange of the Exchangeable Shares for 
 Parent Shares, (c) a Parent control transaction where it 
 is not reasonably practicable to accommodate the 
 Exchangeable Shares, and (d) the occurrence of certain 
 events which would otherwise entitle the holders of 
 Exchangeable Shares to vote as shareholders of Purchaser 
 where it is not reasonably practicable to accommodate the 
 Exchangeable Shares or where the holders of Exchangeable 
 Shares fail to take the necessary action to approve or 
 disapprove of the matter to be voted on by the holders of 
 Exchangeable Shares.  
  

Voting Rights: 

  |   | Holders of Exchangeable Shares will have equivalent 
 voting rights to holders of Parent Shares. These rights

 have no voting rights in Purchaser, except as required by 
 law in connection with certain extraordinary transactions 
 or fundamental changes to Purchaser.

  |   | Holders of Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to 
 receive substantially the same materials that are 
 distributed by Parent to holders of Parent Shares.  
  

Ranking: 

  |   | Exchangeable Shares rank in priority to the common shares 
 of Purchaser and all other classes of shares of Purchaser 
 ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares as to dividends 
 and any other distributions.  
  

Other:

 and Exchange Trust Agreement between Parent and the 
 trustee for the benefit of the holders of Exchangeable 
 Shares, each on terms and conditions customary for 
 transactions of this nature.
