vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Agreement_ ") dated as of April 30,
2007 is by and among TIBCO Software Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_
"), Thunderbolt Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and Spotfire Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and, together with Buyer and
Acquisition Sub, the " _Parties_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that (i) the
Merger (as defined below) is advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the Stockholders (as defined below) and (ii) the cash
consideration to be received for the outstanding shares of Common Stock (as
defined below) in the Merger is fair to the Stockholders;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Merger, the Board of Directors of each of the
Company, Buyer and Acquisition Sub have approved and declared advisable the
Merger in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as from time to time in effect (the " _DGCL_ "), and upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Stockholders that are listed on _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Specified Stockholders_ ") have entered into voting agreements reflecting
their approval and adoption of this Agreement (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ ")
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ ;

WHEREAS, the Specified Stockholders constitute the majorities required to
obtain the Statutory Stockholder Approval (as defined below); and

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration specified in
Section 2.6(c) and each share of the common stock of Acquisition Sub shall be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (as
defined below);

WHEREAS, prior to the Merger all shares of Preferred Stock will be converted
to Common Stock; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties,
and covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

The definitions contained in Appendix 1 are incorporated herein by reference. ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

2.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). At the Effective Time, the identity and separate existence
of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties and other interests
of the Company and of Acquisition Sub.

2.2. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended at the Effective Time as provided in Exhibit A to the Certificate
of Merger until amended as provided by Law and the bylaws of Acquisition Sub
in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until amended as provided by Law.

2.3. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall be
the directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and
all such directors shall hold office until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified. The officers of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time shall be determined by the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, to serve and hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.

2.4. _Conversion of Preferred Stock_. Immediately prior to the Closing, (i)
each outstanding share of Preferred Stock will be converted into one share of
Common Stock pursuant to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and (ii)
each Company Warrant exercisable for shares of Preferred Stock shall instead
be exercisable for the number of shares of Common Stock into which
such shares of Preferred Stock would be convertible pursuant to the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation if such shares of Preferred Stock were then
outstanding (the " _Conversion_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any other
action, event or reckoning occurring immediately prior to the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be
deemed to have occurred following the Conversion.

2.5. _Merger Consideration_.

(a) The total consideration payable to the Stockholders and holders of Company
Options and Company Warrants for the Merger shall equal $195.0 million (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). The total cash consideration to be delivered to
the Stockholders and holders of In-the-Money Company Vested Options or Company
Warrants shall equal the Merger Consideration _less_ an amount equal to any
negative  



 

2  Estimated Net Cash Balance and _minus_ the aggregate Allocated Consideration
with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to In-the-Money
Company Unvested Options (the " _Cash Consideration_ ").

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver by wire transfer an amount in cash
equal to (A) $29,250,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") _plus_ (B) $200,000 (the "
_Stockholder Representative Expense Amount_ ") to the Escrow Agent.

(i) The Escrow Amount shall be deemed to comprise a deposit with respect to
each holder of Common Stock, Company Vested Options or Company Warrants (each
such holder, a " _Depositor_ ") in the amounts set forth on _Schedule 2.5(b)_
, which shall equal for each Depositor (A) the Escrow Amount _multiplied_ by
(B) the aggregate Allocated Consideration with respect to each share of
Common Stock (other than Treasury Shares) held by such Depositor and each
share of Common Stock subject to In-the-Money Company Vested Options or In-
the-Money Company Warrants held by such Depositor _divided by_  (C) the
aggregate Allocated Consideration with respect to all shares of Common Stock
(other than Treasury Shares) and all shares of Common Stock subject to In-the-
Money Company Vested Options or In-the-Money Company Warrants.

(ii) The Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall be deemed to comprise
a deposit with respect to each Depositor in the amounts set forth on
_Schedule 2.5(b)_ , which amount shall be equal to (A) the Stockholder
Representative Expense Amount _multiplied by_ (B) the aggregate Allocated
Consideration with respect to each share of Common Stock (other than Treasury
Shares) held by such Depositor and each share of Common Stock subject to In-
the-Money Company Vested Options or In-the-Money Company Warrants held by such
Depositor _divided by_ (C) the aggregate Allocated Consideration with respect
to all shares of Common Stock (other than Treasury Shares) and all shares of
Common Stock subject to In-the-Money Company Vested Options or In-the-Money
Company Warrants.

(iii) Any payment from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Sections 9.7(a) or 9.7(c)
and any payment from the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall be
deemed to proportionately reduce the interest of each Depositor in such amount
based upon each Depositors respective interests in such amount. Any payment
from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 9.7(b) with respect to a Depositor
shall only reduce such Depositors interest in the Escrow Amount.

(iv) On the date which is nine months after the Closing Date (the " _First
Release Date"_ ), the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Stockholders and
holders of Company Vested Options and Company Warrants (in proportion to their
respective interests in the Escrow Account as of that date), a portion of the
Escrow Amount equal to (x) $19,500,000, _less_ (y) the aggregate amount of all
 



 

3  Demands for Payment (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) that have already
been paid or that are as of the First Release Date still unresolved. The
remaining funds in the Escrow Account shall be deemed the " _Escrow Amount_ "
at all times following the First Release Date for all purposes under this
Agreement.

(v) On the date which is eighteen months after the Closing Date (the " _Final
Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Stockholders and
holders of Company Vested Options and Company Warrants (in proportion to their
respective interests in the Escrow Account as of that date), the balance of
the Escrow Amount, subject to any then-unresolved Demands for Payment. Such
distribution shall be subject to and in accordance with the terms of, the
Escrow Agreement.

(vi) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Amount shall be
treated as an installment obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the Code,
and no Party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with such
characterization. The Parties further agree that, consistent with Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8 under the Code, for Tax reporting
purposes, all interest or other income earned from the investment of the
Escrow Amount or any portion thereof, in any Tax year shall be reported as
allocated to Buyer until the distribution of the Escrow Amount (or any portion
thereof) is determined, and thereafter to Buyer and the Depositors in
accordance with their respective interests in the Escrow Amount, consistent
with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8 under the Code. Promptly
following the end of each calendar year and the receipt of the certificate
below, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Buyer an amount equal to the
Effective Tax Rate multiplied by the taxable income and gains earned on the
Escrow Amount during such year (the " _Tax Distributions_ "). The "Effective
Tax Rate" shall mean a percentage equal to the combined federal and state tax
rate for Buyer for the relevant calendar year. The Effective Tax Rate and the
amount of any Tax Distribution shall be set forth in a certificate signed by
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative and delivered to the Escrow Agent.

(c) Buyer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, either (i) in trust with a
commercial bank or trust company appointed by Buyer and reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Agent_ ") or (ii) in a segregated back account of
Buyer, in either case for the benefit of the Stockholders and the holders of
In-the-Money Company Vested Options or In-the-Money Company Warrants, cash in
an aggregate amount equal to (A) the Cash Consideration _less_ (B) the Escrow
Amount _less_ (C) the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount (such amount
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The " _Paying
Agent_ " shall mean the Agent, in the event Buyer elects to deposit funds
pursuant to clause (i), and Buyer, otherwise. The Paying Agent shall act as
exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of
exchanging certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Common Stock for the  



 

4  applicable portion of the Exchange Fund and for the purpose of making the
payments set forth in Section 2.6(c) and Section 2.9, it being
understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the
Agent shall be turned over to Buyer. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement.

(d) _Schedule 2.5(b)_ contains a complete list of the Stockholders and all
holders of Company Vested Options and Company Warrants and, as to each such
Person with respect to the Common Stock, Company Vested Options and Company
Warrants held by such Person, sets forth (i) the amount of Cash Consideration
payable to each, (ii) the amount allocable with respect to the Exchange Fund,
(iii) the amount allocable with respect to the Escrow Amount and (iv) the
amount allocable with respect to the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund
Amount.

2.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders or the holders of any shares of
common stock of Acquisition Sub (" _Acquisition Sub Common Stock_ "): 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of Acquisition Sub Common Stock shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All Treasury Shares shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be payable in exchange
therefor.

(c) Each share of Common Stock (other than Treasury Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Price, payable as set forth in Section 2.5. Upon surrender of any
certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") representing shares of Common Stock in
the manner provided in Section 2.7, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive, at such time as any portion of the Cash Consideration shall become
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.7, such portion of the Cash
Consideration as shall be applicable to the shares of Common Stock represented
by such Certificate.

2.7. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereof), the Company, or, if applicable, the Paying Agent
pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates evidencing shares eligible
for conversion pursuant to Section 2.6(c): (i) a Letter of Transmittal
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates
in exchange for payment of a portion of the Cash Consideration. From and after
the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such Letter  



 

5  of Transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive the portion of the Cash Consideration
for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and extinguished.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7(a), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive a portion of the Cash Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 2.7(a), without interest, and shall not evidence any interest in, or
any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation. At or after the Closing, Buyer shall
pay, or cause the Paying Agent (subject to the terms of the Paying Agent
Agreement) to pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
applicable portion of the Cash Consideration to each holder of a Certificate
that has tendered such Certificate.

(b) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.7. 

(c) None of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Cash
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If Certificates are not
surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time, unclaimed Cash
Consideration payable with respect to the shares of the Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Buyer or
the Paying Agent may, in its or their discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the respective portion of the Cash Consideration, require
the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate to (i) provide an
appropriate affidavit, in which affidavit such owner indemnifies Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against them with
respect to such Certificate and (ii) deliver either a bond (in such sums as
the Paying Agent may reasonably direct) as indemnity or a Medallion signature
guarantee from a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the
Paying Agent. After the Effective Time and upon the making of such affidavit,
the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Cash Consideration with respect thereto.



 

6 2.8. _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect thereto
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive
a portion of the Cash Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its statutory right to appraisal.
From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares who has
properly exercised such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a
stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A
holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in which case such
Dissenting Shares shall be converted into and represent only the right to
receive a portion of the Cash Consideration, without interest, upon surrender
of the Certificate or Certificates formerly representing such Dissenting
Shares set forth in Section 2.6(c).

(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, the
Company may not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

2.9. _Company Options, Warrants and Rights_.

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Vested Option shall
be automatically cancelled and, in consideration of such cancellation, upon
receipt of an acknowledged Notice to Optionholder substantially in the form
attached as _Exhibit 2.9(a)(1)_ (" _Notice to Optionholder_ "), Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of In-the-Money Company Vested
Options (a) an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the
Allocated Consideration attributable to each such In-the-Money Company Vested
Option and (ii) the number of unexercised shares of Company Common Stock
subject thereto, _less_ (b)(i) an interest in the Escrow Account equal to
such holders share of the Escrow Amount with respect to such In-the-Money
Company Vested Options determined in accordance with Section 2.5(b)(i) and
(ii) such holders applicable Stockholder Representative Expense Amount with
respect to such In-the-Money Company Vested Options determined in accordance
with Section 2.5(b)(ii), and such withheld amounts shall be payable as set
forth in Section 2.5(b) and the Escrow Agreement. Each Company Unvested
Option shall be cancelled and, conditioned upon the execution of and subject
to the terms of a Substitute Stock Option Agreement by and  



 

7  between Buyer and the holder of such Company Unvested Option, substantially
in the form attached as _Exhibit 2.9(a)(2)_ hereto, substituted
therefor shall be an option (each, a " _Substitute Option_ ") to purchase
Buyers common stock, par value $0.001 per share, in a substitution that will
not be deemed a grant of a new option for purposes of the rules under Section
409A of the Code. _Schedule 2.9_ contains a list of all Company Unvested
Options and the number of shares of Buyers common stock subject to the
Substitute Option that will be substituted for each such Company Unvested
Option and the exercise price per share of Buyer common stock of such
Substitute Option. As of the Effective Time, the Option Plan shall terminate
and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to effectuate the foregoing, including, but not limited to,
amending the Option Plan as required, sending out the requisite notices and
obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and/or cancel all Company Options
to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no person shall have any right under
the Option Plan, except as set forth herein.

(b) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to
acquire shares of Common Stock, including for this purpose any Company
Warrant, shall no longer be exercisable for shares of Common Stock and will
instead become exercisable for the portion of the Merger Consideration that
would have been payable upon exchange of the Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration shall be payable to each holder
of a Company Warrant upon surrender of the original warrant certificate,
appropriate documentation (including a Warrant Termination Agreement in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.9(b)_ ) and payment of the applicable
exercise price in cash, if any, in immediately available funds.

2.10. _Estimated Net Cash Balances Adjustment_.

(a) _Estimated Net Cash Balance_. The Company, after consulting with Buyer
(and reasonably taking into account the views of Buyer regarding the subject),
will deliver to Buyer, not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, a statement, certified by each of the chief
financial officer and chief executive officer of Company, that will set forth
their good faith estimate of the Net Cash Balance of the Company as of the
close of business on the anticipated Closing Date, after giving effect to the
Merger (the " _Estimated Net Cash Balance_ "), determined in accordance with
GAAP as in effect on the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date. 

(b) _Closing Balance Sheet_. As promptly as possible and in any event within
forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare or cause to
be prepared, and will provide to the Stockholder Representative, a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a written statement setting forth
in reasonable detail its determination of the Net Cash Balance on  



 

8  the Closing Date as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Cash
Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet and the Cash Statement will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of the Most
Recent Balance Sheet Date. The Stockholder Representative will have reasonable
access to the work papers used by Buyer in the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Cash Statement.

(c) _Dispute Notice_. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Cash Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Stockholder
Representative provides a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer no
later than the twentieth day after delivery of the Cash Statement setting
forth in reasonable detail (a) any item on the Closing Balance Sheet and/or
the Cash Statement which the Stockholder Representative believes has not been
prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of the Most Recent
Balance Sheet Date and (b) the correct amount of such item in accordance with
GAAP as in effect on the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date. Any item
or amount to which no dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. 

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_. The Buyer and the Stockholder Representative
will attempt to resolve the matters raised in a Dispute Notice in good faith.
Five (5) Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either Buyer or
the Stockholder Representative may provide written notice to the other that it
elects to submit the disputed items to BDO Seidman, LLP, or another
nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen jointly by Buyer and
Stockholder Representative (the " _Referee_ "). The Referee will promptly, in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, review only those items and amounts specifically set forth and
objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each
such specific item and amount in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date
of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date. The fees and expenses of the Referee
will be shared equally by the Stockholders and Buyer, and the decision of the
Referee with respect to the items of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Cash
Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. Each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Referee and to cause the Referee to resolve any dispute
no later than thirty (30) Business Days after selection of the Referee.

(e) _Consideration Adjustment_. Promptly, and in any event no later than the
fifth Business Day after final determination of the actual Net Cash Balance
in accordance with this Section 2.10, if:

(i) the actual Net Cash Balance amount determined pursuant to this Section
2.10 is less than the Estimated Net Cash Balance prepared prior to Closing,
then, to the extent the Net Cash Balance is less than zero, an amount equal to
the lesser of (x) the amount by which such shortfall is less than zero and
(y) the amount of such shortfall, will be paid to the Surviving Corporation by
wire transfer of immediately available funds out of the Escrow Amount;
provided that  



 

9  such payment shall not reduce the Escrow Amount for purposes of Article IX
(that is, to the extent the Escrow Amount is exhausted for any reason prior
to final release of the Escrow, any amount payable pursuant to this Section
2.10 shall be payable directly by the Stockholders); and

(ii) the actual Net Cash Balance amount determined pursuant to this Section
2.10 is greater than the Estimated Net Cash Balance prepared prior to Closing,
_and_ there was a negative Estimated Net Cash Balance which caused a decrease
in the Cash Consideration at Closing, then an amount equal to the lesser of
(x) the amount by which the Cash Consideration was decreased at Closing for
the Estimated Net Cash Balance, and (y) such difference, shall be deposited
with the Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Amount, and shall be released upon
release of the Escrow Amount and shall be deemed to comprise a deposit with
respect to each Depositor in proportion to their respective initial deposits
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i).

For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(e)
shall not be subject to any limitations set forth in Article IX including,
without limitation, any Indemnification Threshold.

2.11. _FIRPTA_. On or before the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer
a certification (in such form as may be reasonably requested by Buyer)
conforming to the requirements of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3)
and 1.897-2(h). In addition, simultaneously with delivery of such
certificate, the Company shall provide to Buyer, as agent for the Company, a
form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.897-2(h)(2) (in substantially
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.11_ ) along with written authorization
for Buyer to deliver such notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on
behalf of the Company following the Closing.

2.12. _Withholding_. Each of Buyer, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold Taxes from any amounts payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, if such withholding is
required under the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of any other
applicable Law, and to pay such Taxes to the appropriate Tax Authority. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate
Tax Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

2.13. _Transfer Taxes_. If payment of the portion of the Cash Consideration
payable to a holder of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is to be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a
person other than the  



 

10  registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established
to the satisfaction of Buyer that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. The Stockholders will be liable for all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any
conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in connection with the Merger.
The Stockholder Representative will file or cause to be filed all necessary
Tax Returns relating to such Taxes to the extent such Tax Returns are an
obligation of the Stockholders under applicable law, and shall give to Buyer a
copy of any such Tax Returns as filed, together with proof of payment of the
Tax shown thereon, promptly after filing. The Buyer will file or cause to be
filed all necessary Tax Returns relating to such Taxes to the extent such Tax
Returns are an obligation of Buyer under applicable law, and shall give to
the Stockholder Representative a copy of any such Tax Returns as filed,
together with proof of payment of the Tax shown thereon, promptly after
filing. The Parties hereto will cooperate with each other to make any such
necessary filings and, to the extent reasonably required and legally
permitted, to minimize any such Taxes.

2.14. _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other acts or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in or to any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or Acquisition Sub or otherwise to

and all right, title or interest in, to or under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

2.15. _Escrow Agreement_. On the Closing Date, Buyer, the Stockholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement
and Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount and the Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount into escrow, with each such amount to be released on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

2.16. _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray
LLP, One International Place, Boston, Massachusetts, on the latest of (a) the
second Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have
been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than the
delivery of items at the Closing and other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the
occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items
and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or (b) at such other place
and time as the Parties may mutually determine in writing (the " _Closing
Date_ ").

2.17. _Deliveries at the Closing_. At the Closing, (a) the Company will

to in Section 7.1, (b) the  



 

11  Paying Agent will make the payments contemplated by this Agreement to be

(a) Effective upon the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Stockholders, and without any further act of any Stockholder, Christopher
Ahlberg shall be constituted and appointed as the representative of the
Stockholders (the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") for and on behalf of the
Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, take any actions
contemplated by Section 2.14, to authorize delivery to Buyer or any other
Buyer Indemnified Person of any amounts from the funds held by the Escrow

and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholder Representative
will serve without compensation unless otherwise agreed in a separate
agreement among the Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative.

shall constitute a decision of all of the Stockholders, and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each and every Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent
and Buyer may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Buyer are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such

Indemnified Party will promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party

(b) _Assumption of Defense, etc._ The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.4(a). In addition,

against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (a) the Indemnifying Party
gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim, (b) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified
Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the

Intellectual Property, or any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (f)
settlement of, an adverse judgment with respect to or the Indemnifying

faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to be adverse to the
Indemnified Partys reputation or continuing business interests (including
its relationships with current or potential customers, suppliers or other
parties material to the conduct of its business) and (g) the Indemnifying
Party conducts  



 

56  the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently. The

and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Section 9\.

(c)  _Limitations on Indemnifying Party_. The Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party unless such judgment, compromise or
settlement (a) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as
sole relief for the claimant, (b) results in the full and general release of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons or Stockholder Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection
with, the Third Party Claim and (c) involves no finding or admission of any
violation of Legal Requirements or the rights of any Person and no effect on
any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party.

(d) _Indemnified Party s Control_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the notice contemplated by clause (a), or the evidence contemplated by
clause (b), of Section (b) within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim, or otherwise at any time
fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently,
the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need
not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
will not be bound by the entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such
compromise or settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If such notice
and evidence is given on a timely basis and the Indemnifying Party conducts
the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently but any of the
other conditions in Section (b) is or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified
Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the
entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement
effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that the Indemnified Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section
9.4(d), the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party will (a) advance the Indemnified

caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section

Party pursuant to this Agreement in connection with such Third Party Claim,
and in furtherance thereof, the provisions of Section 12.14 are incorporated
herein by reference, mutatis mutandis.

9.6. _No Circular Recovery_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees that it will not
make any claim for indemnification against Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or the Company by reason of the fact that such Stockholder was a controlling
person, director, employee or Representative of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or was serving as such for another Person at the request of Buyer
or the Company (whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, organizational document,
contractual obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a
Buyer Indemnified Person against any Stockholder relating to this Agreement.
With respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against any
Stockholder relating to this Agreement, each Stockholder expressly waives any
right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other
claim against the Company with respect to any amounts owed by such Stockholder
pursuant to this Article IX.

9.7. _Source for and Limitations to Indemnification by Company and
Stockholders_. Except as set forth in this Section 9.7, for as long as there
are funds in the account maintained under the Escrow Agreement, any and all
amounts payable by the Stockholders (or any of them) as Indemnifying Parties
to a Buyer Indemnified Person will be paid (except to the extent Buyer has a
right in this Section 9.7 to pursue a Stockholder directly) in cash first out
of the Escrow Amount, and thereafter by the Stockholders in accordance with
payment instructions provided by Buyer.

(a) Each Stockholder shall severally and not jointly indemnify and hold the
Buyer Indemnified Persons harmless from, against and in respect of any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons as a result of,

inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by the Company in Sections
3.1 (Organization and Authority), 3.2 (Capitalization and Ownership), 3.4
(Authorization of Transaction), 3.6 (Brokers), 3.15 (Taxes) or 3.24
(Environmental) or (b) claims pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a Stockholder which is covered in
Section 9.7(b)), 9.1(a)(v) or 9.1(a)(vi); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this
Section 9.7(a) applies only to the extent that the Escrow Account does not
contain sufficient funds to cover all such Losses and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in no event shall any Stockholders Liability for such Losses exceed the
lesser of (x) the Cash Consideration actually received by such Stockholder or
(y) such Stockholders pro rata share of such Losses based on the ratio of (1)
such Stockholders aggregate portion of the Cash Consideration to (2) the
Cash Consideration.



 

58 (b) Each Stockholder shall severally and not jointly indemnify and hold the
Buyer Indemnified Persons harmless from, against and in respect of any and
all Losses for which a Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iv) or for fraud or intentional misrepresentation
by such Stockholder pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) shall, at the option of
Buyer, be satisfied either (i) from the Escrow Account or (ii) in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by the breaching Stockholder, as
applicable, and not from the Escrow Account; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall any Stockholders Liability for such Losses exceed the Cash
Consideration actually received by such Stockholder.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 9.7(a) and (b), the Escrow Account is the
sole and exclusive source of indemnification from which a Buyer Indemnified
Person may collect any Losses which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article IX and the Escrow Amount shall be the limit on claims made
pursuant to this Agreement. For all amounts in excess of the Escrow
Amount that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons directly from
the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 9.7, each Stockholders Liability
hereunder shall not exceed the Cash Consideration actually received by such
Stockholder. 

9.8. _Knowledge and Investigation_. The right of any Buyer Indemnified Person
or Stockholder Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this Article
IX will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance
with any covenant or agreement, referred to in Sections 9.1 and 9.2. The
waiver of any condition contained in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement based on the breach of any such representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or
agreement, will not affect the right of any Buyer Indemnified Person or
Stockholder Indemnified Person to indemnification pursuant to this Section
9.8 based on such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

9.9. _Remedies Cumulative_. The rights of each Buyer Indemnified Person and
Stockholder Indemnified Person under this Article IX are cumulative, and each
Buyer Indemnified Person and Stockholder Indemnified Person, as the case may
be, will have the right in any particular circumstance, in its sole
discretion, to enforce any provision of this Section 9 without regard to the
availability of a remedy under any other provision of this Section 9\. The
rights of Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Person under this Section 9 shall
be cumulative with any rights contained in the Escrow Agreement.

9.10. _Exclusivity_. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of
law or as provided in Section 12.13, if the Closing occurs, indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX will be the exclusive remedy for any breach of
this Agreement (including any representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement contained in this Agreement), other than in respect of claims based
on conduct constituting fraud, fraud in the inducement, intentional
misrepresentation or claims for equitable relief based on breaches of Section
2.14 or Article VIII.



 

59 9.11. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payments made to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by law.

which the Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to this Article IX, the

by the Company, Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Stockholder Representative. No
waiver by any party hereto of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not,

incurred by Buyer or the Company in connection with the Merger (which shall

12.12. _Construction_.

(a) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

(b) Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.



 

64 (c) The word "including" shall mean including without limitation.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Disclosure Schedule and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify
and limit the representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement and
shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any such
representations, warranties or covenants or modify the
indemnification provisions of the Agreement; (B) no reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule; (C) no disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or
regulation shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred; and (D) unless otherwise
noted, copies of all agreements specifically referenced in the Disclosure
Schedule have been made available to Buyer.

(e) Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an
exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure
Schedule describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail sufficient to put
the other Party on notice of the relevant matter or claim. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception
to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or
warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a particular schedule relating to one Section
of the Agreement may cross-reference matter(s) disclosed in any other schedule
relating to any other Section of the Agreement, and the cross-reference within
one part to any such matter shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into
the other schedule such matter fully as if set forth in its entirety in such
other schedule;

(f) The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in
any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, or covenant.

12.13. _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

12.14. _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or



 

65  injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter in addition to any other
remedy (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 12.16 below) to which
it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

12.15. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue_.

(a) This Agreement, and any claims arising hereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York. 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of New York sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court thereof in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it or he may effectively do
so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding. Each of the Parties also irrevocably and unconditionally consents
to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies of such process by certified mail to such Party and its
counsel at their respective addresses specified in Section 12.8. Each of the
Parties further irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding (after exhaustion of all appeals or
expiration of the time for appeal) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.
