ARTICLE 2  THE TRANSACTION   Section 2.01. THE SPIN-OFF. Provided that all
conditions precedent to the Spin-Off set forth in the Distribution Agreement
have been satisfied, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause each
Person that is intended to be a party to any Transaction Agreement (other
than the Merger Agreement) to enter into each such Transaction Agreement,
and, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Transaction
Agreements, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
effect, and cause Spinco to effect, the Spin-Off.   Section 2.02. THE
MERGER.   (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with
and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law and Georgia Law,
whereupon the separate exis-    -6-      tence of Merger Subsidiary
shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").   (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction
or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the
Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary will file a certificate of merger
with each of the Delaware Secretary of State and the Georgia Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law and
Georgia Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificates of merger are duly
filed with the Georgia Secretary of State and Delaware Secretary of State or
at such later time as is specified in the certificates of merger provided
that the Effective Time shall not occur unless and until the Spin-Off shall
have occurred.   (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises
and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and
disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Georgia Law.   Section 2.03. CONVERSION OF SHARES.    (a) At the
Effective Time:   (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(a)(ii) or
Section  2.05, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other  than any Shares that are Share Equivalents, together with the
associated  Right, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to (1)  $42.00 multiplied by 46,197,466, divided by (2) the number of
Shares issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, less
(3) the Per  Share Adjustment Amount, in cash per share, without interest
(the "Merger  Consideration");   (ii) each Share held by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time  shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto; and   (iii) each share of common stock of Merger
Subsidiary outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become  one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation with the same  rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving  Corporation.   (b) The Merger and the Spin-Off shall be
effected such that the shares of Spinco to be distributed in the Spin-Off and
the Merger Consideration are distributed or paid, as the case may be, only to
the same holders of Shares provided that the Spin-Off shall occur prior to
the Merger.   Section 2.04. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging
certificates repre-     7      senting Shares (the "Certificates")
for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i).
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Shares at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in
such exchange.   (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i)
will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, and
all other documents the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the Merger
Consideration payable for each Share represented by such Certificate. Until
so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2.   (c) If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and there shall be no
further registration or transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   (e) Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares three years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property
of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.     -8-       (f) Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
2.04(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been requested
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.   Section 2.05. DISSENTING SHARES.
Notwithstanding Section 2.03, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Georgia Law shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares. Except as required by applicable Law or with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. The exercise
of appraisal rights under Georgia Law whether or not perfected shall not
affect any holder\'s right to receive a pro-rata share of the Spin-Off.  
Section 2.06. EQUITY COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS; SHARE EQUIVALENTS.   (a) At
or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Share Equivalent outstanding
under any stock option or equity compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be canceled, and
the Company shall pay each holder of any such Share Equivalent which shall
have been granted or issued under the 1989 Executive Stock Incentive Plan at
or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Share Equivalent an amount
in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Change in
Control Price (as defined in the 1989 Executive Stock Incentive Plan) per
Share over the applicable exercise price of such Share Equivalent, if any, by
(ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full
vesting of all Share Equivalents) had such holder exercised or converted such
Share Equivalent into Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (b)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) obtain any consents from
holders of Share Equivalents granted under the Company\'s stock option
or equity compensation plans or arrangements and (ii) make any amendments to
the terms of such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that, in
the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), the Company deems reasonably
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 2.06(a).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, payment may be withheld
in respect of any such plans or arrangements until such necessary consents
are obtained, and the Company shall withhold from such payments all amounts
required by applicable Law or regulation to be withheld for taxes or
otherwise.   Section 2.07. ADJUSTMENTS. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
Shares shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
Shares, or stock dividend thereon (but excluding the Spin-Off) with a record
date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to Section    -9-      2.06 shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   Section 2.08.
WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.   Section 2.09. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen

to the income statements, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) as of the
beginning of the period presented. Such statements are based on, and should
be read in conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements
included in the Company SEC Documents. Such balance sheet fairly presents in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
ELF as of its date, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) on such date, and
each such consolidated statement of income fairly presents in all material
respects the results of operations of the Company and ELF for the periods set
forth therein, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) as of the beginning
of such period (subject to notes and normal year-end adjustments that are not
expected to be material in amount). The accounts reflected in the unaudited

prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the historical
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Spinco and its Subsidiaries) and were prepared in accordance with

amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof together with the most
recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto)
and actuarial valuation report prepared in connection with any such Employee
Plan. Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each such
Employee Plan that is (i) a Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a Title IV Plan or (iii)
maintained in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.   (b) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received from the IRS a favorable
determination letter stating that the Employee Plan is so qualified; the
Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would jeopardize the
qualified status of the Employee Plan if not cured; each trust created under
any Employee Plan has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from tax under
Section 501(a) of the Code as of and since its creation. The Company has made
available to Parent the most recent determination letter of the Internal
Revenue Service relating to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has
been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA and the Code.   (c) Section 4.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule includes the name of, and the Company has made
available to Parent copies or descriptions of, each Benefit Arrangement (and,
if applicable, related trust agreements) and all amendments thereto and
summary plan descriptions thereof, if applicable. Each such Benefit
Arrangement has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders,
rules and regulations and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable regulatory authorities.   (d) There has been no failure of
a group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet
the requirements of Code Sections 4980B(f), 9801 or 9802 with respect to a
qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section 4980B(g)) or other individual.
Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a
nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(c)) and neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of    -20-      the Company has
incurred a tax under Section 5000(a) that is or could become a liability of
the Company.   (e) No Title IV Plan has or has incurred an accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section
302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the
IRS with respect to any Title IV Plan, nor has any lien in favor of any Title
IV Plan arisen under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of
ERISA.   (f) There does not now exist, nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, do
any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability
that would be a liability of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
following the Effective Time. None of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.
With respect to each Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, none of the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates has received any notification, nor has
reasonable cause to believe, that any such Employee Plan is in
reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be
expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated. If
the Company and its ERISA Affiliates were to experience a complete withdrawal
from all such Multiemployer Plans, the total withdrawal liability would not
exceed the amount set forth in Section 4.16(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Transaction, will not result in partial or complete withdrawal from any such
Multiemployer Plan.   (g) All material contributions required to be made to
any Employee Arrangement or any trust or other arrangement funding any
Employee Arrangement by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document
or other contractual undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable
with respect to insurance policies funding any Employee Arrangement, for any
period have been timely made or paid in full.   (h) With respect to each
Employee Plan that is a Title IV Plan: (i) no reportable event within the
meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived and for which a prior notice requirement exists has
occurred, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Transaction, will not result in the occurrence of
any such reportable event; (ii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") have been timely paid in full; (iii) no material
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates; (iv) the unfunded current liability of each such Employee
Plan does not exceed the amount set forth in Section 4.16(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule for such Plan, based on the assumptions used for the most
recent actuarial valuation of such Plans, a copy of which has been made
available to Parent; and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such Employee Plan and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no
condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
Employee Plan.   (i) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i) an
accurate and complete list of each material Employee Arrangement under which
the execution and delivery of this     -21-      Agreement or the
Transaction Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Transaction, could (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event such as termination of employment) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries could be liable, or would limit the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any material Employee Arrangement or related trust; (ii) the
aggregate liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
bonuses and other incentive compensation in connection with or as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Transaction, (iii) the aggregate liabilities of the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, together with any corresponding assets held in any grantor trust
of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, pursuant to each Employee
Arrangement (other than Employee Plans that are qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code) providing any supplemental or excess retirement benefits
or other deferred compensation (whether elective or non-elective), in each
case determined as of the date set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (iv) the estimated maximum amount of the "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could become payable by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Transaction. No
outstanding options to purchase Shares granted to any current or former
employee or director of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates contain
any provision that would entitle the holder to receive any cash payment with
respect thereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby except as provided for in Section 2.06 hereof.   (j)
There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in
the ordinary course), investigations, lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no set
of circumstances exists which may give rise to a claim or lawsuits, against
the Employee Arrangements, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to such Employee Arrangements or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of such Employee Arrangements which could result in any liability of the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to the PBGC, the Department of
Treasury, the Department of Labor, or any other U.S. or foreign governmental
authority, or to any of such Employee Arrangements, any participant in any
such Employee Arrangement, or any other party. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has any actual or contingent liability under any such Employee
Arrangement or under any applicable Law or regulation for pay or benefits
incurred as a result of corporate restructuring, downsizing, layoffs or
similar events that has not been fully satisfied or adequately reserved for
in the audited consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes) and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents.   Section 4.17.

that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and there were no conditions or
Releases of Hazardous Substance in, on, under or affecting any currently or
previously owned or leased properties that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.   (e) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, or as set
forth in Section 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in each case has received from any Governmental Entity or
other third party any written (or, to the knowledge of the Company, other)
notice that the Company or its predecessors is or may be a potentially
responsible party in respect of or may otherwise bear liability for any
actual or threatened Release of Hazardous Substance at any site or facility
that is, has been or would be listed on the National Priorities List, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information
System or any similar or analogous federal, state, provincial, territorial,
municipal, county, local or other domestic or foreign list, schedule,
inventory or database of Hazardous Substance sites or facilities, except
where such notice or the circumstances referred to therein would not,
individually or in aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 4.18. ANTITAKEOVER STATUTE AND
RIGHTS AGREEMENT.   (a) No "fair price," "interested shareholder," "business
combination," or similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under
Georgia or other Law applicable to the Company is applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger and the Transaction Agreements.   
-23-       (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has approved an
amendment to the Rights Agreement which is, and at the Effective Time shall
be, effective, and has taken all other action necessary to render the Rights
inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

Rights Agreement in effect as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including a copy of such amendment.   Section 4.19. INSURANCE.
Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list in all material respects of all policies of directors\' and

effective insurance policies issued in favor of the Company or Spinco or
Spinco\'s Subsidiaries, respectively, that are customary and appropriate
under the circumstances. All such policies are in full force and effect, all
premiums due thereon have been paid, and the Company has complied with the
provisions of such policies.   Section 4.20. CERTAIN CONTRACTS;

unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the Company and ELF as of

termination of all contracts, arrangements and understandings between the
Company on the one hand and Spinco and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, to
the extent contemplated by the Distribution Agreement would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The

assets of the Company principally used in the business of the Company as of
July 15, 2000, other than assets or properties of the Company that will be

been obtained but reflects withdrawal liability as of a date earlier than

and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain
a current withdrawal liability statement from such Employee Plan and provide
it to Parent.   Section 6.04. NO SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company shall

constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which Takeover
Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.04, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms not
more favorable to such person than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided
that all such information is provided on a prior or substantially concurrent
basis to Parent, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal, provided that the Company shall have delivered to Parent
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to participate in such
discussions or negotiations. The Company will immediately cease all existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the return of
all confidential information regarding the Company and ELF provided to any
such parties prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of any
confidentiality agreements or otherwise.   The term "Takeover Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that is
reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in
one    -30-      transaction or a series of transactions, including
any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, binding share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
joint venture, purchase or similar transaction, of (A) assets or businesses
that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue, operating
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company\'s common stock or
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding the assets or
businesses referred to in clause (A) above or (C) any or all of the
ELF Shares.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Subsidiary) or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary) the recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this
Agreement or the Merger, provided, that in the event that prior to the
approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company receives a Superior Proposal (as determined in
accordance with Section 6.04(b)) that is unsolicited and did not result from
a breach of Section 6.04(a), the Board of Directors of the Company may, if it
believes in good faith such action is required under Georgia law to avoid a
breach of its fiduciary duties, after receipt of advice from its outside
legal counsel, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary the recommendation or declaration of advisability of this
Agreement or the Merger (each such action being referred to herein as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) adopt or approve, or recommend or
propose publicly to adopt or approve, or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or
withdraw its approval of the Merger, or propose publicly to withdraw its
approval of the Merger, (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.04(a)) or (iv) agree or
resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
of this sentence; and provided, however, that the Company shall not exercise
its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth
Business Day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal and specifying the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and identifying the Person
making such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day
period). Any such Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval
by the Board of Directors of the Company of the Merger and this Agreement
under Georgia law or for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger. The Company shall submit this Agreement to
its shareholders at a duly held meeting of shareholders even if the Board
of Directors of the Company shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change. Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall (x) permit the Company to
terminate this Agreement, (y) permit the Company to enter into any agreement
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (z) affect any other obligation of
the Company under this Agreement.    -31-       The term "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide binding written offer not solicited by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by a third party that,
if consummated, would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct
merger between such third party and the Company, the shareholders of such
third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, (i) more than 50% of the
voting power of the Company\'s common stock, (ii) all or substantially all
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) all or substantially
all of the ELF Shares, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial
point of view to the shareholders of the Company, taking into account, among
other things, any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise.   (c) In addition to the
obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 6.04, the Company promptly shall advise Parent in writing of any
request for information that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or
contemplates a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal together with a
copy of such Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably
believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in
this Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or (ii) making a disclosure to
the Company\'s shareholders if outside legal counsel advises that failure so
to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section
6.04(b)(i) or 6.04(b)(ii).   Section 6.05. THIRD PARTY STANDSTILL
AGREEMENTS. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement relating to the making of a Takeover Proposal to which
it is a party (other than any involving Parent or its Subsidiaries). During
such period, the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to enforce, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreements, including seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.  
Section 6.06. RIGHTS AGREEMENTS. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all further action (in addition to that referred to in
Section 4.18(b))reasonably requested in writing by Parent in order to render
the Rights inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Except as provided with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (a) amend the
Rights Agreement or (b) take any action with respect to, or make any
determinations under, the Rights Agreement, including a redemption of the
Rights or any action to facilitate a Takeover Proposal.    
-32-       Section 6.07. SPIN-OFF.   (a) The Company shall use its
best efforts to satisfy the conditions to the Spin-Off set forth in Section
3.02 of the Distribution Agreement and shall effect the Spin-Off if such
conditions have been satisfied. The Company shall cause Spinco to comply with
its obligations under the Distribution Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 6.07 to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that
this Section 6.07 shall not require the Company or Spinco, to waive any
condition to the Spin-Off set forth in Section 3.02 of the Distribution
Agreement. At or prior to the Spin-Off, the Company shall take those actions
required by Section 3.02 of the Distribution Agreement to be taken at or
prior to the Spin-Off.   (b) The Company shall keep Parent informed on a
regular basis concerning the developments in the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements and the means by which such transactions are
effected and, subject to any existing agreements as to the means of effecting
the transactions that are reflected in the Distribution Agreement, the
Company shall give reasonable consideration to Parent\'s views on the means
by which such transactions are effected.    ARTICLE 7  COVENANTS OF
PARENT   Parent agrees that:   Section 7.01. OBLIGATIONS OF MERGER
SUBSIDIARY. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   Section 7.02. DIRECTOR
AND OFFICER LIABILITY. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:   (a) For six
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless each present officer and director of the Company (each an
"Indemnified Person") to the fullest extent permitted by Georgia Law or any
other applicable laws or provided under the Company\'s articles
of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof in respect of its
decision to vote for the approval of the ELF Merger and the implementation of
such decision, provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law.   (b) The
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to control the defense of any action,
suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person and the Indemnified Person
shall cooperate in the defense thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for the fees, costs or expenses of any other counsel for an
Indemnified Person, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest
shall be caused thereby in which case the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
fees, costs and expenses of one additional counsel of the Indemnified
Person\'s choosing but reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation,
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for (i) the fees
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons or (ii) any settlement
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).    -33-       (c) For six years after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall provide officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the
Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided if the aggregate annual
premiums for such insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 200%
of the per annum rate of premium and brokerage costs paid by the Company as
of the date hereof for such insurance, then the Surviving Corporation shall
provide only such coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium
equal to 200% of such rate.   (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.02.   (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Georgia Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company. These rights shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.   (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
7.02 to the contrary, to the extent any obligation is also a Spinco Group
Liability (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) such matter shall be
addressed as a Spinco Group Liability pursuant to the Distribution Agreement
rather than this Section 7.02. In the event of a conflict between the
Distribution Agreement and this Section 7.02 with respect to the subject
matter of Section 7.02(a), this Section 7.02 shall govern.    ARTICLE 8

assets pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably requested, provided
that no obligation of the Company under any such agreement, pledge, or grant
shall be effective until the Effective Time; provided, that, all expenses,
liabilities or costs of the Company incurred in connection herewith shall be
the responsibility of Parent and any obligations entered into in connection
herewith are terminated in the event this Agreement is terminated in
