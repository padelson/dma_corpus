AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of November 20,
2000, by and among Finisar Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Finisar"),
Onyx Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Finisar ("Sub"), and Demeter Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Demeter").   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Finisar, Sub
and Demeter deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation
and its respective stockholders that Finisar and Demeter combine in order to
advance the long-term business interests of Finisar and Demeter;   WHEREAS,
the combination of Finisar and Demeter shall be effected by the terms of this
Agreement through a transaction (the "Merger") in which Sub will merge with
and into Demeter, Demeter will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Finisar
and the stockholders of Demeter will become stockholders of Finisar;  
WHEREAS, the terms of the Merger have been approved by the requisite vote of
the stockholders of Demeter; and   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes,
it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
below, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section
1.1 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form
as is required by the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the "DGCL") shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by the
Surviving Corporation and thereafter delivered to the Delaware Secretary of
State for filing, as provided in the DGCL, as soon as practicable on or
after the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.2). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State (the "Effective Time").   Section 1.2 CLOSING. The
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 1:00 p.m., Pacific
Time, on a date to be specified by Finisar and Demeter (the "Closing Date"),
which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(b)
(other than the delivery of the officers\' certificate   1   referred to
therein) and 7.3(b) (other than the delivery of the officers\' certificate
referred to therein), provided that the other closing conditions set forth in
Article VII have been met or waived as provided in Article VII at or prior to
the Closing, at the offices of Gray Cary Ware and Freidenrich LLP, 400 Hamilton
Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301 unless another date or place is agreed to in
writing by Finisar and Demeter.   Section 1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.   (a)
At the Effective Time (i) the separate existence of Sub shall cease, and Sub
shall be merged with and into Demeter (the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the
Certificate of Incorporation of Demeter shall be amended so that Article
Fourth of such Certificate of Incorporation shall read in its entirety as
follows: "The total number of shares of all classes which this corporation
shall have authority to issue shall be 1,000, all of which shall consist of
Common Stock having a par value of $0.001 per share" and, as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
(Sub and Demeter are sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent
Corporations.")   (b) At and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of a public as well as of a private nature, and be subject to all
the restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Constituent
Corporations; and all and singular rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of each of the Constituent Corporations, and all property, real, personal and
mixed, and all debts due to either of the Constituent Corporations on
whatever account, as well as for stock subscriptions and all other things in
action or belonging to each of the Constituent Corporations, shall be vested
in the Surviving Corporation, and all property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of the Surviving Corporation as they were of the
Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real estate vested by deed,
lease or otherwise, in either of the Constituent Corporations, shall not
revert or be in any way impaired but all rights of creditors and all liens
upon any property of either of the Constituent Corporations shall be
preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Constituent Corporations shall thereafter attach to the
Surviving Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as
if such debts and liabilities had been incurred by it.   Section 1.4
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the persons identified on SCHEDULE 1.4 hereto, each of
whom will hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF
SECURITIES   Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any shares of capital stock of Demeter or capital stock of Sub:  
2    (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of the
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND FINISAR-
OWNED STOCK. Any shares of Demeter capital stock that are owned by Demeter as
treasury stock and any shares that are owned by Finisar, Sub or any other
wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 10.2) of Finisar shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Finisar or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of
Common Stock, $.001 par value, of Finisar ("Finisar Common Stock") owned by
Demeter shall remain unaffected by the Merger.   (c) EXCHANGE RATIO FOR
DEMETER CAPITAL STOCK. Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.3, (i) each issued and
outstanding share of Common Stock of Demeter, $0.001 par value ("Demeter
Common Stock") (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.2626777 fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Finisar Common Stock (which amount shall be adjusted
for any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction effected between
the date hereof and the Effective Time) (the "Common Exchange Ratio"), and
(ii) each issued and outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock of
Demeter, $0.001 par value ("Demeter Preferred Stock") (other than shares to
be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.2705051 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Finisar
Common Stock (which amount will be adjusted for any stock split, stock
dividend or similar transaction effected between the date hereof and the
Effective Time) (the "Preferred Exchange Ratio" and, collectively with the
"Common Exchange Ratio," the "Exchange Ratios"). The Exchange Ratios
are subject to adjustment, as provided in Section 6.15. All such shares of
Demeter capital stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of
Finisar Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Finisar
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest. The Demeter Common Stock and Demeter Preferred Stock is sometimes
referred to herein as Demeter Capital Stock. The obligations of the holders
of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Demeter to make
additional payments for such shares has been taken into account in
calculating the Preferred Exchange Ratio and, accordingly, all such
obligations will be cancelled as a result of the Merger.   (d) DEMETER STOCK
OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, all then outstanding options to purchase
Demeter Common Stock (the "Demeter Options") issued under Demeter\'s 2000
Stock Option Plan (the "Demeter Option Plan") not exercised as of the
Effective Time will be assumed by Finisar and converted into Assumed Options
in accordance with Section 6.10.   Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. The
procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Demeter Capital Stock for
Finisar Common Stock pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   3    (a)
EXCHANGE AGENT. At the Effective Time, Finisar shall deposit with an exchange
agent designated by Finisar (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Demeter Capital Stock (the "Stockholders"), for exchange
in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Finisar Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1 and certificates representing the shares of Finisar Common Stock,
issuable and deliverable to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.3 (such
shares of Finisar Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), in exchange for outstanding shares of
Demeter Capital Stock.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Upon surrender by a holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Demeter Capital Stock (each
a "Certificate," and collectively, the "Certificates") for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Finisar, together with a duly executed agreement and letter of transmittal in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (a "Letter of Transmittal"), the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Finisar Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and
cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Demeter Capital Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Demeter, a certificate representing the shares of Finisar
Common Stock to which the holder is entitled may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Demeter Capital Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing
shares of Finisar Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Finisar Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.2. Finisar will
deliver certificates for shares of Finisar Common Stock, in accordance with
this Section 2.2(b), at the closing or, if later, immediately following the
Effective Time, to those holders of Demeter Capital Stock who submit their
certificate(s) and Letter of Transmittal at or prior to the Closing.   (c)
DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Finisar Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Finisar Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares payable to any such holder pursuant to subsection
(e) below shall be paid until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Finisar Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional shares of
Finisar Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection
(e) below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole
shares of Finisar Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a   4   payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Finisar
Common Stock.   (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN DEMETER CAPITAL
STOCK. All shares of Finisar Common Stock and cash issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Demeter Capital Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to subsection (c) or (e)
of this Section 2.2) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Demeter Capital
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Demeter Capital
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.2.   (e) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificate or
scrip representing fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Finisar. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Demeter Capital Stock exchanged pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Finisar Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Finisar
Common Stock multiplied by $36.50.   (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders
of Demeter after one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Finisar, upon demand, and any stockholders of Demeter who have not previously
complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Finisar for
payment of their claim for Finisar Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Finisar Common Stock, and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Finisar Common Stock.   (g) NO LIABILITY. Neither Finisar
nor Demeter shall be liable to any holder of shares of Demeter Capital Stock
or Finisar Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (h) LOST
CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Finisar shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares
of Finisar Common Stock issuable in exchange therefore pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, together with cash, if any, in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof. The Board
of Directors of Finisar may in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide to Finisar an indemnity agreement against
any claim that may be made against Finisar with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   5    Section 2.3
ESCROW.   (a) At the Closing, the Exchange Agent will deduct from
the number of shares of Finisar Common Stock deliverable to the Stockholders
and will deposit into escrow (the "Escrow") certificates representing ten
percent (10%) of the shares of Finisar Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger (the "Escrow Shares"). The Escrow Shares shall be held by U.S. Bank
Trust, National Association or such other financial institution as Finisar
and Demeter shall mutually determine (the "Escrow Agent") in accordance with
and subject to the provisions of an Escrow Agreement substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT B hereto (the "Escrow Agreement").   (b) Within ten (10)
days following the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow
Shares shall be released from the escrow subject to the provisions of Article
IX of this Agreement relating to claims of indemnification.   Section 2.4
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. In the event the Merger becomes effective without the
approval of the holders of 100% of the outstanding shares of Demeter Capital
Stock, any shares of Demeter Capital Stock held by stockholders who properly
exercise and perfect the dissenters\' rights set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted pursuant to Section 2.1,
but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration
as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL. Finisar shall have the right
to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the determination
of the fair value of the Demeter Capital Stock. Demeter agrees that, without
the prior written consent of Finisar or as required under the DGCL, it will
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or determine or offer
to determine, the fair value of the Demeter Capital Stock. Each holder
of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who, pursuant to the
provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of
Demeter Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the fair
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the provisions of the DGCL). In the event that any holder of Demeter Capital
Stock fails to make an effective demand for payment or otherwise loses his,
her or its status as a Dissenting Stockholder, Finisar shall, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event and subject to
compliance by such Dissenting Stockholder with the requirements of Section
2.2, issue and deliver, upon surrender by such Dissenting Stockholder of his,
her or its Certificate(s), the shares of Finisar Common Stock and cash,
including any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without
interest thereon, to which such Dissenting Stockholder would have been
entitled under Section 2.1.   Section 2.5 CERTIFICATE LEGENDS. The shares of
Finisar Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall not have
been registered and shall be characterized as "restricted securities" under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and under such
laws such shares may be resold without registration under the Securities Act
only in certain limited circumstances. Each certificate evidencing shares of
Finisar Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall bear the
following legend:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT
BEEN REGISTERED  UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE
SOLD OR  OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION WITHOUT
AN  EXEMPTION UNDER THE   6    SECURITIES ACT OR AN OPINION OF LEGAL
COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO  THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED."   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DEMETER  
Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed in the disclosure
schedule provided to Finisar on or before the date of this Agreement (the
"Demeter Disclosure Schedule"), Demeter represents and warrants to Finisar as
follows:   Section 3.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Demeter is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, has all requisite corporate power to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as currently
being conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted, and is duly
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its operations requires such qualification, except
where the failure to so qualify has not and is not reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.2(a)) on Demeter.
Demeter has delivered true and correct copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Demeter, each as amended to date, to Finisar.
Demeter is not in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws or other charter documents. Demeter does not directly
or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest
in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association
or entity.   Section 3.2 DEMETER CAPITAL STRUCTURE.   (a) The authorized
capital stock of Demeter consists of 40,000,000 shares of Demeter Common
Stock and 40,000,000 shares of Demeter Preferred Stock, 20,000,000 of which
have been designated Series A Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof,
4,000,000 shares of Demeter Common Stock and 14,000,701 shares of Demeter
Series A Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding and held of record by
those persons set forth in the Demeter Disclosure Schedule. All such
outstanding shares of Demeter Capital Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable federal and state
securities laws, and are not subject to any preemptive rights or rights
of first refusal created by statute, the charter documents of Demeter or
any agreement to which Demeter is a party or by which it is bound. As of the
date hereof, 3,000,000 shares of Demeter Common Stock are reserved for
issuance under the Demeter Option Plan, of which an aggregate of 2,157,000
shares are subject to outstanding options held by those persons set forth in
the Demeter Disclosure Schedule. As of the date hereof, 4,500,000 shares of
Demeter Series A Preferred Stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of outstanding warrants (the "Demeter Warrants").   (b) Except as set forth
in this Section 3.2 or the Demeter Disclosure Schedule, there are (i) no
equity securities of any class of Demeter, or any securities exchangeable
into or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for
issuance, or outstanding and (ii) no   7   outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, or other commitments or agreements of
any character to which Demeter is a party or by which it is bound obligating
Demeter to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any equity securities of Demeter or
obligating Demeter to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the
exercise price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no contracts, commitments or
agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of Demeter\'s capital stock
(i) between or among Demeter\'s and any of its stockholders or (ii) to
Demeter\'s knowledge, between or among any of Demeter\'s stockholders.  
Section 3.3 AUTHORITY; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS.   (a) Demeter has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all other documents required to be executed and delivered by Demeter
hereunder, including the Certificate of Merger (collectively, the
"Transaction Documents"), and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which Demeter is or will be a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Demeter, including the approval of the Merger by Demeter\'s stockholders as
required under the DGCL. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which Demeter is a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered
by Demeter and constitute or will constitute the valid and binding
obligations of Demeter, enforceable against Demeter in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) general principles of
equity.   (b) The execution and delivery by Demeter of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Demeter, (ii)
result in any violation or breach of or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) a default under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss
of any material benefit under, any note, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract
or other agreement or obligation to which Demeter is a party or by which
Demeter or any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict
with or violate any material permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Demeter or any of its properties or assets.   (c) No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity") is required by or with
respect to Demeter or its stockholders in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the DGCL, (ii) such
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may be required under applicable federal and state securities
laws, and (iii) such other consents, authorizations, filings,  
8   approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Demeter and would
not prevent or materially alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   Section 3.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Demeter has
delivered to Finisar its unaudited financial statements, including statements
of operations and cash flows for the period from Demeter\'s inception through
September 30, 2000 and a balance sheet as of September 30, 2000 (the "Balance
Sheet Date") (collectively, the "Demeter Financial Statements"). The Demeter
Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved, except that the Demeter Financial Statements do not contain
footnotes. The Demeter Financial Statements present fairly in all material
respects the financial position of Demeter as of the respective dates and the
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, subject
to normal year-end audit adjustments. Demeter maintains, and until the
Effective Time will continue to maintain, a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP.   Section 3.5 ABSENCE
OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Demeter does not have any liabilities of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable
or otherwise, of a kind required by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet
of Demeter, other than (i) liabilities reflected or provided for on the
balance sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date (the "Demeter Balance Sheet")
contained in the Demeter Financial Statements, and (ii) normal or recurring
liabilities incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices.   Section 3.6 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.
The accounts receivable shown on the Demeter Balance Sheet arose in the
ordinary course of business and have been collected or are collectible in the
book amounts thereof, less an amount not in excess of the allowance for
doubtful accounts and returns provided for in the Demeter Balance Sheet. The
accounts receivable of Demeter arising after the Balance Sheet Date and prior
to the Closing Date arose, or will arise, in the ordinary course of business
and have been collected or are reasonably expected to be collectible in the
book amounts thereof, less allowances for doubtful accounts and returns
determined in accordance with GAAP and the past practices of Demeter. None of
such accounts receivable is subject to any claim of offset or recoupment or
counterclaim, and Demeter has no knowledge of any specific facts that would
be likely to give rise to any such claim. Other than normal and usual
warranty and return obligations consistent with past practices, no amount of
such accounts receivable is contingent upon the performance by Demeter of
any obligation and no agreement for deduction or discount has been made with
respect to any such accounts receivable (except as reflected on the Demeter
Balance Sheet).   Section 3.7 INVENTORIES. Except to the extent of reserves
reflected on the Demeter Balance Sheet, the inventories shown on the Demeter
Balance Sheet or thereafter acquired by Demeter consist of items of a
quantity and quality reasonably expected to be usable or salable in the
ordinary course of business. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Demeter has
continued to replenish inventories in a normal and customary manner
consistent with past practices. Demeter has not received notice that it will
experience in the foreseeable future any difficulty in obtaining, in the
desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and upon reasonable
terms and conditions, the supplies or component products required for the
manufacture, assembly or   9   production of its products. The value at
which inventories are carried reflect the inventory valuation policy of
Demeter, which is consistent with its past practice and in accordance with
GAAP. Due provision has been made on the books of Demeter, consistent with
past practices, to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable
inventories at their estimated useful or scrap values, and such inventory
reserves are adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable
inventory and inventory shrinkage.   Section 3.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES
OR EVENTS. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Demeter has conducted its business
in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practices and,
since such date, Demeter has not:   (a) suffered any event or occurrence
that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Demeter;   (b) suffered any damage, destruction or loss, whether covered by
insurance or not, having a Material Adverse Effect on Demeter;   (c) granted
any material increase in the compensation payable or to become payable by
Demeter to its officers or (in the aggregate and except in the case of new

or made any other distribution on or in respect of the shares of its capital
stock or declared any direct or indirect redemption, retirement, purchase or
other acquisition of such shares;   (e) issued any shares of its capital

relating to such capital stock, other than shares of Demeter Common Stock
issued upon exercise of options outstanding under the Demeter Option Plans as
of the date of this Agreement and the issuance of options as set forth in the
Demeter Disclosure Schedule;   (f) made any change in the accounting methods
or practices it follows, whether for general financial or tax purposes, or
any change in depreciation or amortization policies or rates;   (g) sold,
leased, subleased, abandoned or otherwise disposed of any real property,
leasehold interests, machinery, equipment or other operating property other
than in the ordinary course of business;   (h) sold, assigned, transferred,
licensed or otherwise disposed of any patent, trademark, trade name, brand
name, copyright (or pending application for any patent, trademark or
copyright), invention, work of authorship, process, know-how, formula or
trade secret or interest thereunder or other material intangible asset;  
(i) entered into any material commitment or transaction (including, without
limitation, any borrowing or capital expenditure) other than in the ordinary
course of business;   10    (j) incurred any material liability, except
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice;   (k)
permitted or allowed any of its property, leasehold interests or assets to be
subjected to any liens, pledges, charges, restrictions on transfer,
mortgages, security interests or other encumbrances of any sort other than
(i) mechanics\', workmen\'s, repairmen\'s or other like liens arising
or incurred in the ordinary course of business in respect of obligations that
are not overdue, (ii) items relating to Taxes (as hereinafter defined) or
other governmental obligations not yet due or which are being contested in
good faith and, to the extent so contested, for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established on the Demeter Balance Sheet, (iii) other
imperfections of title or encumbrances, which do not materially and adversely
affect the value or marketability of the property subject thereto, (iv)
purchase money security interests incurred in the ordinary course of business
and (v) items disclosed in the Demeter Disclosure Schedule ("Liens");   (l)
made any capital expenditure or commitment for additions to property, plant
or equipment individually in excess of $50,000, or, in the aggregate, in
excess of $100,000;   (m) paid, loaned or advanced any amount to, or
sold, transferred or leased any properties or assets to, or entered into any
agreement or arrangement with, any of its officers, directors or stockholders
or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, other than employee compensation
and benefits and reimbursement of employment related business expenses
incurred in the ordinary course of business; or   (n) agreed to take any
action described in this Section 3.8 or which would constitute a breach of
any of the representations or warranties of Demeter contained in this
Agreement.   Section 3.9 TAXES.   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Tax" or, collectively, "Taxes," means any and all federal, state and local
taxes of any country, assessments and other governmental charges, duties,
impositions and liabilities, including taxes based upon or measured by gross
receipts, income, profits, sales, use, occupation and volume, quantity or
weight of hazardous wastes generated or disposed of in California, and value
added, ad valorem, transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll, recapture,
employment, excise and property taxes, together with all interest, penalties
and additions imposed with respect to such amounts and any obligations under
any agreements or arrangements with any other person with respect to such
amounts and including any liability for taxes of a predecessor entity.  
(b) Demeter has prepared and timely filed all returns, estimates, information
statements and reports required to be filed by it with any taxing authority
("Returns") relating to any and all Taxes concerning or attributable to
Demeter or its operations, such Returns are true and correct in all material
respects and have been completed in all material respects in accordance with
applicable law, and Demeter has disclosed on its Returns all positions taken
therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement penalty within
the meaning of     11   Section 6662 of the Code (or any predecessor
provision or comparable provision of state, local or foreign law).   (c)
Demeter (i) has paid all Taxes it is required to pay and (ii) has withheld
with respect to its employees all Taxes required to be withheld.   (d)
Demeter has not been delinquent in the payment of any Tax. There is no Tax
deficiency outstanding or assessed or proposed against Demeter that is not
reflected as a liability on the Demeter Balance Sheet or set forth on the
Demeter Disclosure Schedule, nor has Demeter executed any agreements or
waivers extending any statute of limitations on or extending the period for
the assessment or collection of any Tax.   (e) The amount of Demeter\'s
liability for unpaid Taxes (whether actual or contingent) for all periods
through the date hereof and the Closing Date does not and will not, in the
aggregate, exceed the amount of the current liability accruals for Taxes
(excluding reserves for deferred Taxes) reflected on the Demeter Balance
Sheet (other than Taxes which have accrued after the date of such Demeter
Balance Sheet).   (f) Demeter is not a party to any tax-sharing agreement
or similar arrangement with any other party, and Demeter has not assumed or
agreed to pay any Tax obligations of, or with respect to any transaction
relating to, any other person or agreed to indemnify any other person with
respect to any Tax.   (g) Demeter\'s Returns have never been audited by
a government or taxing authority, nor is any such audit in process or
pending, and Demeter has not been notified of any request for such an audit
or other examination.   (h) Demeter has never been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax
return.   (i) Demeter has made available to Finisar copies of all Returns
filed for all periods since its inception.   (j) Demeter has never filed any
consent agreement under Section 341(f) of the Code or agreed to have Section
341(f)(4) apply to any disposition of assets owned by Demeter.   (k)
Demeter is not a party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement,
including but not limited to the provisions of this Agreement, covering any
employee or former employee of Demeter that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code by Demeter or Sub as an
expense under applicable law.   (l) Demeter has not constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.   12    (m) Demeter has not agreed to make,
nor is it required to make, any adjustment under Section 481 of the Code by

is treated as "tax-exempt use property," within the meaning of Section 168(h)

"reporting corporation" subject to the information reporting and record

thereunder.   (p) Demeter has never been a party to any joint
venture, partnership or other agreement that could be treated as a
partnership for Tax purposes.   (q) There are (and immediately following
the Effective Time there will be) no Liens on the assets of Demeter relating
to or attributable to Taxes.   (r) Demeter has not received any notice from
any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Demeter has not filed Returns

3.10 TANGIBLE ASSETS AND REAL PROPERTY.   (a) Demeter owns, leases or has a
valid right to use all tangible assets and properties which are material to
the conduct of its business as currently conducted or which are reflected on
the Demeter Balance Sheet or acquired since the Balance Sheet Date (the
"Material Tangible Assets"). The Material Tangible Assets are in good
operating condition and repair. Demeter has good title to all Material
Tangible Assets that it owns (except properties, interests in properties and
assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the Demeter Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all Liens. Assuming the
due execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto, all leases
of Material Tangible Assets and all other contracts or agreements under which
Demeter claims the right to use Material Tangible Assets to which Demeter is
a party are in full force and effect and valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws

proprietary information or material that are material to the conduct of the
business of Demeter as currently being conducted, or as currently proposed to

the-shelf software used in the conduct of Demeter\' business), (iv) all joint
development agreements to which Demeter is a party, and (v) all agreements
with Governmental Entities or other third parties pursuant to which Demeter
has obtained funding for research and development activities.   (c) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, compliance with its terms and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) or give rise to any right, license
or Lien relating to any Demeter Intellectual Property Rights, or right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any Demeter
Intellectual Property Rights, or the loss or encumbrance of any Demeter
Intellectual Property Rights or material benefit related thereto, or result
in or require the creation, imposition or extension of any Lien upon any
Demeter Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise impair the right of Demeter
or its customers to use the Demeter Intellectual Property Rights in the same
manner as such Demeter Intellectual Property Rights are currently being used
by Demeter or the customers of Demeter.   14    (d) All patents and
registered trademarks, registered service marks and registered copyrights
issued to Demeter which relate to any Demeter Product are valid and
subsisting. The manufacturing, marketing, licensing or sale of any Demeter

copyright, mask work right, trade secret or other proprietary right of any
third party. Demeter (i) has not received notice that it has been sued in any
suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement of any
patent, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, mask work right,
trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party and (ii) has no

copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, mask work right or other
claims relating to the Demeter Intellectual Property Rights to which Demeter
is a party or by which it is bound.   (e) All designs, drawings,
specifications, source code, object code, documentation, flow charts and
diagrams incorporated, embodied or reflected in any Demeter Product at any
stage of its development were written, developed and created solely and
exclusively by (i) employees of Demeter without the assistance of any third
party or (ii) third parties who assigned ownership of their rights with
respect thereto to Demeter by means of valid and enforceable agreements,
which are listed and described in the Demeter Disclosure Schedule and copies
of which have been provided to Finisar, subject, in either case, to the use
by such persons of licensed off-the-shelf software and information in the
public domain. Demeter has at all times used commercially reasonable efforts
to protect its trade secrets. None of the trade secrets of Demeter have been
published or disclosed by Demeter or, to the knowledge of Demeter, by any
other person, to any person except pursuant to licenses or contracts
requiring such other persons to keep such trade secrets confidential.   (f)

currently proposed to be conducted by Demeter, which patents or applications
have not been assigned to Demeter with such assignment duly recorded in the
United States Patent Office or with the applicable foreign Governmental
Entity.   15    (j) Each person currently or formerly employed by
Demeter (including consultants and independent contractors, if any) that has
or had access to confidential information of Demeter has executed and
delivered to Demeter a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in one of
the forms previously provided to Finisar. To the knowledge of Demeter (which
qualification shall not apply to contracts, convenants or instruments between
such persons and AXT, Inc.), neither the execution or delivery of any such
agreement by any such person, nor the carrying on by any such person, as an
employee, consultant or independent contractor, of Demeter\'s business as
currently conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted, has or will
conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any contract, covenant or instrument under
which any of such persons is obligated.   Section 3.12 BANK ACCOUNTS. The

NSM QUOTATION. Finisar shall cause the shares of Finisar Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on the NSM, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.   Section 6.8 FORM
S-3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.   (a) Finisar shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause the shares of Finisar Common Stock issued in the Merger other than
the Escrow Shares (the "Registrable Securities") to be registered under the
Securities Act so as to permit the resale thereof, and in connection
therewith shall use its best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC within
[thirty (30) days] following the Closing Date, and shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause to become effective no later than sixty (60) days
thereafter, a registration statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form
S-3 or on such other form as is then available under the Securities Act
covering the   29   Registrable Securities; provided, however, that each
holder of Registrable Securities ("Holder") shall provide all such
information and materials to Finisar and take all such action as may be
required in order to permit Finisar to comply with all applicable
requirements of the SEC and to obtain any desired acceleration of the
effective date of such Registration Statement. Such provision of information
and materials is a condition precedent to the obligations of Finisar pursuant
to this Section 6.8. Finisar shall not be required to effect more than one
(1) registration under this Section 6.8. The offering made pursuant to such
registration shall not be underwritten.   (b) Notwithstanding Section
6.8(a), Finisar shall be entitled to postpone the filing or declaration of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a reasonable period of time
up to sixty (60) calendar days after the deadlines therefore set forth in
Section 6.8(a), if Finisar determines that there exists material nonpublic
information about Finisar which would be required by the Securities Act to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement, the disclosure of which, in the good
faith determination of the Board of Directors of Finisar, would be
detrimental to Finisar.   (c) Subject to the limitations of Section 6.8(b),
Finisar shall: (i) prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC
in accordance with Section 6.8(a) with respect to the Registrable Securities
and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective as promptly as practicable after filing and to keep the
Registration Statement effective until one (1) year after the Effective Time;
(ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary, and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the sale or other disposition of all securities proposed to be
registered in the Registration Statement until one (1) year after the
Effective Time; and (iii) furnish to each Holder such number of copies of any
prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus and any amended or
supplemented prospectus) in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents, as each Holder may reasonably
request in order to effect the offering and sale of the Registrable
Securities to be offered and sold.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 6.8, Finisar shall have the right at any time to require that
all Holders suspend further open market offers and sales of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement whenever, and for so long
as, in the reasonable judgment of Finisar in good faith after consultation
with counsel, there is or may be in existence material undisclosed
information or events with respect to Finisar (the "Suspension Right"). In
the event Finisar exercises the Suspension Right, such suspension will
continue for the period of time reasonably necessary for disclosure to occur
at a time that is not materially detrimental to Finisar and its stockholders
or until such time as the information or event is no longer material, each as
determined in good faith by Finisar after consultation with counsel. Finisar
will use all reasonable efforts to limit the length of the suspension to
thirty (30) calendar days or less. Finisar agrees to notify the Holders
promptly upon termination of the suspension.   (e) Finisar will indemnify
each Holder, each of its officers and directors and partners, and each person
controlling such Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act against all expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of
any litigation, commenced or threatened, arising out of or based on any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a   30   material fact
contained in any registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus,
offering circular or other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
incident to any registration, qualification or compliance effected pursuant
to this Section 6.8, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, or any violation or any alleged violation by Finisar of
any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance,
and Finisar will reimburse each such Holder, each of its officers and
directors, and each person controlling such Holder, each such underwriter and
each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or
defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as such expenses
are incurred, provided that Finisar will not be liable in any such case to
the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out
of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to Finisar by such Holder or controlling person and
specifically for use therein.   (f) It shall be a condition to Finisar\'s
obligations hereunder to register the Registrable Securities of any Holder
that such Holder agrees to indemnify Finisar, each of Finisar\'s directors
and officers, each person who controls Finisar within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act, and each other such Holder, each of its officers
and directors and each person controlling such Holder within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all claims, losses, damages and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained
in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other
document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse Finisar, such other Holders,
directors, officers, persons or control persons for any legal or any other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, as such expenses are
incurred, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or
alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus,
offering circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to Finisar by such Holder specifically for use
therein.   (g) Each party entitled to indemnification under Section 6.8(e)
or 6.8(f) (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required
to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may
be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that
counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at such party\'s expense; provided, however, that
an Indemnified Party (together with all other Indemnified Parties which may
be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to
retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, if representation of such Indemnified Party by the
counsel retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to
differing or   31   potentially differing interests between such
Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
Section 6.8(e) or 6.8(f) unless the failure to give such notice is materially
prejudicial to an Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend such action. No
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.   Section 6.9 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. Effective on the Closing Date,
each of Robert Shih and Ted Young (the "Key Employees") will become employees
of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of Employment
Agreements substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto (collectively, the
"Employment Agreements").   Section 6.10 STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Demeter Option which has not been exercised
prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Finisar
and converted into an option (an "Assumed Option") to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Demeter Option (except as
otherwise provided below), the number of shares of Finisar Common Stock which
the holder of such Demeter Option would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to the Merger (to be adjusted based on the release of shares from
the Escrow) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at a price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the aggregate
exercise price of the Demeter Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
Demeter Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii)
the number of full shares of Finisar Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the Assumed Option. The vesting schedule of each Assumed Option shall be as
set forth in the option agreement for each Demeter Option and shall not
be accelerated in contemplation of or as a consequence of the Merger, except
for acceleration of the final 12-month vesting periods in accordance
with outstanding Demeter Option Agreements.   (b) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Finisar shall deliver to the holders of the Demeter
Options an appropriate notice setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant
thereto and the grants pursuant thereto shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
after giving effect to the Merger). Finisar shall, to the extent required by
and subject to the provisions of the Demeter Option Plan, take such actions
as may be appropriate under the Code and the regulations thereunder to cause
the Assumed Options representing assumed Demeter Options which qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted under the Code and the regulations thereunder.   (c) Finisar
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Finisar Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Finisar shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares  
32   of Finisar Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options and shall use
its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses in connection therewith) for so long as any Assumed Options
remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who, subsequent to the
Merger, will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, where applicable, Finisar shall administer the Assumed
Options in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.   Section 6.11 FINISAR PLANS. All Demeter employees who
remain employees of Finisar, Demeter or any other Subsidiary of Finisar
following the Effective Time shall be entitled to participate in all employee
benefit plans and programs (the "Finisar Plans") that are available to other
Finisar employees holding comparable positions. To the extent permitted by
the Finisar Plans, each participant shall be given full credit for such
participant\'s period of continuous service with Demeter prior to the
Effective Time. To the extent permitted by law, Finisar shall amend the
Finisar Plans, as necessary, to provide for such participation. In the case
of medical and health insurance coverage, Finisar shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue to insure Demeter employees under Demeter\'s existing
insurance plans or provide them with the opportunity to participate in
Finisar Plans providing generally comparable medical and health insurance
coverage.   Section 6.12 HIRING BONUS. Finisar shall offer all employees
of Demeter a signing bonus of up to 10% of their annual base salary upon
their acceptance of employment following the Closing of the Merger.  
Section 6.13 BROKERS OR FINDERS. Each of Finisar and Demeter represents, as
to itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be
entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except Broadview International, financial advisor to Finisar, to
which Finisar has agreed to pay fees and expenses in connection with
financial advisory services, and each of Finisar and Demeter agrees to
indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities or obligations with respect to any other fees, commissions or
expenses asserted by any person on the basis of any act or statement alleged
to have been made by such party or its Affiliate.   Section 6.14 ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including cooperating fully with the other party, including by
provision of information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Demeter will provide to Finisar, and will use its best efforts to cause AXT,
Inc. to provide to Finisar, all financial and accounting records that shall
be reasonably requested by Finisar for the purpose of preparing
financial statements of Demeter for any period, or as of any date, prior to
the Effective Time to the extent such financial statements are required by
GAAP or the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. In case at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of   33   either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such
necessary action.   Section 6.15 EXPENSES. The parties shall each pay their
own legal, accounting, financial advisory and consulting fees and other out-
of-pocket expenses related to the negotiation, preparation and carrying out
of this Agreement and the transactions herein contemplated. In the event the
Merger is consummated all legal, accounting, financial advisory and
consulting fees and expenses incurred by Demeter (whether paid or accrued)
relating to the negotiation, preparation and carrying out of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and obtaining all authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings with, all
Governmental Entities in connection with such transactions (the "Demeter
Transaction Expenses") shall be borne by the former security holders of
Demeter, as hereinafter provided. SCHEDULE 6.15 hereto sets forth Demeter\'s
current estimate of the total Demeter Transaction Expenses which Demeter
expects to incur (the "Estimated Demeter Transaction Expenses"). The parties
acknowledge that the Exchange Ratios have been established on the basis of
the Estimated Demeter Transaction Expenses. In the event the Demeter
Transaction Expenses actually incurred by Demeter exceed the amount shown on
the Closing Demeter Transaction Expense Schedule, Finisar shall be entitled
to assert a claim against the Escrow Shares pursuant to Article IX hereof in
order to recover all such additional expenses.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS

THE MERGER. The respective obligations of each party to this Agreement to
effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a) All authorizations,

other party):   (a) by the mutual written consent of Finisar and
Demeter;   (b) by either Finisar or Demeter if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by December 1, 2000; provided, however, that the right

been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
before such date;   (c) by either Finisar or Demeter if a court of

Section 6.4 or 6.6 of this Agreement; or   (d) by Finisar or Demeter, if
there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this Agreement, which
breach (i) causes the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) (in the
case of termination by Finisar) or 7.3(a) or (b) (in the case of termination
by Demeter) not to be satisfied and (ii) shall not have been cured within ten
(10) business days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice
of such breach from the other party.   Section 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In
the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Finisar, Demeter, Sub or
their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates, except to
the extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party

Agreement; provided that the provisions of Sections 6.14 and 6.16 of this
Agreement, the confidentiality provisions set forth herein and in the
Confidentiality Agreement and the non-solicitation provisions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.   37    Section 8.3
AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the

date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "Termination
Date") or (ii) except for claims under Section 9.2(d), as allowed by law.  
Section 9.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY STOCKHOLDERS.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions contained herein, Finisar, its officers, directors, employees and
attorneys, all Subsidiaries and Affiliates of Finisar, and the respective

persons and entities being collectively referred to as the "Finisar Group")
shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow any and all losses, damages,
costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) which any
member of the Finisar Group may sustain or incur which are caused by or arise
out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants made by Demeter in this Agreement, including the
Demeter Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any Demeter Transaction Expenses in excess
of the amount set forth on the Closing Demeter Transaction Expense Schedule
and reflected in the calculation of the applicable Exchange Ratio, or (iii)
any breach of this Article IX or the Escrow Agreement (collectively, "Finisar
Losses").   (b) No member of the Finisar Group shall be entitled to recover
any Finisar Losses until the aggregate amount of all Finisar Losses under all
claims shall exceed $150,000 (the "Deductible Amount"); provided, however,
that Finisar Losses under Section 9.2(a)(ii) shall be recoverable in full
without regard to the Deductible Amount.   38    (c) The right of a
member of the Finisar Group to recover a Finisar Loss under this Article IX
is subject to the condition that the Stockholders\' Representative (as
defined in Section 9.6) shall have received written notice of an
Indemnification Claim (as defined in Section 9.3) for such Finisar Loss on or
before the Termination Date.   (d) The provisions of Section 9.2(b) above
and 9.5 below shall not limit, in any manner, any remedy at law or in equity
to which any member of the Finisar Group shall be entitled against Demeter or
any stockholder of Demeter as a result of willful fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Demeter, any stockholder of Demeter or any of their
respective representatives.   (e) The amount of Finisar Losses shall be
computed after giving effect to the receipt of any insurance proceeds and tax
benefits with respect thereto.   Section 9.3 PROCEDURES FOR RECOVERY.  
(a) As used in this Article IX, the term "Indemnitee" means the member or
members of the Finisar Group seeking recovery from the Escrow.   (b) A claim
for recovery from the Escrow (an "Indemnification Claim") shall be made by
Indemnitee by delivery of a written notice to the Stockholders\'
Representative and the Escrow Agent requesting recovery and specifying in
reasonable detail the basis on which recovery is sought (and shall include
relevant documentation related to the Indemnification Claim), the amount of
the asserted Finisar Losses and, in the case of a Third Party Claim (as
defined in Section 9.4), containing (by attachment or otherwise) such other
information as Indemnitee shall have concerning such Third Party Claim.  
(c) If the Indemnification Claim involves a Third Party Claim, the procedures
set forth in Section 9.4 hereof shall be observed by Indemnitee and the
Stockholders\' Representative.   Section 9.4 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.
Should any claim be made or suit or proceeding be instituted against an
Indemnitee which, if prosecuted successfully, would be a matter for which
such Indemnitee is entitled to recovery under this Article IX (a "Third Party
Claim"), the obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:   (a) Such Indemnitee shall give the
Stockholders\' Representative and the Escrow Agent written notice of any such
Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice thereof, and
the Stockholders\' Representative may, subject to the prior written consent
of Finisar, undertake control of the defense thereof by counsel of his own
choosing reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. Indemnitee may participate in
the defense through its own counsel at its own expense. If, however, the
Stockholders\' Representative fails or refuses to undertake the defense of
such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such
claim has been delivered to the Stockholders\' Representative by Indemnitee,
Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the defense and, subject to
Section 9.5, settlement of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own
choosing. In the circumstances described in the preceding sentence,  
39   Indemnitee shall, promptly upon its assumption of the defense of such
Third Party Claim, make an Indemnification Claim as specified in Section
9.3(b), which shall be deemed an Indemnification Claim that is not a Third
Party Claim for the purposes of the procedures set forth herein. Failure of
Indemnitee to furnish written notice to the Stockholders\' Representative or
the Escrow Agent of a Third Party Claim shall not release the Stockholders
from their obligations hereunder, except to the extent they are prejudiced by
such failure.   (b) Indemnitee and the Stockholders\' Representative
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such claim and furnishing employees of Indemnitee as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such Third
Party Claim or for testimony as witness in any proceeding relating to such
claim.   (c) Unless the Stockholders\' Representative has failed to fulfill
its obligations under this Article IX, no settlement by Indemnitee of a Third
Party Claim shall be made without the prior written consent by or on behalf
of the Stockholders\' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If the Stockholders\' Representative has assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim as contemplated by this Section 9.4, no
settlement of such Third Party Claim may be made by the
Stockholders\' Representative without the prior written consent by or on
behalf of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   Section 9.5 MANNER OF INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The Escrow Shares
deposited into Escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.3 shall provide a fund against which members of the
Finisar Group may assert claims under this Article IX. Except as specifically
provided in Section 9.2(d), the sole recourse of any member of the Finisar
Group for claims with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby is to the Escrow Shares.   (b) Each claim asserted
pursuant to this Article IX shall be made only in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement, subject to the provisions of
Section 9.2(d) hereof.   Section 9.6 APPOINTMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS\'
REPRESENTATIVE. For purposes of this Agreement, the stockholders of Demeter,
without any further action on the part of any such stockholder, shall be
deemed to have consented to the appointment of Tim Greaves as the
representative and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of such stockholders
(the "Stockholders\' Representative"), and to the taking by the
Stockholders\' Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by him under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the exercise of the
power to (i) execute the Escrow Agreement, (ii) authorize delivery to Finisar
of Escrow Shares in satisfaction of Indemnification Claims, (iii) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
Indemnification Claims, (iv) resolve any Indemnification Claims and (v) take
all actions necessary in the judgment of the Stockholders\' Representative
for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Accordingly, the Stockholders\'
Representative has unlimited authority and power to act on   40   behalf
of each stockholder with respect to the disposition, settlement or
other handling of all Indemnification Claims against the Escrow. With respect
to any interest in the Escrow, the stockholders of Demeter will be bound by
all actions taken by the Stockholders\' Representative in connection with all
Indemnification Claims, and Finisar shall be entitled to rely on any action
or decision of the Stockholders\' Representative. The Stockholders\'
Representative will incur no liability with respect to any action taken or
suffered by him in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other document believed by him to be genuine and to have been
signed by the proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine
the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except his
own willful misconduct or bad faith. In all questions arising under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders\' Representative may rely
on the advice of counsel, and the Stockholders\' Representative will not be
liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Stockholders\' Representative based on such advice. Except as expressly
provided herein, the Stockholders\' Representative will not be required to
take any action involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is
made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to him. At any time during the
term of the Escrow Agreement, holders of a majority of the Escrow Shares
subject to Indemnification Claims under this Article IX may, by written
consent, appoint a new representative as the Stockholders\' Representative by
sending notice and a copy of the written consent appointing such new
representative signed by holders of a majority of the Escrow Shares to
Finisar and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective upon the
later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is
received by Finisar and the Escrow Agent.   ARTICLE X   GENERAL
