will be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the Working Capital
Adjustment set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet will be final and binding
upon the parties for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price under this
Agreement. During such 30-day period, the Buyer will provide the
Representative with reasonable access to the relevant Books and Records and
the Groups accounting personnel during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice.

(iii) Following the Buyers receipt of any Objection Notice, the Buyer and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the
event that the Representative and the Buyer fail to agree on any of the
Representatives objections set forth in the Objection Notice within 30 days
after the Buyer receives the Objection Notice, the Representative and the
Buyer shall engage the Independent Auditor to resolve any items remaining in
dispute (the " _WC Disputed Items_ "). The Independent Auditor shall within
the 30-day period immediately following referral of the Closing Balance Sheet
to the Independent Auditor, make the final determination of the WC Disputed
Items and the resulting Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
Adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Buyer and the
Representative each shall provide the Independent Auditor with their
respective determinations of the WC Disputed Items and the resulting Closing
Balance Sheet and the Working Capital Adjustment; provided, that
such determinations may not differ to the detriment of the other party from
the Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i) or the
Objection Notice, as applicable. The Independent Auditor shall make an
independent determination of the WC Disputed Items and resulting Working
Capital Adjustment that, assuming compliance with the previous clause, shall
be within the range proposed by the Buyer and the Representative,
respectively, and shall be final and binding on the Sellers, the
Representative and the Buyer; provided that the Independent Auditor shall in
no event modify any components or calculations of the Working Capital
Adjustment that are not WC Disputed Items. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Auditor shall be paid by the party whose net Working Capital
Adjustment was different by the greater amount from that of the Independent
Auditor.

 



21 (c) Promptly after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
Adjustment are determined and become final and binding on the parties under
this Section 2.3, the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be calculated by giving
effect to such final and binding determinations. If the Adjusted Purchase
Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Buyer shall pay to the
Representative within two (2) Business Days following the Settlement Date, an
amount equal to the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Purchase Price. If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the
Adjusted Purchase Price, then the Representative shall pay to the Buyer,
within two (2) Business Days following the Settlement Date, an amount equal to
the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Adjusted
Purchase Price.

(d) The Buyer and the Sellers shall each make reasonably available to the
Independent Auditor all relevant Books and Records relating to the Group, as
reasonably requested by the Independent Auditor and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Independent Auditor in resolving any
disputed matters.

 

(e) The parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the provisions of this
Section 2.3 and the arbitration and the arbitration provisions contemplated
in this Section 2.3 shall be the exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the
parties with respect to the Working Capital Adjustment contemplated in this
Section 2.3, _provided, however_ , that if a party fails to timely pay any
sums required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section 2.3 the dispute
resolution provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement shall apply.

 

2.4. _Earnout_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall prepare and deliver the Earnout Statement to the
Representative no later than the Earnout Statement Date.

 

(b) On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the Buyers delivery
of the Earnout Statement, the Representative may give the Buyer an Objection
Notice. Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar
amount of any objection and the basis therefor. Any determination set forth on
the Earnout Statement which is not specifically objected to in the Objection
Notice shall be deemed acceptable and shall be final and binding upon the
parties upon delivery of the Objection Notice. If the Representative does not
give the Buyer an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the
Earnout Statement will be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the
calculation of the Earnout Payment, if any, set forth in the Earnout Statement
will be final and binding upon the parties for purposes of calculating the
Earnout Payment under this Agreement. During such 30-day period, the Buyer
shall provide the Representative with reasonable access to the relevant Books
and Records and the Groups accounting personnel during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice.

(c) Following the Buyers receipt of any Objection Notice, the Buyer and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the
event that the Representative and the Buyer fail to agree on any of the
Representatives objections set forth in the Objection Notice within 30 days
after the Buyer receives the Objection Notice, the

 



22  Representative and the Buyer shall engage the Independent Auditor to resolve
any items remaining in dispute (the " _EO Disputed Items_ "). The Independent
Auditor shall within the 30-day period immediately following referral of the
Earnout Statement to the Independent Auditor, make the final determination of
the EO Disputed Items and the resulting Earnout Payment in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Buyer and the Representative each shall provide
the Independent Auditor with their respective determinations of the EO
Disputed Items and the resulting Earnout Payment; provided, that such
determinations may not differ to the detriment of the other party from the
Earnout Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or the Objection
Notice, as applicable. The Independent Auditor shall make an independent
determination of the EO Disputed Items and resulting Earnout Payment that,
assuming compliance with the previous clause, shall be within the range
proposed by the Buyer and the Representative, respectively, and shall be final
and binding on the Sellers, the Representative and the Buyer if such
independent determination is within the range proposed by the Buyer; provided
that the Independent Auditor shall in no event modify any components or
calculations of the Earnout Statement that are not EO Disputed Items. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by the
party whose Earnout Payment was different by the greater amount from that of
the Independent Auditor.

(d) Promptly after the Earnout Payment is determined and becomes final and
binding on the parties under this Section 2.4, the Purchase Price shall be
recalculated by giving effect to such final and binding determinations. If an
Earnout Payment is due to be paid to the Sellers then the Buyer and the
Representative shall cause the Earnout Escrow Agent to pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Representative from the Earnout Escrow
Amount within two (2) Business Days following the Settlement Date, an amount
equal to the Earnout Payment up to the Earnout Escrow Amount. If the Earnout
Escrow Amount is less than the Earnout Payment then the Buyer shall pay by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Representative the amount
of such excess within two (2) Business Days following the Settlement Date. If
the Earnout Escrow Amount is greater than the Earnout Payment then any
remaining balance of the Earnout Escrow Amount shall be released to the Buyer
pursuant to the Earnout Escrow Agreement and the Representative shall join
Buyer in instructing the Earnout Escrow Agent to pay any such remaining
balance to Buyer from the Earnout Escrow Amount within two (2) Business Days
following the Settlement Date.

(e) The Buyer shall make reasonably available to the Independent Auditor all
relevant Books and Records relating to the Group, as reasonably requested by
the Independent Auditor and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Independent Auditor in resolving any disputed matters.

 

(f) The parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the provisions of this
Section 2.4 and the arbitration and the arbitration provisions contemplated
in this Section 2.4 shall be the exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the
parties with respect to the Earnout Payment contemplated in this Section 2.4,
_provided, however_ , that if a party fails to timely pay any sums required
to be paid by it pursuant to this Section 2.4 the dispute resolution
provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement shall apply.

 



23 (g) After the Closing and through December 31, 2015, the Buyer shall cause the
Group to be operated as a stand-alone business with unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Group being prepared in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with _Schedule IV_ on a stand-alone basis and on a basis consistent

administrative, operating and other costs, expenses and charges that are for
the benefit of the Group that are directly incurred by the Group or otherwise
paid by the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer) and allocated to the
Group shall be taken into account on a pro rata basis between the Group and
the Buyer and (B) costs for billable technicians of the Buyer may be charged
to the Group at cost only for such time that is actually billable by the Group
to the Groups customer and shall be taken into account in the calculation of
EBITDA subject to any other applicable exclusions or adjustments set forth
herein;

 

(ii) all non-cash expenses, charges, losses or other liabilities related to
(1) the write-down or write-off of any intangible asset of the Group as a
result of the impairment thereof; (2) non-cash compensation expenses that
arise solely as a result of the Buyers or its Affiliates compensation

2.5. _Closing_. The Closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall occur electronically via email and facsimile as at 11:59 p.m.
on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the parties mutually agree to a physical closing or it is required by the
lenders providing debt financing with respect to the transaction contemplated

Closing Date.

2.6. _Allocation of the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Tax Treatment_. The parties agree that, for income tax purposes, the
purchase and sale of the Seller Units and the Option Units shall be treated
as a sale of partnership interests in the Company by the Selling Unit Holders
and Option Holders and a purchase of the assets (including its Equity Interest
in Qualspec Holdings), subject to the liabilities of the Company, by the
Buyer, pursuant to Situation 2 of Internal Revenue Service Rev. Rul. 99-6,
1999-1 C.B. 432. The parties further agree to prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed all income Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with such Tax treatment.

(b) _Allocation Amongst the Acquired Group and Assets of Qualspec Holdings_.
The parties agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated amongst each
entity within the Acquired Group (and assets of Qualspec Holdings and Qualspec
LLC) based on the final Appraisal Allocation (as defined below) set forth
herein. Promptly following Closing, the Buyer shall engage an independent
public accounting firm (the " _Appraiser_ ") to provide an independent
appraisal (" _Appraisal Allocation_ ") (i) as to the fair market value as of
the Closing Date of each entity within the Acquired Group (with the exception
of Qualspec LLC, which is treated as a "disregarded entity" for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes) and (ii) as to the fair market value of the underlying
assets of Qualspec Holdings (which would include the assets of Qualspec LLC,
treated as a "disregarded entity" for U.S. federal income Tax purposes), which
shall be determined in a manner consistent with Code Sections 755 and 1060(d)
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, based upon the allocated Purchase
Price and any liabilities assumed. The Appraiser shall deliver the Appraisal
Allocation to the Representative and the Buyer on or prior to the sixtieth
(60th) day _following_ the Closing Date. The Representative and Buyer shall

 



25  have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Appraisal Allocation to
object in writing to the Appraisal Allocation, providing a detail description
as to any objections. During such thirty (30) day period, the Buyer shall
afford the Representative and its accountants full access to the books and
records of the Buyer as they pertain to the allocations. If the Representative
and/or Buyer object to the Appraisal Allocation within such thirty (30) day
period, the disputed components of the Appraisal Allocation shall be
considered by the Appraiser and the Appraiser shall render a final written
decision resolving the matter, including a final Appraisal Allocation,
within twenty (20) days following the last submission of any timely
objections. If the Representative and Buyer both fail to timely object to the
Appraisal Allocation as originally prepared by the Appraiser, such Appraisal
Allocation shall be deemed final for purposes of this Agreement. The costs
and expenses of the Appraiser shall be borne by Buyer.

(c) _Binding Effect_. The parties shall be bound by the allocations pursuant
to this Section 2.6, and (i) shall apply such allocation for all purposes,
including the Purchase Price allocation and determining any Taxes, (ii) shall
prepare and file all Tax Returns including, with respect to Qualspec Holdings
(applying Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, Situation 2 with respect to
the acquisition of the Company) and Northstar GP, for purposes of Section 751
of the Code and the statement required to be filed under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.751-1(a)(3), and Section 755 of the Code and the tax basis
adjustments under Section 743 of the Code, in a manner consistent with such
allocations, and (iii) shall not take any position inconsistent with such
allocation in any Tax Return, Tax Proceeding or otherwise. In the event that
any allocation hereunder is questioned, audited or disputed by any
Governmental Entity, the party receiving notice thereof shall promptly notify
and consult with the other parties concerning the strategy for the resolution
thereof, and shall keep the other parties apprised of the status of such
question, Tax Proceeding and the resolution thereof.

 

2.7. _Quantapoint Working Capital_.

 

(a) By the later of (i) seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date and (ii)
the date on which the Working Capital Adjustment (as defined in the QP Merger
Agreement) (the "QP WC Adjustment") is finally determined pursuant to the QP
Merger Agreement, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative
the final Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in the QP Merger Agreement) (the
"QP Closing Balance Sheet"), the QP WC Adjustment and the resulting amount, if
any, either owed by Buyer or Sellers as calculated in accordance with the
methodology and examples set forth on _Schedule VII_ (the "QP WC
Reconciliation").

(b) On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the Buyers delivery of
the information and calculations set forth in Section 2.7(a), the
Representative may give the Buyer an Objection Notice; provided, that neither
the Representative nor any Seller shall be permitted to object to the QP WC
Adjustment or the QP Closing Balance Sheet underlying the calculation of the
QP WC Reconciliation, and may only object to the calculation of the QP WC
Reconciliation as being inconsistent with the methodology and examples set
forth on _Schedule VII_. Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis therefor. If the
Representative does not give the Buyer an Objection Notice within such thirty
(30) day period, then the amount of the QP WC Reconciliation will be
conclusive and binding upon the parties.

 



26 (c) Following the Buyers receipt of any Objection Notice, the Buyer and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the
event that the Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of the
Representatives objections set forth in the Objection Notice within thirty
(30) days after the Buyer receives the Objection Notice, the Representative
and the Buyer shall engage the Independent Auditor to resolve any remaining
dispute. The Independent Auditor shall within the thirty (30) day period
immediately following referral of the QP WC Reconciliation to the Independent
Auditor, make the final determination of the QP WC Reconciliation in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Buyer and the Representative
shall each provide the Independent Auditor with their
respective determinations of the QP WC Reconciliation; provided that such
determinations may not differ to the detriment of the other party from the QP
WC Reconciliation delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.7(a) or the
Objection Notice, as applicable. The Independent Auditor shall make an
independent determination of the QP WC Reconciliation that, assuming
compliance with the previous clause, shall be final and binding on the
Sellers, the Representative and the Buyer; provided that for the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Auditor shall in no event modify the QP WC Adjustment
or the QP Closing Balance Sheet. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Independent Auditor shall be paid by the party whose QP WC Reconciliation was
different by the greater amount from that of the Independent Auditor.

(d) The QP WC Reconciliation shall be paid by the Buyer or the Representative,
as applicable, within two (2) Business Days following the Settlement Date, an
amount equal to the QP WC Reconciliation. The Sellers hereby acknowledge and
agree that receipt of (i) the portion of the Estimated Purchase Price by
the Representative as set forth in Section 2.2, (ii) the payment, if any, due
from Buyer to the Representative pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and (iii) the
payment, if any, due from Buyer to the Representative pursuant to
this Section 2.7(d) shall be deemed to satisfy Buyers obligation to deliver
the Purchase Price to the Sellers hereunder.

the Group at and after the Closing.

Business Days of the Closing Date the Buyer shall cause each entity within the
Acquired Group to amend their respective Charter Documents to remove the
name "Clearview" or "Northstar", as applicable, therefrom and shall cause the
appropriate filings to be made in Delaware to give effect to such amendments.
The Buyer shall provide to the Representative proof of the approval
and acceptance of such amendments by the Delaware Secretary of State within
three (3) Business Days of the receipt of such proof from the Delaware

(b) _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(i) The Charter Documents of each entity within the Acquired Group after
Closing shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
elimination or limitation of liability and indemnification than are set forth
in the Charter Documents of each entity within the Acquired Group as of the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Closing Date, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries, or agents of any entity within the Acquired Group.

(ii) Immediately after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause each entity within
the Acquired Group to obtain and pay for in full for the benefit of the
directors and officers who are currently covered by the Acquired Groups
existing directors and officers liability insurance (the "Indemnified
Directors and Officers") "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Closing Date with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Acquired Groups existing policies for claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the Closing Date. The cost of such "tail"
insurance policy shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand.

 



64 (iii) In the event any entity within the Acquired Group or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into

entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
the Buyer agrees that proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of such entity within the Acquired Group, as the case may be,
shall succeed to the obligations of the Buyer set forth in this Section
8.2(b).

(iv) The rights of each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers under this
Section 8.2(b) shall be in addition to any right such Person might have under
the respective Charter Documents of each entity within the Acquired Group, or
under any agreement or insurance policies applicable to the
Indemnified Director or Officer. The provisions of this Section 8.2(b) shall
survive the Closing Date and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers and their
respective heirs and assigns.

8.3. _Mutual Covenants_. The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with each
other with respect to the following: 

(a) _Satisfaction of Conditions_. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer,
on the other, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligation of the other to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If a partys (the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand) conditions to
Closing as set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2, as applicable, have been met and
such party nevertheless refuses to consummate the Closing, the other party
shall be entitled to specific enforcement in any court of applicable
jurisdiction without the posting of any bond or other security to compel the
party refusing to consummate the Closing and such other equitable remedies and
Losses as such court shall determine.

 

(b) _Public Statements_. During the period prior to Closing, before the Buyer,
the Sellers or any entity within the Acquired Group shall release any
information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
which is intended for or may result in public dissemination thereof, such
party shall furnish drafts of all documents or proposed oral statements to
the other party, for comments, and shall not release any such information
without the written Consent of Buyer or the Representative, as applicable.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent any party hereto from releasing any
such information if required to do so by Law or pursuant to any rule or
regulation of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any
national stock exchange.

 

(c) _Claims by Qualspec LLC under the Insurance Policies_. Qualspec LLC has
claims against the insurance companies under the Insurance Policies with
respect to the Settled Matter, which claims may not be resolved prior to the
Closing. If such claims are not resolved prior to the Closing, the Buyer
agrees that (i) it will in good faith allow the executive  

 



65  officers of Qualspec LLC that are Sellers to continue to pursue such claims
so long as such pursuit does not unreasonably interfere with the performance
of any such executive officers duties and responsibilities in connection
with their employment by any entity within the Acquired Group, Buyer and any
of their Affiliates, and (ii) that any Insurance Proceeds up to $12.5 million
paid to Qualspec LLC with respect to the Settled Matter under the Insurance
Policies shall be remitted to the Representative within five (5) Business Days
of receipt thereof by Qualspec LLC. The Sellers shall be responsible for all
third party costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by any entity within the Acquired Group, their Affiliates or any such
executive officer in pursuing such claims and the Representative shall
reimburse each entity within the Acquired Group and its Affiliates for such
costs and expenses within five (5) Business Days of delivery of invoices
therefor to the Representative.

 

(d) _Taxes_.

 

(i) The Representative shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or
cause to be filed) on a timely basis (taking into account valid extensions of
time to file) all Tax Returns of each entity within the Acquired Group that
are due on or before the Closing Date, and all income and franchise Tax
Returns of each entity within the Acquired Group that are due after
the Closing Date for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects,
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the similar Tax Returns for the
immediately preceding taxable period, and shall not make, amend, revoke or
terminate any Tax election or change any accounting practice or procedure
without the prior written consent of the Buyer. The Representative shall give
a copy of each such Tax Return to the Buyer at least thirty (30) days prior
to filing for its review and comment and shall not file any such return
without the prior written consent of Buyer. The Sellers (prior to the Closing)
and the Buyer (following the Closing) shall cause each entity within the
Acquired Group to cooperate in connection with the preparation and filing of
such Tax Returns and, to the extent not taken into account in computing Net
Working Capital, the Sellers shall timely pay the Tax shown to be due thereon
and furnish the Buyer proof of such payment. Unless the Buyer provides
otherwise at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (without extension)
of the federal income Tax Return of Qualspec Holdings and Northstar GP for the
short tax year ending on the Closing Date or such elections have already been
made, the applicable Sellers and Representative shall cause each of Qualspec
Holdings and Northstar GP to make an election under Code Section 754 (and any
corresponding election under state, local and non-U.S. law) on such Tax
Returns and each of the parties hereby agree to provide any and all the
necessary consents to make such election.

 

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to
be filed) on a timely basis (taking into account valid extensions of time to
file) all Tax Returns of each entity within the Acquired Group that are not
required to be filed under subparagraph (i). Any such Tax Returns for a period
ending on or before the Closing Date or that includes the Closing Date shall
be true, correct and complete in all material respects, shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with

 



66  the similar Tax Returns for the immediately preceding taxable period, and
shall not make, amend, revoke or terminate and tax election or change any
accounting practice or procedure without the prior consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(iii) Following the Closing, the Representative shall not amend or cause to
be amended any Tax Return of any entity within the Acquired Group for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of the Buyer. The Buyer shall cause each entity within the Acquired
Group to cooperate in connection with the preparation and filing of such
amended Tax Returns and any Tax Proceeding in connection therewith, and permit
the Representative to control any such Tax Proceeding (as well as any other
Tax Proceeding relating to a Pre-Closing Period). The cost of preparing and
filing such amended Tax Returns shall be borne by the Sellers.

 

(iv) The applicable Sellers shall be entitled to any refund or credit of Tax
received by any entity within the Acquired Group after the Closing Date with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period, to the extent such amount exceeds the amount
set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet. The Buyer shall pay to the
Representative in cash, an amount equal to any such refund or credit of
Tax, within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt by any entity within the
Acquired Group. Any such payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 

(v) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall not cause or permit any entity
within the Acquired Group to file a Tax Return with respect to a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date (or amend a Tax Return filed
pursuant to clause (ii) above after the Closing with respect to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date) without the Representatives
prior consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(vi) The Buyer shall retain (or cause each entity within the Acquired Group
to retain) all Books and Records with respect to Tax matters for Pre-Closing
Periods at least until 180 days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, including any extensions or waivers thereof, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into by or with respect to any entity
within the Acquired Group with any Governmental Entity. Prior to disposing of
or destroying any such Books and Records, the Buyer shall offer them to the
Representative.

(vii) The Sellers and Buyer shall be equally liable for all sales, use and
other transfer Taxes arising from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyer shall prepare all Tax Returns relating to such Taxes,
shall give a copy of each such Tax Return to the Representative at least
thirty (30) days prior to filing for its review and comment, and shall
consider in good faith any changes that are requested by the Representative.
The Buyer shall timely file such Tax Returns and timely remit to the
appropriate Governmental Entity any Taxes shown to be due thereon, and shall
give a copy of such Tax Returns to the

 



67  Representative promptly after filing, together with proof of payment of such
Taxes. Sellers shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns if required
by applicable Law and shall pay, or cause the Representative to pay, to Buyer
their portion of any Taxes provided herein no later than five (5) days prior
to the filing of the applicable Tax Returns.

 

(viii) The tax year of the Company will terminate for federal income tax
purposes at the end of the Closing Date. The tax year of Qualspec Holdings
and Northstar GP will terminate for federal income tax purposes under Code
Section 708(b)(1)(B) at the end of the Closing Date. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the parties shall elect (and shall cause each
entity within the Acquired Group to elect) to treat the taxable period that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date with respect to any Tax of any
entity within the Acquired Group as ending at the end of the Closing Date, and
shall take such steps as may be necessary therefor. If such an election
cannot be made, for purposes of this Agreement, any Tax for a taxable period
that includes but that does not end on the Closing Date shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Period and the balance of the taxable period based on
an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ , that any real or personal property Tax, fixed dollar franchise Tax
and any annual exemption amount shall be allocated based on the relative
number of days in the Pre-Closing Period and the balance of the taxable
period.

(ix) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving any entity within the Acquired Group shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing, each of such entities shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

(x) The Buyer shall include Qualspec Inc. and the Blockers in a consolidated
federal income tax return with the Buyer for its first tax period that ends
after the Closing Date. As a result, the tax year of Qualspec Inc. and the
Blockers will terminate for federal income tax purposes at the end of the
Closing Date.

 

8.4. _Acknowledgement by the Buyer; Disclaimers_.

 

(a) The Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the financial condition, operations, assets,
liabilities and properties of the Acquired Group and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Buyer has relied and will rely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties of the Sellers with
respect to their respective authority to enter into this Agreement and their
respective ownership of their Equity Interests expressly and specifically set
forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to all materials that are described as having been made
available or delivered to the Buyer, such materials shall be deemed to have
been delivered or made available to the Buyer if the Buyer or agents have been
granted access to a data room, electronic data room or website in which such
materials were available or by transmitting such materials to the Buyer or
agents by any other electronic means.

 



68 (c) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH
IN ARTICLES 3 AND 4 CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS TO THE BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND THE BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED (INCLUDING, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL
CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR PROSPECTS OF ANY OF
THE SELLERS), ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY THE SELLERS.

 

(d) In connection with the Buyers investigation of the Acquired Group, the
Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Acquired Group certain
projections and business plan information for future periods of time. The
Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, that the Buyer is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such projections and forecasts), and that the
Buyer shall have no Claim against the Sellers or any other Person with respect
thereto except to the extent any of the representations or warranties set
forth in Articles 3 or 4 have been breached and then in accordance with
Article 10. None of the Sellers makes any representations or warranties
whatsoever with respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
projections and forecasts).

(a) Each of the Buyer and the Representative has filed a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission

the contrary herein, neither the Buyer nor any entity within the Acquired
Group, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to divest or
agree to divest, sell, license, dispose of or hold separate, alter any
business or commercial practice or operate in any specified manner any assets
or business in connection with any applicable antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law.

setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and

however, that materials may be redacted as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or confidentiality concerns.

deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 8.4 as
"outside counsel only"; _provided, however_ , that materials concerning the
valuation of the Business may be redacted. Materials designated as for
"outside counsel only" and the information contained therein shall be given

(No Conflict) and Section 5.1(f) (Brokerage) to be true and correct in all
respects as of the date made and (ii) the breach of any of Buyers covenants
and agreements hereunder.

 

10.2. _Limitations on Indemnification_. The indemnification obligations set
forth in Sections 10.1(a) through (e) of each indemnifying party shall be
limited to the amount of the Purchase Price received by such indemnifying
party.

10.3.  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any indemnified party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Claim by a third party made against such
indemnified party ("Third Party Claim") with respect to which the indemnifying
party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written
notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the indemnifying party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that such
failure causes the indemnifying party to forfeit rights or defenses. Such
notice by the indemnified party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the indemnified
party. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the indemnified party, to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim at the indemnifying partys expense and by the indemnifying
partys own counsel, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in
good faith in such defense; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the
indemnifying party is a Seller, such indemnifying party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks
non-monetary relief. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any
Third Party Claim, subject to Section 10.3(b), it shall have the right to take
such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the indemnifying partys right to control the defense thereof.
The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
indemnified party, _provided_ _,_ _that_ if in the good faith judgment of the
indemnified party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an indemnified
party that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party that cannot be waived, the
indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party elects not to
defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the indemnified party
in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails
to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party may, subject to Section 10.3(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.

 



73 (b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the indemnifying party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party,
except as provided in this Section 10.3(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim that (i) requires solely the payment of monetary damages
that will be paid by the indemnifying party, (ii) does not include any finding
or admission of any violation of any Law or any rights of any third party,
(iii) does not create a financial or other obligation on the part of the
indemnified party or any sanction or restriction that could adversely affect
the business or any injunction or other equitable relief of such indemnified
party or any of its Affiliates, and (iv) provides, in customary form, for the
full and unconditional release of each indemnified party from all other
claims, liabilities and obligations that may be made against the indemnified
party in connection with such Third Party Claim, and the indemnifying party
desires to accept and agree to such offer, then the indemnifying party shall
give written notice to that effect to the indemnified party. If the
indemnified party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10)
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the indemnified party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the indemnifying party as to such Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the indemnified party has
assumed the defense pursuant to Section 10.3(a), it shall be permitted to
settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the indemnifying
party.

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Claim by an indemnified party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the indemnified party giving the indemnifying party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the indemnified party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that such failure causes the indemnifying party to forfeit rights or
defenses. Such notice by the indemnified party shall describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail, shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the indemnified
party. The indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt
of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The indemnified
party shall allow the indemnifying party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the indemnified party shall assist the indemnifying partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including reasonable
access to the indemnified partys premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records upon reasonable notice and
during business hours) as the indemnifying party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the indemnifying party does not so respond
within such thirty (30) day period, the indemnifying party shall be deemed to
have rejected such claim, in which case the indemnified party shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to the indemnified party on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) After any final Order shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration
board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding Agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any

 



74  sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all
of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of
such notice.

(e) In the case of any amount payable to any indemnified party pursuant to
this Article 10, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the Claim shall be satisfied as
follows, subject to the other provisions of this Article 10:

(i) Each party claiming indemnification shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Losses and shall reasonably consult with the
indemnifying party with the intention of mitigating any Losses in conjunction
with any Claims for indemnification is sought pursuant to this Article 10;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 10.3(e) shall imply or
create any obligation of or duty upon any indemnified party to incur any costs
or expenses in mitigating Losses or consulting with the indemnifying party in
connection therewith;

(ii) No Claim with respect to a Loss shall be made under this Article 10 to
the extent such Loss is specifically included in the determination of Net
Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.3.

 

(iii) In the case of any amount payable to an indemnified party the
indemnifying party shall pay all of the sums so due and owing to the
indemnified parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice;

 

(iv) Except in the case of actual fraud, Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section
2.6, Section 2.7 and Section 12.13(d), the indemnification relief afforded by
the provisions of this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of a
party seeking indemnification for matters arising under this Agreement. By
agreeing to such provisions, the parties are deemed to have made an election
of remedies in favor of indemnification in lieu of other remedies;

(f) The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article 10 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

10.4. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the parties referenced in Section 10.1 hereof shall survive for
a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date.

 

10.5. _Materiality Qualifiers_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, for purposes of the indemnification obligations under this
Article 10, all of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or any certificate or schedule that are qualified by "material,"
"materially," "material respects," "material adverse effect," "Material
Adverse Change" or words of similar import or effect shall be deemed to have
been made without any such qualification for purposes of determining (a) other
than with respect to Sections 3B.3, 3C.3 and 3D.3, whether a breach of any
such representation or warranty has occurred and (b) the amount of Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach of
representation or warranty.

 



75 ARTICLE 11

 

TERMINATION

11.1.  _Termination of Agreement_. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
terminated:

 

(a) _Agreement_. By mutual consent in writing of the Buyer and the
Representative;

 

(b) _By the Buyer_. By the Buyer: (i) upon written notice to the
Representative if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not
been consummated on or prior to July 31, 2015, unless such failure of
consummation shall be due to the failure of the Buyer to perform or observe in
all material respects the covenants and agreements hereof to be performed or
observed by the Buyer; or (ii) if any of the Sellers have breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect, the Buyer has notified the Representative of the breach, and
the breach has continued without cure for a period of ten (10) Business Days
after the notice of breach; or

(c) _By the Representative_. By the Representative; (i) upon written notice
to the Buyer if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been
consummated on or prior to July 31, 2015, unless such failure of consummation

observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements hereof to be
performed or observed by such Seller; or (ii) if the Buyer has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement in any
material respect such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) is not
capable of being satisfied, the Representative has notified the Buyer of the
breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of ten (10)
Business Days after the notice of breach.

11.2. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant
to Section 11.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate without further liability of any party to the other;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any party may pursue any Claim that it may
have as a result of a breach by another party of any covenant under this
Agreement and (ii) the obligations of the parties contained in Section 12.3
hereof shall survive any such termination.

agent and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act, including
full power of substitution, in its name and on its behalf with respect to all
matters arising from or in any way relating to this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, to
(i) represent, act for and on behalf of, and bind each of the Sellers in the
performance of all of their obligations arising from or relating to
this Agreement, including any certificate or Contract required under this
Agreement to be delivered by the Representative at the Closing (ii) accept
delivery from the Buyer of any proceeds or amounts payable pursuant to this

Law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Sellers that is an individual,
termination of any trust or estate, the dissolution, liquidation or bankruptcy
of any corporation, partnership or other entity or the occurrence of any
other event, and any action taken by the Representative shall be as valid as
if such death, incapacity, termination, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy
or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the
Representative shall have received any notice thereof. The Representative
hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform its obligations under,
and otherwise comply with, this Section 12.13.

 



79 (b) The Representative shall not have any authority to represent or act on
behalf of any Seller against whom the Buyer has made a Claim for
indemnification that is particular to such Seller and does not relate to a
similar Claim against any other Seller, and all matters related to any such
Claim shall be handled directly by the applicable Seller and the Buyer.

(c) _Reliance_. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative shall constitute a decision of the Sellers and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent, notice or instruction of the Representative as being
the decision, act, consent, notice or instruction of the Sellers. The
Representative cannot be changed or substituted without the prior written
consent of a majority in interest of the Sellers and such change or
substitution of the Representative shall not be effective until the Buyer
receives written notice thereof from the Representative.

(d) _Indemnification of Buyer_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
liable for any Losses to any party, including any Seller, for any action taken
or not taken by the Representative or for any action taken, or omission to
take any action, in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or decisions,
acts, consents, notices or instructions made, given or executed by the
Representative, including the failure of the Representative to distribute any
payments made to the Representative or otherwise for distribution to any
Seller, among the Sellers or any other party (it being understood that once
such a payment is made to the Representative, such payment shall constitute a
complete discharge of the relevant payment obligation of the Buyer). Each
Seller (with respect to its Pro Rata Portion and subject to the provisions of
Section 10.2) agrees to pay, indemnify and hold harmless, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, in connection with
or arising out of any action taken, or omission to take any action, by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties in reliance upon actions taken or not taken or
decisions, acts, consents, notices or instructions made, given or executed by
the Representative. In addition, each Seller hereby releases and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any
Losses arising out of or in connection with the Representatives failure to
distribute any amounts received by the Representative on behalf of any
Seller, among the Sellers or any other party.
