3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(f) Merger Sub may (and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right of Merger

cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase and pay for any and all shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer and
shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Sub's covenants, agreements
and obligations in respect of the Offer and this Agreement, in each case to

(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger
Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the

Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal, form of summary
advertisement and such other customary documents as the Company and Parent may

together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents")
and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall cause the Offer
Documents and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto filed by either

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC
and to promptly be disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Merger Sub or

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

in the Offer Documents, all information reasonably requested by Parent and
reasonably available to the Company concerning the Company and the Company's
shareholders that may be required in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 1.1(h) to be included in the Offer Documents, including in
connection with communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders
of the shares of Common Stock. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any
amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In addition,
Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of
any oral comments or other communications. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any written
responses and to participate in any oral responses and Parent shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes, as
applicable, suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

  

  

(i) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub all of the funds necessary
to purchase any shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender any shares of Common Stock held by
them into the Offer.

  

  

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that
this Agreement and the Transactions are in the best interests of the Company's
shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions in accordance with the requirements of the Texas Act, and (iii)
resolved, subject to Sections 1.2 and 6.4, to recommend that shareholders of
the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer and, if necessary, under applicable Laws, adopt this Agreement
(such recommendation set forth in this clause (iii) the "Company Board
Recommendation"). Subject to Sections 1.2(b) and 1.2(c), the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation
in the Offer Documents.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in Sections 1.2(c) and 6.4, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board
Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal or
(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose or resolve to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Contract constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would be reasonably likely to lead to,
any Takeover Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
Section 6.4), or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate the
Transactions (any action described in clause (i) or (ii) being referred to as
an "Adverse Change Recommendation").

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to Merger Sub accepting, for the first time, for payment the
shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the "Offer Acceptance Time"),
the Company Board may make an Adverse Change Recommendation (in connection
with a Takeover Proposal or otherwise) if and only if: (i) the Company shall
not have breached Section 6.4 in connection with such Adverse Change
Recommendation; (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Laws; (iii) Parent
shall have received from the Company prior written notice of the Company's
intention to make an Adverse Change Recommendation at least five (5) Business
Days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation (a "Change of
Recommendation Notice"); (iv) if the Adverse Change Recommendation is made in
connection with a Takeover Proposal and the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith and after consultation with its financial advisor,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company
shall have complied with clauses (A) through (C) as follows: (A) the Company
shall have provided to Parent the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal and such other facts included in such Takeover Proposal as
would be material to an evaluation of such Takeover Proposal, (B) the Company
shall have given Parent five (5) Business Days after Parent's receipt of the
Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make other proposals and shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate with Parent) with respect
to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, so that the Takeover
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) after
considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that
such Takeover Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make the Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Laws. Issuance of any
"stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company which
does no more than comply with the requirements of Rule 14d-9(f) and any other
action (unless the substance thereof makes such action an Adverse Change
Recommendation) taken by the Company in compliance with Rules 14a-9, 14e-2 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not in
and of itself be considered an Adverse Change Recommendation that requires the
giving of a Change of Recommendation Notice or compliance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 1.2(c). Neither the Company nor the Company Board
shall be permitted to recommend that the Company shareholders tender any
securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer or otherwise
approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal, unless in each case, in
connection therewith, the Company Board effects an Adverse Change
Recommendation in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of a material
amendment to a Takeover Proposal that has already been subject to the
procedures of Section 1.2(c)(iv), such Takeover Proposal shall again be
subject to such procedures, provided that the period of negotiation given to
Parent shall be three (3) Business Days after Parent's receipt of written
notice from the Company, provided that in no event shall the aggregate period
of negotiation for any Takeover Proposal (including any amendments thereto)
exceed fifteen (15) Business Days. After such period ends, Parent will have 24
hours to discuss the revised Takeover Proposal with the Company before the
Company Board may make an Adverse Change Recommendation.

  

  

(d) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
shares of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to Sections 1.2 and
6.4, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that
it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to promptly be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of shares of
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC (other than any amendment effecting an Adverse
Change Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement). The Company agrees
to provide Parent and its counsel with a written copy of any comments the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments and any written
responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of any oral comments or other
communications. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon any written responses and to participate in any
oral responses and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes, as applicable, suggested thereto by Parent
and its counsel.

  

  

(e) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Parent with a list of the Company's record shareholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names
and addresses of all record holders of shares of Common Stock, any non-
objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listings of securities
positions of record holders of shares of Common Stock held in stock
depositories, in each case, to the Company's knowledge, true and correct as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with communicating

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of shares of Common Stock.
Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use
their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or
destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control or under the control of any of their
representatives or agents in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

Section 1.3 Directors.

  

  

(a) Promptly upon the Offer Acceptance Time and all times thereafter, subject
to compliance with applicable Laws and the applicable Marketplace Rules of The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"), Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the board of
directors of the Company as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the board of directors of the Company (after giving effect to the
directors designated by Merger Sub pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by
(ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock at
such time beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates
bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock then issued and
outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the terms "beneficial ownership" (and
its correlative terms) shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub's request at
any time following the Offer Acceptance Time, take all such actions necessary
to (A) appoint to the Company Board the individuals designated by Merger Sub
and permitted to be so designated by the first sentence of this Section
1.3(a), including, but not limited to, promptly filling vacancies or newly
created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size of
the Company Board (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if
necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable to enable Merger Sub's designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, and (B) cause Merger Sub's designees to be so
appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon Merger Sub's request following
the Offer Acceptance Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Merger
Sub to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as
is on the Company Board of each committee of the board of directors of the
Company to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the NASDAQ Marketplace
Rules. The Company's obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.3(a), including mailing to shareholders the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 not later than such time as
is necessary to enable Merger Sub's designees to be designated to the Company
Board at the Offer Acceptance Time. Merger Sub shall and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to supply the Company with, and be solely responsible for,
information with respect to Merger Sub's designees and Parent's and Merger
Sub's respective officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of
Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a record
holder or beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock as a matter of applicable
Laws with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

  

  

(b) In the event that Merger Sub's designees are designated to the Company
Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause the Company Board to maintain three (3) directors who are members
of the Company Board on the date hereof and who are not officers, directors or
employees of Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates, each of whom
shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Company's audit committee under
the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (the "Continuing Directors"),
and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K; provided, however,
that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below three for any
reason, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a
committee of the Company Board) so that the remaining Continuing Director(s)
shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill
such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then
remains, the other directors on the board of directors of the Company shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their affiliates, each of whom shall be an
"independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace
Rules and eligible to serve on the Company's audit committee under the
Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and at least one of whom shall be
an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and
(iii) of Regulation S-K, to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be
deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Merger Sub's
designees constitute a majority of the board of directors of the Company after
the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or in the case
where there are two or fewer Continuing Directors, the concurrence of all
Continuing Directors) shall (in addition to the approval rights of the board
of directors of the Company or the shareholders of the Company as may be
required by the Company Organizational Documents or applicable Laws) be
required (i) for the Company to amend, modify or terminate this Agreement,
(ii) for the Company to extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, (iii) to exercise
or waive any of the Company's rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (iv) for
any amendment to the Company Organizational Documents that adversely affects
or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the stockholders of the
Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates), (v) for
any Adverse Recommendation Change or (vi) to take any other action of the
Company Board under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would
adversely affect (in a non-de minimis manner), or would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect (in a non-de minimis manner), the holders of shares of
Common Stock (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates);
provided, however, such affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall in no event be required for the consummation of the Top-Up
Option or the Merger in accordance with this

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the
Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may
include current counsel to the Company or the Company Board) in reasonable
circumstances and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the
Company's rights hereunder, in each case until the Closing. Following the
Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, unless required by
applicable Law or applicable fiduciary duties or for removal for good cause,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to remove any Continuing
Director.

  

  

Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an option (the "Top-Up
Option") to purchase from the Company the number of shares of Common Stock
(such shares, the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lesser of (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares
of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of
all shares of Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option on a fully diluted
basis or (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Company
is authorized to issue under its articles of incorporation, but that are not
issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for, reserved for issuance or
otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the Offer Price. The
Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective
Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub once in whole
and not in part on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later of the
Offer Acceptance Time and the expiration of any subsequent offering period
pursuant to Section 1.1(f), if applicable, if at such time, Parent, Merger Sub
or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub do not own in the aggregate at least
90% of the total shares of Common Stock then outstanding; provided, however,
that the obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Option Shares is
subject to the conditions that (i) no judgment, injunction, order or decree of
any Governmental Authority shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise; and (ii)
Merger Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all shares of Common Stock
validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. Upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, subject to Article VII, Parent covenants to cause the Closing to occur
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares.

  

  

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in cash of no less than
$0.01 per share and payment of the balance by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note (with full recourse to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Parent) having a principal amount equal to the difference between the purchase
price and the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares or (iii) any
combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the
applicable federal rate as determined for U.S. income tax purposes, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

  

  

(d) Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a written notice setting
forth (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that will be owned by Parent
and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares
together with the number of Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) the manner in which
Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii)
the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares is to take place, which shall take place not later than five (5)
Business Days following the Offer Acceptance Time or the expiration of any
subsequent offering period pursuant to Section 1.1(f). The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in no event later
than the Top-Up Option closing date), notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing
of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the number of
Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered
to Parent or Merger Sub (as the case may be) a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at Parent's or Merger Sub's request
or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated shares of Common
Stock, the applicable number of non-certificated shares of Common Stock
represented by Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares of
Common Stock may include any legends required by applicable Laws. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option
granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be assigned by Parent or Merger
Sub except in connection with an assignment in compliance with Section 9.14.
Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 1.4(d) shall be null and
void.

  

  

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

ARTICLE III

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 3.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the
Company:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock,

Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Common Stock owned or held in treasury by the Company or any of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall be canceled
automatically without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or distribution shall be paid or made for those Excluded Shares.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Common Stock.

  

  

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

  

  

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to Section
3.1(c)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of (A) certificates which immediately before the Effective Time
represented such shares (the "Certificates") or (B) shares represented by
book-entry (the "Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with
respect to those shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2 and any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Equitable Adjustment. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) is
declared with a record date during such period, then the Offer Price and
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

  

  

Section 3.2 Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Not less than three Business Days before the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company
in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the
"Paying Agent") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying
Agent, the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to the Company in
its reasonable discretion. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses of the Paying Agent.

  

  

(b) Payment Fund. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, Company Options, Company
RSU Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards, for payment in accordance with
this Article III through the Paying Agent, sufficient funds for the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under Article
III. Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the "Payment
Fund."

  

  

(c) Payment Procedures.

  

  

(i) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common Stock
converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i), (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holder's shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and (B)
instructions for surrendering such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Such instructions shall provide that:
(1) at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates may be
surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise and (2) the Merger Consideration
payable in exchange for Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares will be payable
by check or transfer by wire transfer to the surrendering holder.

  

  

(ii) Surrender of Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay in
exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number
of shares formerly evidenced by that Certificate or Book-Entry Share less any
required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Shares so surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue
or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

  

  

(iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to
such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by Parent to
evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment
(1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that any such transfer Taxes have
already been paid or are not applicable.

  

  

(iv) No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
3.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, subject to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Any Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by it.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such affidavit
claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger
Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

  

  

(e) No Further Transfers. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) Required Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the "Code"), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made
for all purposes under this Agreement. To the extent that Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, becomes
aware of any applicable withholding Taxes, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent (i) shall provide prompt written notice to the
holders of Common Stock immediately

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

prior to the Effective Time of the amount of such Tax, (ii) shall consult with
the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in good
faith as to the nature of the Tax and the basis upon which such withholding is
required and (iii) shall promptly provide any such Person any additional
documentation required for such Person's Tax filings, as may be reasonably
requested by such Person. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain exemptions from, or reductions of, any Taxes required to be withheld
from payments under this Agreement.

  

  

(g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(h) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent; provided, that such investment shall be in obligations
of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United States
of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing solely
in such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk,
of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such investment
shall be for the benefit of Parent; provided, that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of any such losses
to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Article III.

  

  

(i) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon
demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has
not complied with this Article III shall look only to Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, which shall remain responsible for payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 3.3 Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company Restricted Stock
Awards.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of an option to acquire shares
of Common Stock (each, a "Company Option"), each Company Option outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested (including Company Options that become exercisable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
promptly following the Effective Time an amount in cash, without

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired upon
exercise of such Company Option, immediately before the Effective Time;
provided, that if the per share exercise or purchase price of any such Company
Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. "Option Consideration" means the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable
Company Option.

  

  

(b) At the Offer Acceptance Time, by virtue of the consummation of the Offer
and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of a
restricted stock unit that conveys the right to receive shares of Common Stock
(each, a "Company RSU Award"), each Company RSU Award outstanding immediately
before the Offer Acceptance Time shall, in accordance with its terms, be
vested and the Company shall deliver shares of Common Stock to the holder
thereof in settlement of each such vested Company RSU Award in accordance with
the terms of such Company RSU Award. At the Effective Time, each share of
Common Stock issued in respect of the vested Company RSU Award (that has not
otherwise been tendered in the Offer or in any subsequent offering period)
shall have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each
share of Company Stock described in Section 3.1(c) above.

  

  

(c) At the Offer Acceptance Time, by virtue of the consummation of the Offer
without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of a
Company Restricted Stock Award (hereinafter defined), the restrictions
applicable to each share of restricted Common Stock (each, a "Company
Restricted Stock Award") that has been granted and has not yet vested
immediately before the Offer Acceptance Time, including both time-based
vesting awards and performance-based vesting awards, will be fully vested in
accordance with its terms. Each vested Company Restricted Stock Award that has
not otherwise been tendered in the Offer or in any subsequent offering period
will be treated at the Effective Time as, and have the same rights and be
subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Stock described in
Section 3.1(c) above.

  

  

(d) The payment of the amounts set forth in Section 3.3(a) in respect of the
Company Options shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding
required under the Code or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing
authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder
of that Company Option for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company
shall take all action such that Company RSU Awards shall be settled in
accordance with these terms and that all Company Options shall be canceled and
the Company Stock Plan shall terminate at the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (i) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions as may be required to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3 and (ii) shall, as
applicable, mail to each holder of Company Options and Company RSU Awards a
letter describing the treatment of and payment for, as applicable, such
Company Options or Company RSU

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Awards pursuant to this Section 3.3 and providing instructions for use in
obtaining payment for such Company Options or Company RSU Awards (which
instructions shall provide that the cash payable to such holder pursuant to
this Section 3.3 may be, at the election of such holder, mailed to such holder
or transferred to such holder by wire transfer). Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time
maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their obligations to holders of
Company Options pursuant to this Section 3.3.

  

  

(f) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail a check (or transfer by wire
transfer) to each applicable holder of a Company Option, in such amount due
and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 3.3(a) in respect of such
Company Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the payments
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may direct the Paying Agent to pay the Surviving Corporation (or
its designees) for (but only to the extent of) any amounts the Surviving
Corporation elects to pay to each holder of a Company Option in respect of the
consideration payable therefor plus any amounts deducted and withheld with
respect to any such amounts.

  

  

(g) In addition to the payment of the amounts set forth in Section 3.3(a),
Section 3.3(b), Section 3.3(c) and Section 3.3(d), the Surviving Corporation
and/or Parent shall pay at the Closing, by check or direct deposit, all
accrued dividends and other distributions (including dividend equivalents) in
respect of all Company RSU Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards with a
record date prior to the Effective Time which have been authorized by the
Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time as set forth on Section
3.3(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

Section 3.4 Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.4), any shares of Common
Stock for which the holder thereof (i) is entitled to dissenter and appraisal
rights under the Texas Act and (ii) has demanded payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the
applicable provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the Texas Act
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(c). At the
Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist
and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights
as may be granted to them under the Texas Act.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses the rights of a "dissenting
owner" (as such term is used in Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the Texas Act)
(through failure to perfect such rights or otherwise), then that holder's
shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be
treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, in each
case in accordance with Section 3.2.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any written demands for
payment of the fair value of any shares of Common Stock, the withdrawals of
such demands and any other instrument served on the Company under Subchapter H
of Chapter 10 of the Texas Act, (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for payment of the
fair value of any such shares of Common Stock, and (iii) after the Effective
Time, the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
thereto. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall
not offer to make or make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands for payment of the fair value of any such shares of
Common Stock without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If any appraisal is made
of Dissenting Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the
Effective Time, then the cash received and/or value of the promissory note
received by the Company in payment of the exercise price of the Top-Up Option
shall be treated as if it were not paid to or received by the Company and the
Top-Up Shares issued upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option shall be treated
as if they were not issued or outstanding in connection with the determination
of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Subchapter H of the Texas Act.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in (i) the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), it being agreed that disclosure
of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter (whether or not an
explicit cross reference appears) shall be deemed to be disclosure with
respect to any other section of the Company Disclosure Letter and any other
representation or warranty made elsewhere in Article IV, in each case, to the
extent the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure, or (ii) the Company SEC Reports (other than the Company SEC

is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability
company, limited partnership or other legal entity and is in good standing in

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.5(c) are true and
correct, the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter

Section 4.8 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The Company's authorized capital stock consists solely of (i) 50,000,000
shares of Common Stock and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without
par value (the "Preferred Stock"), which includes shares designated as Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, which shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock have been reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of preferred stock purchase rights (the "Company Rights") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of December 31,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2002, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent, as
amended by Amendment to Rights Agreement, dated as of October 10, 2008,
between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent (the "Company
Rights Agreement"). As of April 30, 2012 (the "Capitalization Date"), (A)
12,241,530 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including
215,838 Company Restricted Stock Awards), (B) no shares of Common Stock were
held in treasury by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) 45,574 shares
of Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of Company
Options, (D) 187,706 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the vesting of
187,706 issued and outstanding Company RSU Awards, and (E) no shares of
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Except as set forth above, as of
the date hereof, there are no shares of capital stock or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock
of the Company.

  

  

(b) Since the Capitalization Date, (i) there have been no issuances by the
Company of shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company,
except for issuances made in accordance with, and not in violation of, Article
VI, and (ii) there have been no issuances by the Company of Company
Compensatory Awards, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of capital
stock of the Company or interests representing or convertible into the right
to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except
for issuances made in accordance with, and not in violation of, Article VI.

  

  

(c) Section 4.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
correct list of all Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or
Company RSU Awards (in each case, "Company Compensatory Awards") and in each
case, the number of shares subject to the Company Compensatory Award, the date
of the grant and, in the case of the Company Stock Option, the price per share
at which such Company Stock Option may be exercised. There are no Company
Compensatory Awards outstanding that were not issued or granted, as
applicable, under the Company Stock Plan.

  

  

(d) Each grant of Company Compensatory Awards was validly issued in material
compliance with all applicable Law and approved by the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof). The exercise or purchase
price of each Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on the effective date of the corporate action
effectuating the grant of such Company Stock Option and no such Company Stock
Option provides for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i)(A). There are no outstanding
options or other rights to purchase shares of capital stock or other ownership
interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance awards or other benefits granted that are payable in
capital stock or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company,

Stock that are subject to issuance, upon issuance prior to the Effective

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Time in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions specified in
the instruments under which they are issuable (i) are, or upon issuance will
be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and (ii)
are not, or upon issuance will not be, subject to any pre-emptive rights.

  

  

(f) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company
that is a corporation is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and not subject to any pre-emptive rights.

  

  

(g) There is no Indebtedness of the Company convertible into, or exchangeable
for, capital stock or other equity interest of the Company ("Convertible
Company Debt"). Except for any obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company Stock Plan, the Company Rights Agreement or as otherwise set forth in
this Section 4.8, there are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units, Contracts or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any such
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity interest in, the
Company or any Convertible Company Debt or (ii) obligating the Company or any
such Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such option, warrant, right,
security, unit Contract or undertaking.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth in this Section 4.8, there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Common Stock or capital
stock of any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) to make any investment
(including in respect of any unsatisfied subscription obligation or capital
contribution or capital account funding obligation) in (A) any Subsidiary of
the Company that is not wholly-owned by the Company or (B) any other Person.

  

  

(i) There are no voting trusts, proxies or similar agreements, arrangements or
commitments to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other instruments
of indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that entitles the
holder of such instruments of indebtedness to vote together with shareholders
of the Company on any matters with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.9 Voting. Assuming that the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.5(c) are true and correct, if the
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's shareholders is required by Laws
in order to consummate the Merger, the Requisite Company Vote is the only vote
of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Company
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

subsequent Company SEC Reports, such Company SEC Reports (a) as of their
respective dates of filing, complied, and will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act"), the Exchange Act and other applicable Law and (b) did not
and will not, at the time they were filed, or if amended or restated, at the
time of such later amendment or restatement, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein

circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any periodic forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC.

  

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
filings with the SEC. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof,
none of the Company filings with the SEC is the subject of ongoing SEC review
and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding the Company
filings with the SEC or regarding any accounting or disclosure practices of
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.11 Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Whistleblower.

  

  

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
(including any related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports:

  

  

(i) (x) complied as to form in all material respects with the rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, and (y) were prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied
on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes to those

statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to the absence of
information or notes not required by GAAP to be included in the interim
financial statements; and

  

  

(ii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (except, in the case of any unaudited interim financial

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The Company maintains, and at all times since September 30, 2009 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, and, such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective and the Company's independent
registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified)
an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011.

  

  

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since September 30, 2009 has
maintained, disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably effective to ensure that all material information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the Company's
periodic reports under the Exchange Act is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and such disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably effective in timely alerting the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to such
information required to be included in the Company's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information in any material respect and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls.

  

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not, pursuant to the
procedures established by the Company for receiving such communications,
received any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or its internal accounting controls (except for any of
the foregoing which had no reasonable basis or has been resolved).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26

respect) or forgiven personal loans to any executive officer or director of
the Company.

against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including by virtue of
indemnification or otherwise) or their respective assets of properties, or any

by the Company or any Subsidiary in excess of $1,000,000, except for any such

Subsidiaries has disseminated in writing any legally binding commitment to
create or implement any additional employee benefit plan that would be a

federal, state, local and foreign Taxes required to be withheld in connection

business or the principal subject matter of which is not Taxes or liability
for Tax. Except for the U.S. affiliated group of which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are now currently members, since January 1, 2002, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group
of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code (or under a

Subsidiary of the Company does not file Tax Returns has ever claimed in
writing that the Company or that Subsidiary, as the case may be, is subject to
Liability for any material Taxes by that jurisdiction or is required to file a
material Tax Return in that jurisdiction, in each case which remains
unresolved.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34

material changes to the estimated net operating losses of the Company as
disclosed in Footnote 9 to the consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended September 30, 2011, which if made would not have an offsetting effect in
the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities.

  

  

(p) As of the sale of the Company\'s interest in WSI, the Company had tax
basis in its interest in WSI equal to at least $4,045,000.

warranties of the Company contained in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the

of the Offer or prevent Merger Sub from consummating the Merger.

made, other than would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(c) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default (with or

basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval of any
Governmental Authority necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall

Section 6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to (i) provide to
Parent and its Representatives access at reasonable times (including normal
business hours) upon prior notice to the officers, employees, properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish promptly
such information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request, including updates concerning the Material Litigation and
copies of all material pleadings or other material documents, in each case
that are filed with any applicable court, and copies of all material written
communications exchanged between the Company and any adverse party in the
Material Litigation with respect to such Material Litigation, and (iii) keep
Parent promptly informed of any material developments regarding the Material
Litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
to provide such access or disclosure to the extent it reasonably determines
that such access or disclosure would unreasonably damage the Company's
properties or assets or disrupt or unreasonably impair the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose information to the extent
such disclosure (A) would result in a waiver of or would reasonably be
expected to materially weaken a claim for attorney-client privilege,
settlement discussion privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege,
(B) would cause competitive harm to the business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated or (C) would violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality
obligation of such party existing as of the date hereof. No investigation
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to qualify,
modify or limit any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 22, 2011 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Company with respect to the information
disclosed under this Section 6.3.

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, rights to conduct or cause to be conducted any
invasive environmental testing or sampling of the current or former operations
or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Company in its sole discretion.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries' before the Offer Acceptance Time. Before the Offer Acceptance
Time, the Company shall,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, exercise complete
control and supervision over the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.4 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, and except as expressly
permitted by Section 1.2(c) or Section 6.4(b), the Company shall not, and the
Company shall cause any of its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall
instruct its Representatives acting on its behalf not to, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or
indications of interest regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover
Proposal; (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions (other than to
state that the Company is not permitted to have discussions) with any Person
that has made (A) a Takeover Proposal, with respect to such Takeover Proposal,
or (B) an inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Takeover Proposal, with respect to such Takeover Proposal; (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal; or (iv) enter into any
letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Takeover Transaction.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a), until the Offer Acceptance Time and
following the receipt by the Company of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal,
so long as the Company shall not have breached this Section 6.4 in connection
with such Takeover Proposal, (i) the Company Board shall be permitted to
participate in discussions regarding such Takeover Proposal solely to clarify
the terms of such Takeover Proposal and to enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the party making such Takeover Proposal and
(ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith (A) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) or (y) below with respect
to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (C) prior to furnishing any access or non-public
information to, or entering into discussions with the Person who has made such
Takeover Proposal, Parent receives written notice from the Company of the
identity of such Person and of the Company's intention to furnish access or
non-public information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, then
the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access and
non-public information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any written material non-public
information provided under this clause (x) has previously been made available
to Parent or is made available to Parent substantially concurrently with the
time it is made available to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions
and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board shall be permitted, to the
extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, to modify, waive,
amend or affirmatively release any existing standstill obligations owed by any
Person to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that concurrently with the
waiver, amendment or release of any standstill, the Company shall similarly
waive, amend or release Parent's standstill obligation. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Representatives shall be permitted, at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and without the requirement of having
first received an unsolicited Takeover Proposal, to waive any standstill
obligation owed by any Person to the Company to the extent necessary to allow
such Person to make a Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or
the taking of any action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth
in the Section 6.4 by the Company or any Representative of the Company acting
on its behalf, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 6.4 by
the Company.

  

  

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and
in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Takeover
Proposal, any written indication of interest that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Takeover Proposal or any written request for non-public
information) advise Parent orally and in writing of such Takeover Proposal,
such written indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal or such written request for non-public information
relating to the Company, including (A) the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request
and (B) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and such
other facts included in such Takeover Proposal as would be material to an
evaluation of such Takeover Proposal. After receipt of the Takeover Proposal,
written inquiry, written indication of interest or written request, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any
such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request (including
notice of all material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto) and
provide to Parent the material terms and conditions and such other facts
subsequently provided to the Company or its Representatives as would be
material to an evaluation of such Takeover Proposal, written inquiry, written
indication of interest or written request.

  

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to
any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest that could lead
to an Takeover Proposal and shall immediately close and permit no further
access to its electronic data room (but shall permit Parent continued access).
The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
following the execution of this Agreement) demand that each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or its
Representatives with respect to such Person's consideration of a possible
Takeover Proposal (other than agreements that have expired by their terms) to
immediately return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such Person in
accordance with the terms of such Person's confidentiality agreement with the
Company.

  

  

Section 6.5 Company Proxy Statement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's shareholders is
required by Laws in order to consummate the Merger, then promptly following
the later of (i) the Offer Acceptance Time, and (ii) the expiration of any
subsequent offering period, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare a draft of the Company Proxy Statement. Parent shall
provide the Company with any information that may be required in connection
with the preparation and filing of the Company Proxy Statement and any updates
to such information, as appropriate. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such draft, and once such
draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company,
the Company shall file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC.

  

  

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for additional information
from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such comments or
requests and (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable upon request of Parent
and clearance of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC. The Company shall
promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests
and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to the Company Proxy
Statement. Before responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or
mailing of the Company Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the
Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall
include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

  

  

(c) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.6 Company Shareholders Meeting and Short-Form Merger.

  

  

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's shareholders is
required by Laws in order to consummate the Merger, subject to Section 1.2(c),
following the clearance of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company
shall call and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote. Subject to Section 1.2(c), the Company shall (a)
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its
shareholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and (b) take all
other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Requisite Company
Vote; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone,
recess or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of
Parent; (ii) for the absence of a quorum; (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) is necessary or advisable under applicable Laws and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

disseminated to and reviewed by the Company's shareholders prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting; or (iv) if the Company has provided a written
notice to Parent pursuant to Section 1.2(c) or and the latest deadline
contemplated by Section 1.2(c) with respect to such notice has not been
reached.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Purchaser shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (determined on a fully diluted basis), the
parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
merger of Merger Sub and the Company to become effective as soon as reasonably
practicable after such acquisition without a shareholders' meeting in
accordance with Section 10.006 of the Texas Act.

  

  

Section 6.7 Employees; Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) For the period from the Closing Date until December 31, 2012 (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide to each
individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time is an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any individual on short-term
disability leave immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Employee")
the same salary or hourly wage rate (or commission rate, if applicable)
provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective
Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating
the employment of any Employee for any reason. Additionally, nothing herein
shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to pay any bonus or grant any equity or equity-
based awards.

  

  

(b) For the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, offer
Employees benefits at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as those provided
by the existing Company Benefit Plans (excluding any non-union pension plan,
equity based compensation plans and bonus and incentive compensation plans) in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall interfere with Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or
any of their respective Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' rights or obligations to
make such changes as are necessary to comply with applicable Law.

  

  

(c) For the one-year period from the Closing Date until the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, honor the existing
Company severance plans.

  

  

(d) For purposes under employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates providing
benefits to any Employee after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each
Employee shall receive full credit for such Employee's years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company
or its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service) for the determination
of vacation or paid time off and for calculation of severance under the New
Plans. At the

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Effective Time, each Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any medical benefit plan and, with respect to
non-union employees, retirement savings plan (401(k)) that is a New Plan to
the extent such waiting time was satisfied under a similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time. While the Parent and Merger Sub currently intend to
provide benefits to Employees under New Plans which will be based upon
existing plans of Parent or its Affiliates, for similarly situated employees
as in effect at the time such Employees join such New Plan, from and after the
Continuation Period there is no obligation on the part of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to provide any benefit plans.

  

  

(e) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any Employee
is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual agreement or other
arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Vacation Policy"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (i) allow
such Employee to use such accrued vacation if used prior to December 31, 2013,
and (ii) if any Employee's employment terminates on or before December 31,
2013, pay the Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued
and unused vacation time (whether accrued prior to or, subject to the then
current policy, after the Effective Date); provided, however, that an Employee
may not carry over into calendar year 2013 more accrued and unused vacation
days than the number of such days such Employee had accrued up to and
including the Closing Date, but such Employee would continue to accrue
vacation time during calendar year 2013 in accordance with the then applicable
vacation or paid time off policy for use during such calendar year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an Employee has accrued less than
five (5) unused vacation days as of the Closing Date, the maximum number of
vacation days that may be carried over by an Employee into 2013 shall not
exceed five (5) days. As of January 1, 2014, all accrued and unused vacation
time would be subject to the then applicable vacation or paid time off policy
and carry-over time not permitted under such then applicable policy would be
forfeited.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 6.7, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights
or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 6.7. No provision of this Section 6.7 is intended to modify, amend or
create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

  

  

Section 6.8 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor
of any present or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, Continuing Directors and the fiduciaries of any Company
Benefit Plans (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in (i) the Company
Organizational Documents or (ii) otherwise in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

effect as of the date hereof as disclosed in Section 6.8(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter or entered into after the date hereof in accordance with
this Agreement, in each case to survive the Offer and the Merger and to
continue in full force and effect without any modification that would affect
materially and adversely the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Parties for
a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time or, if longer,
for such period as is set forth in any such applicable document.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for at least
six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (including such
coverage held for the benefit of members of the litigation special committee
of the Board of Directors and coverage obtained for members of such committee,
and for Continuing Directors, in each case for the period between the Offer
Acceptance Time and the Effective Time) or policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are not required to pay a premium in excess of 300 % of
the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the date
of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior
sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements
contemplated by this Section 6.8(b), before the Effective Time, the Company
shall be entitled to purchase one or more six (6) year "tail" prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering the matters
described in this Section 6.8(b) and for the benefit of the persons who, as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, are covered by the
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company
(or are obtained for any period between the Offer Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time, as described above), and, if the Company elects to purchase
such policies before the Effective Time, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this Section 6.8(b) shall be satisfied so long
as Parent and the Surviving Corporation cause such policies to be maintained
in effect for a period of six years following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all
necessary action so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.8.

  

  

Section 6.9 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
except as provided in Section 6.10, each of the parties to this Agreement
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions to the
Offer and the conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, provided, however, that no party shall be obligated by this
Section 6.9 to waive any condition to the Offer or condition to the Merger.
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Section 6.9 shall not limit the
rights of the Company set forth in Sections 1.2 and 6.4.

  

  

Section 6.10 Consents; Filings; Further Action.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
Parent shall, subject to Section 6.1(d), cause each of its Affiliates to, use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or
other authorizations, and make any filings and notifications required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
however, (A) in no event shall Parent, Merger sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries be required to make any payment to such third parties
or concede anything of value in any case prior to the Effective Time in order
to obtain any such consent, approval or authorization pursuant to applicable
Laws other than Exon-Florio, and (B), none of the foregoing shall require
Parent or Merger Sub to make any payment or concede anything of value in order
to obtain any consent, approval or authorization from a third party that is
not a Governmental Authority, (ii) make any other filings or submissions
either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, Exon-Florio, any Foreign
Competition Law, the Texas Act, the Applicable Exchange rules and regulations
and any other applicable Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 6.10 to
cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable, under such Laws as soon
as practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all such filings and notifications,
including by providing copies of the non-confidential portions of all relevant
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event no later than ten Business Days after the date hereof, each of Parent
and the Company shall file and not withdraw any Notification and Report Forms
and related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice, as applicable, to
request early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary,
proper or advisable.

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and, after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request. No
party shall participate in any meeting or engage in any material substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall
advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
connection with any consent, approval, authorization, clearance or filing
under applicable antitrust Laws, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates shall be required to (and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall), (i) sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate
any entities, assets, Intellectual Property or businesses of any such party
or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its

terminated by either Parent or the Company at any time before the Effective
Time by written notice to the other:

  

  

(a) if Offer Acceptance Time has not occurred by the close of business on

terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.2(a) shall not be available to
any party if the failure of such party (and in the case of Parent, the Merger
Sub) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Offer
to be consummated on or before the Termination Date;

  

  

(b) if any Antitrust Order permanently enjoins or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and such Antitrust Order has become
final and nonappealable; or

the Merger, and such Order has become final and nonappealable and would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the business

(a) if, whether or not permitted to do so, (i) the Company Board shall have
made an Adverse Change Recommendation (provided that, any written notice,
including pursuant to Section 1.2, of the Company's intention to make an
Adverse Change Recommendation in advance of making an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall not result in Parent having any termination rights pursuant to
this Section 8.3(a) unless such written notice constitutes an Adverse Change
Recommendation), (ii) the Company shall have failed to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (iii) the Company Board fails
to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(10) calendar days after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide

Proposal, or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for all outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company is commenced and the Company Board recommends
in favor of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders; or

  

  

(c) if the Company breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise
to, if occurring or continuing at the Expiration Date, the failure of the
conditions in Annex I and (ii) has not been cured by the Company (provided
such breach is curable by the Company) within the earlier of the Termination
Date and within twenty (20) Business Days after the Company's receipt of
written notice of such breach from Parent, but only so long as neither Parent
nor Merger Sub are then in material breach of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.4 Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated by
the Company at any time before the Offer Acceptance Time by written notice to
the Parent:

  

  

(a) if Company Board has made an Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance
with this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company
after the date of this Agreement, provided, however that the Company shall
comply with its obligations under Section 8.6(b) and substantially
concurrently with such termination enter into the Acquisition Agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal;

  

  

(b) if Parent or Merger Sub (i) breaches any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach, individually or in the aggregate, would delay the
consummation of the Offer beyond the Termination Date or prevent the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (ii) has not been cured by Parent
(provided such breach is curable by Parent) within the earlier of twenty (20)
Business Days after Parent's receipt of written notice of such breach from the
Company and the Termination Date, but only so long as the Company is not then
in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition in Annex I; or

  

  

(c) if (i) all of the conditions set forth on Annex I shall have been
satisfied or waived as of the expiration of the Offer (including any
extensions thereof in accordance with Section 1.1), and Merger Sub shall have
failed to consummate the Offer promptly thereafter in accordance with Section
1.1 and (ii) such failure shall not have not been cured by Parent or Merger
Sub within the earlier of three days after the receipt of written notice of
such breach from the Company and the Termination Date.

  

  

Section 8.5 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
this Article VIII, except as set forth in this Section 8.5, it shall become
void and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of no further force and effect, with no Liability (other than as provided in
Section 8.6) on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any shareholder or
Representative of such party); provided, that subject to Section 8.6, if such
termination results from the (a) failure of any party to perform its
covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement or (b)
intentional breach by any party of its representations or warranties contained
in this Agreement, then such party shall be fully liable for any Damages
incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure or
breach. The provisions of Section 6.3(b), Section 6.13, this Section 8.5,
Section 8.6, Article IX, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

$1,500,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement Amount"), and (y) in the case of
clauses (iv) and (v) below, the Expense Reimbursement Amount:

  

  

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.4(a),
in which case payment shall be made concurrently with such termination;

  

  

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or
Section 8.3(b), in which case payment shall be made within two Business Days
following such termination;

  

  

(iii) if (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made or publicly
proposed to the Company or otherwise publicly announced prior to or at the
termination of this Agreement and not subsequently withdrawn, (B) this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent pursuant to 8.3(c) or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (unless the Company would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b) (determined without giving
effect to the notice and cure provisions contained therein) but for such
termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(c)) and (C) within 365

Takeover Proposal or enters into a Contract providing for the implementation
of any Takeover Proposal and the transaction is subsequently consummated, in
which case payment shall be made within five Business Days following the date
on which the Company consummates

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

such Takeover Proposal. For purposes of the foregoing clause (C) only,
references in the definition of the term "Takeover Proposal" to the figure
"20%" shall be deemed to be replaced by "more than 50%"; provided; however
that any amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.6(b)(iii) shall be reduced
by the amount of any previous payment pursuant to Section 8.6(b)(iv) or
Section 8.6(b)(v);

  

  

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c); or

  

  

(v) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a),
and Parent has not breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would permit the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b) (determined
without giving effect to the notice and cure provisions contained therein) or
Section 8.4(c).

  

  

(c) Parent and the Company acknowledge that (i) the fees and other provisions
of this Section 8.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, Parent and the Company would
not enter into this Agreement and (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this

terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.4(a) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(a), Section 8.3(b) or 8.3(c) and in connection
with such termination the Company is required to pay the Company Termination
Fee, Parent's receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise)
of such party and its Affiliates, as applicable, for (x) any Damages suffered
as a result of the failure of the Offer or Merger to be consummated and (y)
any other Damages suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the

shall have any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section
8.6, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee
and/or the Expense Reimbursement Amount, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee
and/or the Expense Reimbursement Amount (as applicable) from the date such
payment was required until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made; provided,
further, that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of Parent or the
Company, if any, to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to Section 9.15 prior to
any termination of this Agreement.

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of
such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to

disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such

Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.14 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of

Section 9.15 Specific Performance. Subject to Section 8.6, the parties to this

or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this
Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar
collateral in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge and agree that
each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Without
limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to
the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance (i) to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure
breaches of, Section 6.10 by Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) if (A) all
conditions in Annex I or Section 7.1 (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time or Closing, as
the case may be) have been satisfied and (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Offer or the Closing by the date the Offer or Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.1 or Section 2.2, respectively, to
cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement

provisions of this Agreement, including to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to
effect the Offer and/or the Closing in accordance with Section 1.1 or Section
2.2, as the case may be, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(a) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
