by the parties for all Tax purposes in accordance with the foregoing, unless
otherwise required by a Governmental Authority as a result of a 
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The parties
shall cooperate with each other and their respective counsel to document and
support the Tax treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the

letters.

Merger Consideration, pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, shall be entitled to
receive such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, upon receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), together with a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents

Thereafter, any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that remains

portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this

Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

relating to shares of Domesticated Acquiror Common Stock upon substantially
the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to vesting and
termination-related provisions (each, an " _Acquiror Option_ ") except that
(a) such Acquiror Option shall relate to that whole number of shares of
Domesticated Acquiror Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option,
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, and (b) the exercise price per share for
each such Acquiror Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
such Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, 
_divided by_ the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so
determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the conversion of the Company Options will be made in a
manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that such
conversion will not constitute a "modification" of such Company Options for
purposes of Section 409A or Section 424 of the Code.

terms and conditions as were applicable to such Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to vesting
and termination-related provisions), except that such Adjusted Restricted
Stock Award shall relate to such number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror
Common Stock as is equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Common
Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time,  _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

Domesticated Acquiror Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock
Unit Award_ ") with substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including with respect to vesting and termination-related
provisions), except that such Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award shall
relate to such number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Common Stock as is
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(d) The Company shall take all necessary actions to effect the
treatment of Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted
Stock Unit Awards pursuant to _Sections 3.3(a)_, _3.3(b)_ and _3.3(c)_ in
accordance with the Company Incentive Plan and the applicable award
agreements and to ensure that no Acquiror Option may be exercised prior to the
effective date of an applicable Form S-8 (or other applicable form, including
Form S-1 or Form S-3) of Acquiror. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall amend the Company Incentive Plan and take all other necessary actions,

remaining unallocated share reserve under the Company Incentive Plan
and provide that shares in respect of Company Awards that for any reason

determined by Acquiror, the Company, or the Exchange Agent, respectively);
_provided_ , that Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Company with at least ten (10) days prior written notice of any
amounts that it intends to withhold in connection with the payment of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration and will reasonably cooperate with the
Company to reduce or eliminate any applicable withholding. To the extent that
any amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts
shall be (i) timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and
(ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.5. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal
rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares
of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's appraisal rights under
the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, but instead shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, waives, withdraws, or loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.1_ without interest thereon, upon transfer of such shares. The
Company shall provide Acquiror prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any waiver or
withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice, or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates to such
demand. Except with the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, delayed or denied), the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any
such demands.

For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Company Benefit Plan_ " means an
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement

equity-based compensation, severance, retention, supplemental retirement,
change in control or similar plan, policy, program or agreement) providing
compensation or other benefits to any current or former director, officer,

respect to any Company Benefit Plan and any pending request for such a
determination letter.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 4.13(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, (i) each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including
ERISA and the Code, except where the failure to comply would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (ii) in all material respects, all contributions required to be made
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan on or before the date hereof have
been made and all obligations in respect of each Company Benefit Plan as of
the date hereof have been accrued and reflected in the Company's financial
statements to the extent required by GAAP; (iii) each Company Benefit Plan
which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS as
to its qualification or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
such Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

   

36

 



    



  

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other
pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (" _Title IV Plan_ "), and
neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has sponsored or
contributed to, been required to contribute to, or had any actual or
contingent liability under, a Multiemployer Plan or Title IV Plan at any time
within the previous six (6) years. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability under Section 4201 of ERISA
that has not been fully satisfied.

  



  

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, no material actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the

and to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or
claims.

extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than

"pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
current or former employee (or his or her beneficiary).

  



  

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 4.13(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, either alone or in combination with another event (such as
termination following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby), (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer or other service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to any severance pay
or any other compensation or benefits payable or to be provided by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, except for the Management Grants,
as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment,
funding or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due any
such employee, officer or other individual service provider by the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) accelerate the vesting and/or

contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, result in any "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of
the Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for a Tax gross-up, make whole or
similar payment with respect to the Taxes imposed under Sections 409A or 4999
of the Code.

applicable. Each Company Option is intended to either qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code or to be exempt
under Section 409A of the Code. The Company has made available to Acquiror,
accurate and complete copies of (i) the Company Incentive Plan, (ii) the
forms of standard award agreement under the Company Incentive Plan, (iii)
copies of any award agreements that materially deviate from such forms and
(iv) a list of all outstanding equity and equity-based awards granted under
any Company Incentive Plan, together with the material terms thereof
(including but not limited to grant date, exercise price, vesting terms, form
of award, expiration date, and number of shares underlying such award). The

of the Company Incentive Plan or any Contract governing the terms of such
awards.

Section 5.6. _Internal Controls; Listing; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Except as not required in reliance on exemptions from various
reporting requirements by virtue of Acquiror's status as an "emerging growth
company" within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (" _JOBS Act_ "), Acquiror has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that material information relating to Acquiror,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, if any, is made known to Acquiror's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Acquiror's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since April 30, 2020, Acquiror has established and maintained a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule

regarding the reliability of Acquiror's financial reporting and the
preparation of Acquiror Financial Statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

the SEC on a timely basis all statements required by Section 16(a) of the

(c) Since April 30, 2020, Acquiror has complied in all material
respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). The Acquiror
Class A Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act and is listed for trading on the NYSE. There is no Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror by the
NYSE or the SEC with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister
the Acquiror Class A Common Stock or prohibit or terminate the listing of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the NYSE.

(d) The Acquiror SEC Filings contain true and complete copies of

October 18, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, together with the
auditor's reports thereon (the " _Acquiror Financial Statements_ "). Except
as disclosed in the Acquiror SEC Filings, the Acquiror Financial Statements
(i) fairly present in all material respects the financial position of
Acquiror, as at the respective dates thereof, and the results of operations
and consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended, (ii) were
prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto), and (iii) comply in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and with the rules and regulations of the SEC, the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act in effect as of the respective dates
thereof. The books and records of Acquiror have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements.

  



  

(e) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit
made by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(f) Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor
Acquiror's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves Acquiror's management or other employees who have a
role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by Acquiror or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any
of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 5.7. _Governmental Authorities; Consents_. Assuming the truth

has at least $414,000,000.00 in the Trust Account (including, if applicable,
an aggregate of approximately $14,490,000.00 of deferred underwriting
commissions and other fees being held in the Trust Account), such monies
invested in United States government securities or money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of April
27, 2020, between Acquiror and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as
trustee (the " _Trustee_ ") (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). There are no
separate Contracts, side letters or other arrangements or
understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would
cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Acquiror SEC Filings to
be inaccurate or that would entitle any Person (other than shareholders of
Acquiror holding Acquiror Common Shares sold in Acquiror's initial public
offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Acquiror Common
Stock pursuant to Acquiror's Governing Documents and the underwriters of
Acquiror's initial public offering with respect to deferred underwriting
commissions) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released other
than to pay Taxes and payments with respect to all Acquiror Share Redemptions.
There are no claims or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror,
threatened with respect to the Trust Account. Acquiror has performed all
material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is not
in default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed
or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred
which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
default or breach thereunder. As of the Effective Time, the obligations of
Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to Acquiror's Governing Documents
shall terminate, and as of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall have no
obligation whatsoever pursuant to Acquiror's Governing Documents to dissolve
and liquidate the assets of Acquiror by reason of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. To Acquiror's knowledge, as of the date
hereof, following the Effective Time, no Acquiror Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such Acquiror Shareholder is exercising an Acquiror Share Redemption. As of
the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained herein and the compliance by the Company with its
obligations hereunder, neither Acquiror or Merger Sub have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account
will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be
available to Acquiror and Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

reserved for on the financial statements or disclosed in the notes thereto
included in Acquiror SEC Filings, (ii) that have arisen since the date of

Section 7.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the (x) Company and each of its Subsidiaries (in each case, solely to the
extent acting in their capacity as such and to the extent such activities are
related to the business of the Company being acquired under this Agreement)
(the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") and (y) Acquiror and each of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ " together with the
Company Indemnified Parties, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company, Acquiror or their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under
applicable Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, certificate
of formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or other
organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such DandO Indemnified Parties (including the advancing of expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i) maintain
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions
in its Governing Documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of Acquiror's and its
Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors, employees, and agents
that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
Governing Documents of the Company, Acquiror or their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume,
and be liable for, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.8_.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently covered by Acquiror's, the Company's
or their respective Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives) on
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage,
except that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual premium payable by Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, for such
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019; provided, however, that
(i) Acquiror may cause coverage to be extended under the current directors'
and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy
containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such
six (6) year period, any insurance required to be maintained under this
_Section 7.8_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final
disposition thereof.

of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

writing by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,

would not increase conditionality or impose any new obligation on the Company
or Acquiror, reduce the Minimum PIPE Investment Amount or the subscription
amount under any Subscription Agreement or reduce or impair the rights of
Acquiror under any Subscription Agreement, Acquiror shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, any waiver (in whole or in part) of,
or provide consent to modify (including consent to terminate), any
provision or remedy under, or any replacements of, any of the Subscription
Agreements, in each case, other than any assignment or transfer contemplated
therein or expressly permitted thereby (without any further amendment,
modification or waiver to such assignment or transfer provision); _provided_
, that, in the case of any such assignment or transfer, the initial party to
such Subscription Agreement remains bound by its obligations with respect
thereto in the event that the transferee or assignee, as applicable, does not
comply with its obligations to consummate the purchase of shares of
Domesticated Acquiror Common Stock contemplated thereby. Subject to the
immediately preceding sentence and in the event that all conditions in the
Subscription Agreements have been satisfied, Acquiror shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions
required, necessary or that it otherwise deems to be proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the
terms described therein, including using its reasonable best efforts to
enforce its rights under the Subscription Agreements to cause the

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 12.1. _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company acknowledges that
Acquiror is a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a
Business Combination. The Company further acknowledges that, as described in
the prospectus dated April 27, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at
www.sec.gov, substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds
of Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a
the trust account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public
stockholders and the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering (the
" _Trust Account_ "). The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by
Acquiror that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in
the Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise Tax,
income Tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in
the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) if Acquiror completes the
transactions which constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons
and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if Acquiror fails to
complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period and
liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Acquiror in
limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the costs and expenses of its
liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's public stockholders; and
(iii) if Acquiror holds a shareholder vote to amend Acquiror's amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or
timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Acquiror Common Shares if Acquiror
fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period,
then for the redemption of any Acquiror Common Shares properly tendered in
connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into
this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Company hereby irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of
any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust
Account and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds
distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and
any negotiations, Contracts or agreements with Acquiror; _provided_ , that (x)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's right to pursue
a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or other assets held
outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief
in connection with the consummation of the transactions (including a claim
for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and
cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust
Account (after giving effect to the Acquiror Share Redemptions) to the
Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust
Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect Acquiror's ability to
fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share Redemptions, or for
fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that
the Company may have in the future against Acquiror's assets or funds that
are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released
from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired
with any such funds).

representations and warranties (of another party hereto) that are contained
