THE MERGERS

  

  

Section 1.1 The Mergers.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and as part of a single
integrated transaction and plan of reorganization, the Surviving Corporation
shall be merged with and into Merger Sub 2, and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease, and Merger Sub 2
shall be the surviving entity of the Second Merger (the "Surviving LLC").

  

  

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the second Business Day following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), at the
offices of Cohen and Grigsby, P.C., 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15222, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall
file a certificate of merger in respect of the Merger (the "First Certificate
of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Secretary of State"), executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date, shall make any and all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the First Certificate
of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later
date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing and shall
specify in the First Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time"). Parent shall cause the Second Merger to
be consummated immediately following the Effective Time by filing with the
Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger in respect of the Second
Merger (the "Second Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company
Act. The Second Merger shall become effective immediately following the

EFFECTS OF THE MERGERS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK BASED EQUITY AWARDS

  

  

Section 2.1 Merger.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

  

  

(i) Subject to Section 2.1(d), each issued and outstanding share of Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.008 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") (other
than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive (i) 0.20582 (the "Stock Merger
Consideration") of a share of Class A Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), and (ii) $11.80 in cash, without
interest (the "Cash Merger Consideration"). The Stock Merger Consideration,
together with the Cash Merger Consideration is referred to herein as the
"Merger Consideration". As of the Effective Time, each such Share shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and shall
thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
issued and paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

  

  

(ii) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2 or any wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) At the effective time of the Second Merger, by virtue of the Second Merger
and without any action on the part of the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub
2:

  

  

(i) each issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

  

  

(ii) the membership interests of Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the
effective time of the Second Merger shall continue unchanged as a result of
the Second Merger as the membership interests of the Surviving LLC from and
after the effective time of the Second Merger.

  

  

(c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company or Parent, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this
Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any
action with respect to its securities that is otherwise expressly prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
prior to the Effective Time, it is determined that the conditions described in
Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(d) cannot be satisfied because the Total Stock
Consideration would be less than 40.5% of the aggregate Base Merger
Consideration (determined without regard to this Section 2.1(d)), then the
Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased (with a corresponding reduction
in the Cash Merger Consideration) to the extent necessary so that the Total
Stock Consideration is equal to 40.5% of the aggregate Base Merger
Consideration (the "Adjustment"). The Adjustment made pursuant to this Section
2.1(d) shall be made as follows: for each .00001 of a share of Parent Common
Stock increase to the Stock Merger Consideration, there will be a
corresponding decrease to the Cash Merger Consideration in the amount of the
product of .00001 multiplied by the Parent Signing Price.

  

  

Section 2.2 Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

  

  

(a) Each option (each, a "Company Stock Option") to purchase Shares granted
under the Schawk, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Schawk, Inc. 2003
Equity Option Plan (the "Company Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding upon the execution of this Agreement is hereby cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, the Company is paying promptly to each former
holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (i) the excess of $20.00 over the exercise price per Share
under such Company Stock Option

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option; provided,
that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal
to or greater than $20.00, no cash payment shall be made in respect of the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option.

  

  

(b) Each stock appreciation right with respect to Shares (each, an "SAR")
granted under a Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding upon the execution of this Agreement is hereby cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, the Company is paying promptly to each former holder of any
such cancelled SAR an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the
excess of $20.00 over the grant price per Share under such SAR and (ii) the
number of SARs subject to such cancelled SAR; provided, that if the grant
price of such SAR is equal to or greater than $20.00, no cash payment shall be
made in respect of the cancellation of such SAR.

  

  

(c) Each restricted stock unit with respect to Shares (each, an "RSU") granted
under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding upon the execution of this
Agreement is hereby cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Company is paying
promptly to each former holder of any such cancelled RSU an amount in cash
(without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax)
equal to the product of (i) $20.00 and (ii) the portion of the Shares that
would have been payable under such cancelled RSU if such RSU had vested and
become payable in accordance with its terms on the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that any RSU with respect to which a cash payment is not
permitted to be made promptly following its cancellation under the terms of
the instrument granting such RSU shall instead entitle its holder to receive
the cash payment in an amount described in this Section 2.2(c) above upon the
earlier to occur of: (x) the date such cash payment is permitted under the
relevant instrument; or (y) immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) Each restricted Share outstanding under a Company Stock Plan (each, a
"Restricted Share") that is unvested and outstanding upon the execution of
this Agreement shall vest in accordance with its terms on the date of this
Agreement and shall be deemed to be an outstanding Share for the purposes of
this Agreement and the Merger. Any portion of a Restricted Share that does not
vest on the date of this Agreement is hereby cancelled and forfeited, and no
consideration shall be payable in respect of such cancelled and forfeited
portion.

  

  

(e) The Company shall deliver all required notices to each holder of Company
Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs and SARs setting forth each holder's
rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plan, stating that such
Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs and SARs shall be treated in
the manner set forth in this Section 2.2.

  

  

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and (ii) no holder
of a Company Stock Option, a Restricted Share, an RSU or a SAR or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan or any other employee incentive or
benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan
maintained by the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in
respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving LLC or any of their Subsidiaries, except as set forth in this
Section 2.2.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) With respect to the Schawk, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), the Company shall amend the ESPP effective on or
before the date of this Agreement so that after March 31, 2014 (i) no further
"Options" (as defined in the ESPP) shall be granted under the ESPP, and (ii)
any accumulated payroll deductions previously withheld on behalf of the
participants in the ESPP shall be refunded to such employees such that the
balance of the Purchase Account (as defined in the ESPP) shall be $0. In
addition, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in
accordance with the ESPP plan document and all applicable Laws, take all
action necessary to terminate the ESPP and to distribute all Deposited Shares
(as defined in the ESPP) to Participants.

  

  

Section 2.3 Exchange and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an
agreement with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging the Shares for
the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
Shares, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
constituting the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to the Exchange Agent cash in immediately available funds
and/or other property sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.3(d), as and when such dividends or distributions are
paid or made. Parent further agrees, following the Effective Time, to promptly
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, any
additional cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock to pay the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. Any cash and the
certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund". The Merger
Consideration so deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to the holders of Shares, be invested by the Exchange Agent in
(i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America or (ii)
short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest. Any interest and other income from any such investments shall become
part of the funds held by the Exchange Agent for purposes of paying the Merger
Consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, no investment by the Exchange
Agent of the Merger Consideration shall (x) have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement or (y) relieve Parent
or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this Article II.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund the
payment required by this Article II. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of
the Exchange Agent.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("Certificates") and to
each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry ("Book-Entry
Shares") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect thereto, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary
form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Certificates or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal (or, in the case
of a Book-Entry Share, upon delivery of such letter of transmittal), duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require (a
"Proper Delivery"), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent
Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 (after aggregating
any fractional shares resulting from all Shares surrendered by such holder
pursuant to the Merger), (B) the Cash Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and/or (C) a check in the
amount of cash that such holder is entitled to be paid in respect of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3(d), if any, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares. Payment of Merger Consideration shall be made as
promptly as practicable after the date of Proper Delivery of the applicable
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

  

  

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book- Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and no cash payment in respect of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(e), unless and
until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such
Certificate or return the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a Book-
Entry Share, in accordance with Section 2.3(b). Subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or return of the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a
Book- Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Share, without interest, (i) an amount equal to the amount (and
type) of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid or made with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock for which the Shares represented by the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares were exchanged, and (ii) without duplication, at the
appropriate payment date, an amount equal to the amount (and type) of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to the date of surrender of such holder's Certificate or return of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

   
 

the form of letter of transmittal in the case of a Book-Entity Share, and a
payment date occurring after the date of surrender, payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock for which the Shares represented by
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares were exchanged.

  

  

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each former holder of Shares who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be
required thereon, equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by the arithmetic average of the average daily high and low
sales prices per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ during the
ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.

  

  

(f) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

  

  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as
general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent
or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.4 Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock
Options, RSUs, SARs or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

  

Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have
failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's
right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect
or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such
holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the
right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such
right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a). The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company
and each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company's
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except in each case as would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means any event, change, circumstance,
occurrence, effect or state of facts that is materially adverse to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that no
event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts to the
extent arising out of or attributable to any of the following, either alone or
in combination, shall constitute, or be taken into account in determining
whether there is or has been, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) any
condition, change, event, occurrence or effect in the industry in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries operates, or the United States or global
economy, (2) changes, events, effects or occurrences in financial, credit,
banking or securities markets, including effects on such markets resulting
from any regulatory and political conditions or developments in general as
well as any decline in the price of any market index, or in respect of any
interest rate or exchange rate changes or general financial or capital market
conditions, (3) compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the taking of any
action required by this Agreement or taken pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement with the consent or at the request or direction of Parent, or
the failure to take any action that is prohibited by this Agreement or that is
not taken as a result of a failure of Parent to consent to any action
requiring Parent's consent under this Agreement or any action taken by Parent,
Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2, (4) any acts of God, natural disasters, terrorism,
armed hostilities, sabotage, war or any escalation or worsening of acts of
terrorism, armed hostilities or war; (5) the negotiation, execution,
announcement or performance of this Agreement or the announcement, pendency of
or performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
by reason of the identity of Parent or any communication by Parent regarding
the plans or intentions of Parent with respect to the conduct of the business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and including the impact of any of
the foregoing on any relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, distributors, collaboration partners, stockholders, lenders,
employees or regulators (including without limitation, any cancellations of or
delays in customer or client agreements, any reduction in sales, any
disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or similar relationships or any
loss of employees caused thereby), (6) any failure, in and of itself, by the
Company or its Subsidiaries to meet internal, analysts' or other earnings
estimates or financial projections, or forecasts for any period, or the
issuance of revised projections that are not as optimistic as those in
existence as of the date hereof, or any change in credit ratings or other
ratings with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (7) any
pending, initiated or threatened legal or administrative proceeding, claim,
suit or action against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers or directors, in each case, arising out of or relating to
the execution of this Agreement or the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

   
 

announcement, pendency or performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that, with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4), the
impact of such event, change, circumstances, occurrence, effect or state of
facts is not disproportionately adverse (relative to other industry

such Company Stock Option, and no Company Stock Option is subject to Section

Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation"). The Company is providing to

for the consummation of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Company's capital stock or other securities is required for the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated
by the Company other than the Merger.

in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and

including any obligation for corrective or remedial action.

  

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written

the period for the assessment or collection of any Tax that is still in

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

   
 

effect. Section 3.15(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all

predecessor provision thereof, or any similar provision of state, local, or
foreign Law that could materially affect the liability of the Company or any
Subsidiary for Taxes following the Merger.

  

  

(g) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its Tax Returns
all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the

(h) No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has not filed

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is required
to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law by reason of a change in accounting

that a Governmental Entity has proposed any such adjustment or change in
accounting method, nor is any application pending with any Governmental Entity
requesting permission for any change in accounting method.

  

  

(j) Other than in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law), neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any material item of
income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, U.S. taxable income
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any transaction that occurred prior to the Merger, including (i) any
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the

within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, nor has it been a "United
States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(i) of the Code.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(m) There are no material deferred intercompany transactions within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13(b)(1) with respect to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be required to include any
material item of income or gain in, or exclude any item of deduction or loss
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
after the Closing Date. There are no material "excess loss accounts" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19(a)(2) with respect to any
Subsidiaries of the Company. There are no material items of income that will
be required to be recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
result of the Merger.

  

  

(n) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a party to a
Contract (other than a Contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business with vendors, customers and lessors) that provides for material Tax
indemnity or Tax sharing, or for the payment of any portion of a Tax (or pay
any amount calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax) of any other
Person, or (ii) has any Liability for Taxes of any Person (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or
successor. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member
of a combined, consolidated, unitary or similar group for Tax purposes, other
than any such group of which the Company was at all times the common parent
corporation.

  

  

(o) The amount and nature of the tax attributes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryovers) reported in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC are true and correct in all material respects as of the end
of the Company's most recent taxable year described therein, and no
transaction has occurred since the end of the period covered in such annual
report that has materially reduced any such tax attributes other than in the
ordinary course of business. The Company is not aware of any other material
limitations on its ability to utilize such attributes other than by reason of
the effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Sections
382 and 383 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign
Tax Law, if any. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has undergone
an ownership change (as defined in Section 382(g) of the Code) under Section
382 and/or Section 383 of the Code.

  

  

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code
(x) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) in a
distribution which would otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of
related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code and
regulations thereunder) in conjunction with the Merger.

  

  

(q) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated (i) in a
transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types
of transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction
and identified by notice, regulation, or other form of published guidance as a
listed transaction, as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(1)
or, (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, in a reportable transaction (other
than a listed transaction), as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(r) Section 3.15(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each Tax
ruling, Tax holiday and other agreement with any Government Entity with
respect to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with each such Tax ruling, Tax holiday and
other agreement in all material respects. There is no material risk that any
material Tax ruling, Tax holiday or other agreement with any Government Entity
with respect to Taxes will expire, be revoked or otherwise terminate, whether
as a result of the Merger or otherwise prior to the stated or applicable term
thereof as provided therein. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently has outstanding any requests for Tax rulings, Tax holidays or other
agreements with any Government Entity with respect to Taxes that would
materially adversely affect their liability for Taxes or the amount of taxable
income or loss for any tax year or period ending after the Closing Date.

  

  

(s) The Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable transfer pricing laws and regulations,
including the execution and maintenance of contemporaneous documentation
substantiating transfer pricing practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
The prices for any property or services (or for the use of any property)
provided by or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are, in all material
respects, arm's-length prices for purposes of the relevant transfer pricing
Laws, including Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 482 of the
Code.

  

  

(t) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or
knows of any fact that could be reasonably expected to prevent the Integrated
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

  

  

(u) No Subsidiary of the Company that is a "controlled foreign corporation" as
defined in the Code owns (directly or indirectly) a material "investment in
United States property" for purposes of Section 956 of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns an interest in any entity treated as
a "passive foreign investment company" as defined in the Code.

  

  

Section 3.16 Contracts.

  

  

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all of the Material
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound other than those
Material Contracts already set forth in the Company SEC Documents publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement. All copies of Material
Contracts made available to Parent are true and complete copies of such
Contracts. "Material Contracts" means:

  

  

(i) any Contract that would be required to be filed by the Company as a
"material contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act or disclosed by the Company on a Current Report on Form 8-K;

  

  

(ii) any Contract that limits the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, would limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation) to compete in any line of
business or with any Person or in any

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

   
 

geographic area, or that restricts the right of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, would limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation) to sell to or purchase from
any Person or to hire any Person, or that grants the other party or any third
Person "most favored nation" status or any similar type of favored discount
rights;

  

  

(iii) any Contract with respect to the formation, creation, operation,
management or control of a joint venture, partnership, limited liability or
other similar agreement or arrangement; or

  

  

(iv) any Contract with a customer that is material to the business of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary that requires a consent to or otherwise
contains a provision relating to a "change of control," or that would or would
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent such Subsidiary is a party thereto, as applicable,
and to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, and is in full
force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except that (i)
such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought and except as would not individually or
in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no default, under any Material Contract by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to its knowledge, any other party thereto, except
for such defaults that individually or in the aggregate would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all Material Contracts,
including any amendments thereto. The Company makes no representation or
warranty concerning the effect of the transactions contemplated hereby on any
"change in control" or similar clause contained in any Material Contract.

  

  

Section 3.17 Insurance. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of the date hereof, a true and complete list of all material
insurance policies issued in favor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a named insured
or otherwise a beneficiary, as well as any historic occurrence-based policies
still in force. With respect to each such insurance policy, (a) such policy
is, to the knowledge of the Company, in full force and effect and all premiums
due thereon have been paid, and (b) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach or default, and has not taken any action or failed
to take any action which (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would constitute such a breach or default, or would permit cancellation or
termination of, any such policy. No notice of cancellation or termination has
been received with respect to any such policy.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 3.18 Properties.

  

  

(a) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or in
the case of leased property and leased tangible assets, a valid leasehold
interest in, all of its assets constituting personal property (excluding, for
purposes of this sentence, assets held under leases), free and clear of all
Liens other than (i) statutory ad valorem and real estate and other Liens for
taxes and assessments not yet past due or the amount or validity of which is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) mechanics',
workmen's, repairmen's, landlord's, warehousemen's, carriers' or similar Liens
arising in the ordinary course of business of the Company or such Subsidiary
consistent with past practice, (iii) encumbrances on real property in the
nature of zoning restrictions, easements, rights of way, encroachments,
restrictive covenants, (iv) pledges or deposits by the Company and its
Subsidiaries under workmen's compensation laws, unemployment insurance laws or
similar legislation, or good faith deposits in connection with bids, tenders,
contracts (other than for the payment of Indebtedness) or leases to which such
Person is a party, or deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of
such Person or deposits of cash or U.S. government bonds to secure surety
appeal bonds to which such Person is a party, and other obligations or
deposits as security for contested taxes or import duties or for the payment
of rent, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business, (v) other
similar rights or restrictions that were not incurred in connection with the
borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit and that do not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby or materially impair present
business operations at such properties, (vi) existing Liens disclosed in the
Company's consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2012 (or the notes
thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents; and (vii) any such matters of
record, Liens and other imperfections of title that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially impair the continued ownership, use and operation of
the assets to which they relate in the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted ("Permitted Liens").

  

  

(b) Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all real property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ("Owned Real Property") and all property leased for the benefit
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Leased Real Property"). Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) good and marketable title in fee
simple to all Owned Real Property and (ii) good leasehold title to all Leased
Real Property, in each case, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Liens. No parcel of Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property is subject to
any governmental decree or order to be sold or is being condemned,
expropriated or otherwise taken by any public authority with or without
payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has
any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed. All leases of
Leased Real Property and all amendments and modifications thereto are in full
force and effect, and there exists no default under any such lease by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto, nor any event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto,
except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Assuming all
consents, approvals and authorizations listed in Section 3.5 of the Company
Disclosure Letter relating to any Leased Real Property have been obtained, all
leases of Leased Real Property shall remain valid and binding in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) There are no contractual or legal restrictions that preclude or materially
restrict the ability to use any Owned Real Property or, to the knowledge of
the Company, Leased Real Property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for the current or contemplated use of such real property. To the knowledge of
the Company, there are no latent defects or adverse physical conditions
affecting the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, that would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All plants,
warehouses, distribution centers, structures and other buildings on the Owned
Real Property or Leased Real Property are adequately maintained in all
material respects and are in operating condition and repair sufficient for the
requirements of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.

  

  

(d) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied with the terms of
all leases to which it is a party, and all such leases are in full force and
effect, except for any such noncompliance or failure to be in full force and
effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under
all such leases, except for any such failure to do so that, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.19 Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) As used herein, the term "Intellectual Property" means all intellectual
property rights arising under the laws of the United States or any other
jurisdiction, including the following: (i) trade names, trademarks and service
marks (registered and unregistered), domain names, trade dress and similar
rights and applications to register any of the foregoing (collectively,
"Marks"); (ii) patents and patent applications and rights in respect of
utility models or industrial designs (collectively, "Patents"); (iii)
published and unpublished works of authorship, copyrights and registrations
and applications therefor (collectively, "Copyrights"); and (iv) know-how,
inventions, discoveries, methods, processes, technical data, specifications,
research and development information, technology, data bases and other
proprietary or confidential information, including customer lists, in each
case that derives economic value (actual or potential) from not being
generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its
disclosure, but excluding any Copyrights or Patents that cover or protect any
of the foregoing (collectively, "Trade Secrets").

  

  

(b) Section 3.19(b)(1) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of all registered Marks and applications for registration of
Marks owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Registered Marks"), Section 3.19(b)(2) of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of all
Patents owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Patents") and Section 3.19(b)(3) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of all
registered Copyrights and all pending applications for registration of
Copyrights owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Registered Copyrights" and, together with
the Company Registered Marks and the Company Patents, "Company Registered
IP"). No Company Registered IP owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to knowledge of the Company, exclusively licensed to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has been or is now involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition, nullity or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

   
 

cancellation proceeding and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such action
is or has been threatened with respect to any of the Company Registered IP.
The Company Registered IP owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to knowledge of the Company, exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subsisting. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company
Registered IP (excluding any pending applications included in the Company
Registered IP) is valid and enforceable and, except as set forth on Section
3.19(b)(4) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no written or, to the knowledge
of the Company, oral notice or claim challenging the validity or
enforceability or alleging the misuse of any of the Company Registered IP has
been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment,
invalidation or unenforceability of any of the Company Registered IP, and all
filing, examination, issuance, post registration and maintenance fees,
annuities and the like that have come due and are required to maintain,
preserve or renew any of the Company Registered IP owned by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to knowledge of the Company, exclusively licensed to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely paid. Except as set
forth on Section 3.19(b)(5) of the Company Disclosure Letter, with respect to
the Company Registered IP owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
to the knowledge of the Company with respect to the Company Registered IP
exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there are no
filings, payments or other actions that were required to have been or are
required to be made or taken within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to office actions, documents, applications or
certificates, for the purposes of complying with legal requirements to obtain,
maintain, preserve or renew any Company Registered IP.

  

  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect their rights in the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries and maintain the confidentiality of all of the Trade Secrets
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All current or former employees,
consultants and contractors who have participated in the creation of any
Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or its Subsidiaries have
entered into proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment
agreements substantially in the Company's standard forms (which have
previously been provided to Parent).

  

  

(d) The Company or its Subsidiaries own, or possess adequate licenses or other
valid rights to use, all of the Intellectual Property that is necessary for
the conduct of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses. None of the
Intellectual Property owned by or, to the knowledge of the Company, licensed
to, the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order,
judgment, or stipulation restricting the use or exploitation thereof by the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result
in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right of any third party to
terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' rights or obligations under any Material Contract as defined in
Section 3.16(a)(viii) of this Agreement. The rights licensed under each
agreement granting to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, any material

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

   
 

right or license under or with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by a
third party shall be exercisable by the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary, respectively, on and immediately after the Closing to the same
extent as by the Company or such Subsidiary prior to the Closing. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any third party any
exclusive rights under any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. All milestones and other conditions set forth in any license
agreements under which Intellectual Property is licensed to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are required to be satisfied in order for the Company
or such Subsidiary to retain any exclusive rights granted under such
agreements have been timely satisfied and all such exclusive rights remain in
full force and effect.

  

  

(f) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns exclusively all right,
title and interest to the Company Registered IP (other than Company Registered
IP exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and all
other Intellectual Property purportedly owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written or,
to the knowledge of the Company, oral notice or claim challenging the
Company's or such Subsidiary's ownership of any of such Intellectual Property.
To the knowledge of the Company, no loss, impairment or expiration of any
Intellectual Property rights used in the Company's and the Subsidiaries'
business as currently conducted is pending or threatened.

  

  

(g) The conduct of the Company's and the Subsidiaries' business as currently
conducted, including the use or other exploitation of the Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has not infringed,
misappropriated, diluted or violated, and does not infringe, misappropriate,
dilute or violate, in any material respect, any Intellectual Property of any
third party or constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under
the laws of any jurisdiction, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the knowledge of the Company,
oral notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any such infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution, unfair competition or unfair trade
practice has occurred, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any
reasonable basis therefor. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) no third party
is, in any material respect, misappropriating or infringing any material
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (ii) no third party has made any unauthorized disclosure of
any Trade Secrets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, at no time during the conception of or
reduction to practice of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries was any developer, inventor or other contributor to such
Intellectual Property operating under any grants from any Governmental Entity
or private source, performing research sponsored by any Governmental Entity or
private source or subject to any employment agreement or invention assignment
or nondisclosure agreement or other obligation with any third party, in each
case that would impair or limit the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
rights in such Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, there
exist no inventions by current or former employees or consultants of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries made or otherwise conceived prior to their
beginning employment or consultation with the Company or such Subsidiary that
have been or are intended to be incorporated into any of the Company's
Intellectual Property or products, other than any such inventions that have
been validly and irrevocably assigned or licensed to the Company by written
agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(i) To the knowledge of the Company, there has been no prior use of any
Company Registered Mark or any material unregistered Mark adopted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Marks") by any
third party that would confer upon such third party superior rights in such
Company Mark.

  

  

Section 3.20 Products. Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company any distributor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received a claim for or based upon
breach of product or service warranty or guaranty or similar claim, strict
liability in tort, negligent design of product, negligent provision of
services or any other allegation of liability, including or arising from the
materials, design, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling (including
instructions for use), or sale of its products or from the provision of
services, in each case that would not result in material liability to the
Company and its Subsidiaries in excess of the warranty reserve reflected on
the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2013.

  

  

Section 3.21 Reserved.

  

  

Section 3.22 Reserved.

  

  

Section 3.23 State Takeover Statutes. Assuming that the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 4.14 is true and correct, the Company Board has
taken all actions necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Support Agreements, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203
of the DGCL and all takeover-related provisions set forth in the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, without any further action on the
part of the Stockholders or the Company Board. No other "moratorium," "fair
price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or similar
provision of any state statutory anti-takeover Law (collectively, "Takeover
Laws") applies to this Agreement, the Support Agreements or the Mergers.

  

  

Section 3.24 No Rights Plan. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison
pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which the
Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

  

  

Section 3.25 Related Party Transactions. No present director, executive
officer, stockholder owning 5% or more of the Company's Shares, or Affiliate
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, or any of such Person's Affiliates or immediate family members (each
of the foregoing, a "Related Party"), is a party to any Contract with or
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or has any interest in any property owned by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or has engaged in any transaction with any of the
foregoing within the last 12 months or that has continuing obligations, in
each case, that is of a type that would be required to be disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no former director or officer is party to any such
Contract that was not entered into on an arms-length basis (an "Affiliate
Transaction") that has not been so disclosed. Any Affiliate Transaction as of
the time it was entered into and as of the time of any amendment or renewal
thereof contained such terms, provisions and conditions as were at least as
favorable to the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries as would have been obtainable by the
Company in a similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party. To the
knowledge of the Company, no Related Party of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, on an individual or joint basis,
any material interest in, or serves as an officer or director or in another
similar capacity of, any supplier or other independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any organization which has a Contract
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 3.26 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person, other than Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. ("Macquarie"), the financial
advisor to the Company, and William Blair and Company, L.L.C. ("Blair"), the
financial advisor to the Special Committee, is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Section 3.26 of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (a) all transaction fees and expenses
(whether payable to financial advisory, legal, accounting or other providers)
that include a success fee or other premium or additional fee due as a result
of execution and delivery of this Agreement or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 3.27 Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the Company. The Company
Board has received the opinion of Macquarie to the effect that, subject to the
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered in
connection with the preparation of such opinion, as of the date of the meeting
of the Company Board at which this Agreement was approved by the Company
Board, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares in the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement, is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders of Shares. A true and complete informational copy of Macquarie's
written opinion will promptly be provided to Parent following its receipt by
the Company; it being acknowledged and agreed by Parent that it is not
entitled to use or rely on such opinion for any purpose.

shall constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there is or
has been, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (1) any condition, change, event,
occurrence or effect in the industry in which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries operates, or the United States or global economy, (2) changes,

of any of the foregoing on any relationships, contractual or otherwise, with
customers, suppliers, distributors, collaboration partners, stockholders,
lenders, employees or regulators (including without limitation, any
cancellations of or delays in customer or client agreements, any reduction in

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that, with
respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4), the impact of such event, change,

requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations

modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the
properties, assets or rights of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 under, or
give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or

heretofore made available to the Company, true and complete copies of all
reports and proxy statements required to be filed or furnished by Parent with
the SEC since December 31, 2011 (together, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date of this Agreement, then as of the date of such filing), the Parent
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, including, in
each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, applicable to
such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents filed with the
SEC as of their respective filing dates (or, if amended, the date of the
filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended)
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Documents
filed with the SEC (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in
all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting

form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC as then in effect with respect

promulgated by the SEC. Since December 31, 2011, Parent has not made any
material change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the
preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule
or policy or applicable Law. The books and records of Parent and its

(d) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports it
files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is
accumulated and made known to Parent's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(e) Since January 1, 2009, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,

partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,

Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined

including Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 482 of the Code.

Section 5.2 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Except
as permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
or authorize any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee,
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor,
agent or representative (collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-
public information with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (except to notify
any Person making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the

of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the obtaining of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (1) the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that was
unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2,
(2) the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (3) the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the
actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may, at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"); provided, that any non-public information
provided to any Person given such access shall have been previously provided
to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person and (y) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee or any other committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub) the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve, or
recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal or (C)
adopt a resolution or take any such actions (each such action set forth in
this Section 5.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) (A) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") that is, is intended to, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal or (B) adopt a resolution or agree to take any such
actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company Board (or, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
Special Committee) may, if the Company Board or Special Committee, as
applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
either (I) a Superior Proposal or (II) material changes in circumstances that
are not related to an Acquisition Proposal and were not known to the Company
Board or Special Committee nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board or
Special Committee as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (an
"Intervening Event") or (y) solely in response to a Superior Proposal received
after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.2,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i)
(including payment of the Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a
binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal as referred to above or enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement unless (1) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least
three Business Days before taking any such action of its intention to do so,
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of any Person making, such Superior Proposal,
and contemporaneously furnishing a copy of any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the
Company and a new two Business Day period commencing at the time of such new
notice), (2) the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Superior Proposal, (3) the Company has complied with its
obligations in the next sentence of this Section 5.2(b), and (4) prior to the
expiration of the applicable notice period, Parent does not make a bona fide
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement or, if Parent
has made such a proposal, the Company Board or Special Committee has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) such proposal does not either cause such initial Superior
Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal or cause the failure to terminate
this Agreement and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal no longer to be inconsistent with the
Company Board's or Special Committee's fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided further, that neither the Company Board nor Special Committee may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event as
referred to above unless (A) the Company provides Parent with written
information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it, (B) the Company keeps
Parent reasonably informed of developments with respect to such Intervening
Event, (C) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least three Business Days
before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons
therefor (it being understood and agreed that any material change to any of
the facts that are the basis of the proposed Adverse Recommendation Change
shall

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 require a new written notice by the Company and a new two Business Day
period commencing at the time of such new notice), (D) the Company has
complied with its obligations in the next sentence of this Section 5.2(b), and
(E) prior to the expiration of the applicable notice period, Parent does not
make a bona fide proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement
or, if Parent has made such a proposal, the Company Board or Special Committee
has determined (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisor) such proposal does not cause the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Charge no longer to be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. During the notice period prior to its
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement and
entering into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 5.2(a)
and (b), the Company promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt,
shall advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information, discussion or

such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company
shall keep Parent informed (in writing) in all material respects on a
reasonably prompt basis of the status and material terms (including, within 36
hours after the occurrence of any material amendment, modification,
development, discussion or negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request, inquiry, proposal or offer. Without limiting any of the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 5.2(a).

  

  

(d) The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section 5.2 by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
the Company. The Company shall notify its Representatives of the requirements
of this Section, and shall otherwise use its best efforts to ensure that all
Representatives comply with the terms hereof.

  

  

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Company's ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 5.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board or Special Committee from (i) taking and disclosing a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that in no event shall this Section 5.2(f) affect the obligations of
the Company specified in Sections 5.2(b) and (c); and provided further, that
any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
(including for purposes of Section 7.1(i)) unless the Company Board or Special
Committee expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, including any merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender
offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition,
binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction, (A) of assets or businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 20% or more of the net
revenues or net income or that represent 20% or more of the total assets
(based on fair market value), of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately prior to such transaction, (B) of 20% or more of any class
of capital stock, other equity security or voting power of the Company or any
resulting parent company of the Company or (C) involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, individually or taken together, whose businesses constitute
20% or more of the net revenues, net income or total assets (based on fair
market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
was unsolicited and did not otherwise involve a material breach of this
Section 5.2 that the Company Board or Special Committee determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(b) or otherwise); provided,
that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in
the term "Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent (with the Company's reasonable

the meeting of the stockholders of Parent to be called in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the "Form S-4"
means a registration statement on Form S-4, including a prospectus, in which
the Proxy Statement will form a part. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of such
parties shall thereafter promptly mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its
respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable. Each of Parent and the
Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or
applicable law related thereto.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other upon its, or one of
its Subsidiaries', receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4, shall consult with the other prior to responding to
any such comments or requests or filing any amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, and shall provide the other with copies of
all correspondence between such party and its Representatives on the one hand
and the SEC and its staff on the other hand. If any party hereto becomes aware
of any information that, pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4, then such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
thereof and shall cooperate with the other parties in filing such amendment or
supplement with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, in
mailing such amendment or supplement.

  

  

(c) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the
SEC or its staff with respect to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 will be
made by Parent or the Company without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon.

  

  

Section 5.4 Company Stockholders' Meeting; Parent Stockholders' Meeting.

  

  

(a) The Company shall take, in accordance with all applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to establish a
record date for, duly call and give notice of, and convene a meeting of
holders of the issued and outstanding Shares (the "Company Stockholders'
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company Stockholders' Meeting shall be convened as promptly as practicable
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement. Except in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company, through the Company Board (which may act
on the recommendation of the Special Committee), shall (i) recommend to its
Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

  

  

(b) If required under NASDAQ Rule 5635 or other applicable NASDAQ rules,
Parent shall take, in accordance with all applicable Law and its articles of

for, duly call and give notice of, and convene a

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

60

"Parent Stockholders' Meeting") for the sole purpose of approving the issuance
of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. If required, Parent
Stockholders' Meeting shall be convened as promptly as practicable following

issuance of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement to its
stockholders as required by this Section 5.4(b), Parent shall unless it
determines based on the advice of its outside counsel and its financial
advisors that doing so would constitute a breach of the Parent Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (i) recommend to its stockholders that
they approve such issuance, and (ii) include such recommendation in the proxy
statement in respect of such meeting.

  

  

Section 5.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their respective
properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including material
Tax Returns filed and those material Tax Returns in preparation along with the
relevant work papers of its auditors); provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not require the Company to disclose any information to the extent such
disclosure would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) contravene
applicable Law, (ii) breach or cause a default under any confidentiality
agreement with any third party entered into prior to the date hereof that
relate to any discussions regarding transactions of a nature similar to the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided, that disclosures required pursuant
to Section 5.2 with respect to a party to any such confidentiality agreement
or any proposals they may make shall not be limited by this Section 5.2(ii)),
or (iii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All such information shall be held
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Mutual Nondisclosure
Agreement between Parent and the Company dated as of May 30, 2013 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 or
information provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this
Agreement shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties
hereunder.

  

  

Section 5.6 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required
consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or
negotiations with, third parties, including as required under any Material
Contract, (ii) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities, make all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings and take all steps as may be

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Action by,
any Governmental Entity, including filings under the HSR Act with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice and any required foreign antitrust filings, (iii)
vigorously resist and contest any Action, including administrative or judicial
Action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, by vigorously pursuing all avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment of any material fee,
penalty or other consideration or make any other material concession, waiver
or amendment under any Contract in connection with obtaining any consent
without the prior written consent of Parent. Each of the parties hereto shall
furnish to each other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all
of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall
keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with
respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide information about itself and its Subsidiaries and access to
its employees and representatives to Parent's financing sources that Parent
has committed to make available pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (i) agree or
proffer to divest or hold separate (in trust or otherwise), or take any other
action with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Affiliates or, assuming the consummation of the Integrated Merger, the
Surviving Corporation, Surviving LLC or any of its Affiliates, (ii) agree or
proffer to limit in any manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of
ownership of any securities (including the Shares) or (iii) enter into any
agreement that in any way limits the ownership or operation of any business of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates, in each case if such action would be material to the business and
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the
value of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent after consummation of the
Integrated Merger.

Section 5.7 Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) take no
action to cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, use reasonable best efforts to
take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (c) any Action commenced or, to such party's
knowledge, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.9 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former officer
or director may have under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect
on the date of this Agreement in their capacity as such, from the Effective
Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC shall
indemnify and hold harmless each current (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) and each former officer and director of the Company from and
against any and all loss and liability suffered and expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the indemnified Person is or was an officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Company would have been required to
do so under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or DGCL (for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to the limitations on the Company's ability to indemnify its
directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL). In the event of any
such action, suit or proceeding, each such indemnified Person shall be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of such action,
suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC to the
fullest extent that the Company would be permitted to advance such expenses
under the DGCL. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving
LLC agrees, and Parent agrees to cause each of the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving LLC, to continue and not to repeal or modify, and agree to
include, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in its organizational
documents provisions for the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses of the current and former directors and officers of the Company as
currently existing in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws.

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent may (i)
substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Company's existing policies as
of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); and provided, further, that in no event
shall Parent or the Company be required to pay aggregate premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.9(b) in excess of 300% of the amount of the
aggregate premiums paid by the Company for policy year 2012-2013 for such
purpose (which policy year 2012-2013 premiums are hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Section 5.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger and the Second Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or
her legal representatives, and each such Person shall be an intended third
party beneficiary of the provisions of this Section 5.9, and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving LLC under this Section 5.9 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any indemnified Person to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless such
Person shall have consented thereto in writing.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving LLC, or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and/or the Surviving LLC shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or the Surviving LLC, as
the case may be, set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

  

Section 5.10 Tax Treatment.

  

  

(a) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub 2 intend that the Merger
and Second Merger, taken together as a single integrated transaction for US
federal income tax purposes, and along with the other transactions effected
pursuant to this Agreement, be treated, and each them shall use its best
efforts to cause the Merger and Second Merger, taken together as a single
integrated transaction for US federal income tax purposes, and along with the
other transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, to be treated, for US
federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(A)
of the Code (to which each of Parent and the Company are to be parties under
Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the Company is to

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 be treated as merging directly with and into Parent, with the Company Common
Stock converted in such merger into the right to receive the consideration
provided for hereunder, and each shall (i) take no action inconsistent with
such treatment, (ii) not fail to take any action necessary to preserve such
treatment, (iii) file all Tax Returns consistent with such treatment, and (iv)
take no position inconsistent with such treatment, in each case, unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub 2 hereby adopt this
Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

  

  

(c) The Company shall immediately notify Parent, if, at any time before the
Effective Time, the Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger and Second
Merger, taken together as a single integrated transaction for US federal
income tax purposes, and along with the other transactions effected pursuant
to this Agreement, from being treated as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code. On the date of the effectiveness of the Form S-4 and
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to counsel duly executed
certificates substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Company Tax Certificates"). Prior the Effective Time, the Company shall not
take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue any of the
representations set forth in the Company Tax Certificates.

  

  

(d) Parent shall immediately notify the Company, if, at any time before the
Effective Time, Parent becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger or Second Merger, taken
together as a single integrated transaction for US federal income tax
purposes, and along with the other transactions effected pursuant to this
Agreement, from being treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(A)
of the Code. On the date of the effectiveness of the Form S-4 and the Closing
Date, Parent shall deliver to counsel duly executed certificates substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Parent Tax Certificates").
Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall not take or cause to be taken
any action which would cause to be untrue any of the representations set forth
in the Parent Tax Certificates.

hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements (including announcements to the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any public announcement (including announcements to the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) without the prior consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system; provided, that Parent or the Company may
include disclosures relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated herein in its respective periodic filings with the
SEC without seeking consent from, or consulting with, the other party, so long
as such disclosures are substantially similar to the information contained in
previous

  

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by
Parent and the Company (or made individually by the Company or Parent, if
previously consented to by the other party); provided, further, that each of
Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry

releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company (or individually by a party, if previously consented to by the
other party); provided, further, that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.11 shall not apply to any release or public statement (x) made or
proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action
taken pursuant thereto or (y) in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

the Parent Shares and such other shares to be approved for listing on such
exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 5.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to such Shares) or acquisitions of Parent Shares resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16(b)(3) under the Exchange
Act.

  

  

Section 5.14 Further Assurances. Each party hereby agrees to perform any
further acts and to execute and deliver any documents or instruments that may
be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.15 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide
to each current (and, to the extent applicable, former) employee of the

collective bargaining or other labor contract, the terms and conditions of

Subsidiaries) (i) no less than the same level of annual base salary and wage

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the Company to
provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the one-year
period following the Closing Date with severance benefits at not less than the
levels and pursuant to the terms of any written employment agreements or offer
letters with the Company or its Subsidiaries; Company Employees without a
written employment agreement or offer letter providing severance shall be
subject to the respective severance plans, agreements and guidelines of the
Parent.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause an affiliate
to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the Company's
retention, termination and change in control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any written change in control severance
agreement, but excluding all other severance policies or plans other than

otherwise required by applicable law) and (iii) each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Closing Date to the
same extent as such Company Employee was entitled before the Closing Date to

immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (x) to the extent that any Company Plan, or any
Company Employee's participation or coverage thereunder, is terminated at any
time on or after the Closing Date, each affected Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent employee benefit plans providing, in the aggregate, substantially
similar participation or coverage as was provided under such Company Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date
(determined without regard for any amendment or termination of such Company
Plan pursuant to this Agreement). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to continue all plans of the Company, until the end of the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs, providing for flexible spending
contributions, deductibles, maximum out of pocket requirements and coinsurance
requirements that are measured on a plan year basis.

  

  

(d) With respect to any Company Employees based outside of the United States,

Schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Support Agreements, and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior written agreements, arrangements, communications and understandings
and all prior and contemporaneous oral agreements, arrangements,
communications and understandings among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

Section 8.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.9,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and

80  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

respective representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, in which
event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of its
stockholders (without duplication) shall be determined by reference to the
total amount that would have been recoverable by the holders of the Company
Common Stock if all such holders brought an action against Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Sub 2 and were recognized as intended third party beneficiaries
hereunder, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent, Merger Sub
and Merger Sub 2.

  

  

Section 8.7 Governing Law. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal

action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for

such stockholder approval of this Agreement, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that by law requires further approval or authorization by the
stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub without such further approval or
authorization. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in
writing signed by or on behalf of each of the Parties.

  

  

Section 8.18 Waiver. Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or any of the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) no waiver
that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (ii) no notice to or demand on one Party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that Party or of the right
of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (with respect
to the Company) and the Company (with respect to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
Sub 2), may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of such Party, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) waive
compliance with any covenants, obligations, or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party.
