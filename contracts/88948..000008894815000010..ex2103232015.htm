2.4 _Non-assignable Assets_.

  

(a) _Contracts_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt or
agreement to assign, transfer, sublease or sublicense any Assumed Contract
which cannot be assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed without the
consent or waiver of the third party or parties thereto (including any
federal, national, state, provincial, municipal or local government,
administrative or legislative body, governmental or regulatory agency or
authority, bureau, commission, court, department or other instrumentality or
other governmental entity of any country ("Governmental Authority")), unless
such consent or waiver shall have been obtained, or if such assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense or attempt to assign, transfer, sublease or
sublicense would constitute a breach thereof or a violation of any Law (as
defined below), this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment, transfer,
sublease or sublicense thereof, or an attempted assignment, transfer, sublease
or sublicense thereof. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consents and waivers of any other party required to
assign, convey, settle, deliver and transfer the Purchased Assets. In the
event that any consent, waiver or release, with respect to the foregoing is
not obtained, then the parties shall cooperate in any commercially reasonable
manner permitted to provide Buyer with all of the benefits enjoyed by Seller

convey, settle, deliver and transfer the Nontransferable Permits, or Buyer
shall apply for new permits from any Governmental Authority for which there
are Nontransferable Permits. In the event that any consent, waiver or release,
with respect to the foregoing is not obtained, then the parties shall
cooperate in any commercially reasonable manner permitted to provide Buyer
with all of the benefits enjoyed by Seller under the Nontransferable Permits
for which such consent or waiver has not been given, and that is not violative
of any Law, and Seller and Buyer shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts for one year after the Closing Date to obtain any remaining third
party consents with respect to such Nontransferable Permits, except where it
is a requirement of any Governmental Authority for Buyer to obtain a new
permit.

  

    

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

(a) _At Closing_. Three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement prepared by Seller calculating the difference
between the Inventory as of the Closing Date ("Closing Date Inventory") and
the Inventory set forth in _Schedule 1.1(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule _,_
attached hereto, determined at Cost on a First-In First-Out basis without
spare parts included, which is acknowledged by the parties to be
$94,000,000.00 ("Base Inventory") and the Purchase Price adjustment arising
from post-execution capital expenditures as contemplated under the last
sentence of this Sec. 2.5(a). The Closing Date Inventory value shall be
calculated and valued on the same basis as the Base Inventory. In the event
the Closing Date Inventory exceeds the Base Inventory, Buyer shall pay Seller
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price the amount of such difference. In the
event the Base Inventory exceeds the Closing Date Inventory, the amount of
such difference shall be deducted from the Purchase Price. The amount of such
adjustment, or deduction, as described in the prior two sentences, is referred
to as the "Inventory Adjustment." There shall also be an increase in the
Purchase Price for Seller\'s payments of capital expenditures for the Modesto
Business from the date of execution of this Agreement as set forth in Schedule
2.5(a).

  

(b) _Post-Closing_. The calculation set forth in Section 2.5(a) shall be
subject to the approval of Buyer. If Buyer does not approve of such
calculation, Buyer shall deliver to Seller notice of its disapproval within
forty-five (45) days of the Closing Date along with a statement prepared by
Buyer calculating the difference between the Closing Date Inventory and the
actual Inventory as of the Closing Date, calculated and valued on the same
basis as the Base Inventory ("Actual Closing Date Inventory"). In the event
the Closing Date Inventory exceeds the Actual Closing Date Inventory, Seller
shall pay Buyer as an adjustment to the Purchase Price the amount of such
difference within ten (10) days of the agreement between the parties as to
such amount. In the event the Actual Closing Date Inventory exceeds the
Closing Date Inventory, Buyer shall pay Seller as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price the amount of such difference within ten (10) days of the
agreement between the parties as to such amount.

  

    

(c) For purposes of this Section 2.5, the "Cost" of the Inventory shall mean
the cost as determined pursuant to and set forth in _Schedule 1.1(g)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

ARTICLE III 
  
  
  EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

  

3.1 _Business Employees and Employment_. The term "Business Employees" shall
refer to all employees of Seller who are employed by Seller in the Modesto
Business on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  

(a) On the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate the employment of all Business
Employees subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between California
Processors, Inc. and Teamsters California State Council of Cannery and Food
Processing Unions, International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("Collective
Bargaining Agreement"). Buyer shall offer to all Business Employees who are
subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement employment effective
immediately upon the termination of such bargaining unit employees by Seller,
on the Closing Date. Such offers will be for employment on terms consistent
with the Collective Bargaining Agreement, including, without limitation, its
terms pertaining to wages, pensions and health and welfare benefits. Buyer
shall assume the Collective Bargaining Agreement on the Closing Date.

  

(b) On the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate the employment of all Business
Employees who are not subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, except
those Business Employees listed on Schedule 3.1 - Seller Retained Business
Employees. Buyer shall offer to all such non-bargaining unit employees not
designated on Schedule 3.1 - Seller Retained Business Employees, employment
effective immediately upon their termination by Seller, on the Closing Date.
The offers of employment to such non-bargaining unit employees (i) shall be at
hourly wage rates or salaries substantially similar to those which Buyer
provides to its similarly-situated California-based employees and (ii) shall
provide benefits substantially comparable in the aggregate to those which
Buyer provides to its similarly-situated California-based employees.

  

(c) Any Business Employees who accept the offer of employment by Buyer,
described in Subsections 3.1 (a) and (b), are referred to herein as
"Transferred Employees." Following the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall use its
best efforts to ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with
respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health or actively-at-work exclusions are applicable to any Transferred
Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans
in which such Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate and (ii)
Buyer shall use its best efforts to provide or cause to be provided that any
costs or expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees (and their respective
dependents and beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing Date shall be
specifically applied for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or
limitations on coverage under any such welfare benefit plans. Seller shall
deliver to Buyer on or before the Closing Date all personnel files and
employment records relating to the Transferred Employees to the extent
permitted by Law (including completed I-9 forms and attachments with respect
to all Transferred Employees, except for such Business Employees as Seller
certifies in writing are exempt from such requirement). During the period
between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to continue the employment of all Business
Employees, and (ii) Buyer shall have reasonable access to the Business
Employees in order to make the related offers of employment, which offers will
be contingent upon the consummation of the Closing. In the event Buyer does
not offer any Business Employees, except those Business Employees listed on
Schedule 3.1 - Seller Retained Business Employees, an offer of employment
substantially similar to the position in which they are employed as of the day
prior to the Closing Date, or if any of the Business Employees are not offered
employment from Buyer, then Buyer shall be responsible for payment of
severance pay to each of the affected Business Employees in accordance with
Seller\'s standard severance policy.

  

    

3.2 _Employment_. Seller and Buyer shall adopt the "standard procedure" for
preparing and filing IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements) and Forms W-4
(Employee\'s Withholding Allowance Certificate) regarding the Transferred
Employees. Under this procedure, Seller shall keep on file all IRS Forms W-4
provided by the Transferred Employees for the period required by applicable
Law concerning record retention and Buyer will obtain new IRS Forms W-4 with
respect to each Transferred Employee. On the Closing Date, Seller shall pay
out all compensation earned by each Transferred Employee through the Closing
Date, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses and other incentive
payments, and severance and other termination payments, but shall not pay out
accrued vacation and other paid time off of the Transferred Employees, and
Buyer shall receive, as a credit toward the Purchase Price, the accrued
amounts retained on the books of the Seller for payment of such expenses.
Buyer shall not be liable for any benefits of any kind or nature accrued by
the employee for any services rendered to Seller or otherwise arising on or
before the Closing Date, including but not limited to any obligations
associated with any employee benefits plans, except as provided herein, nor
shall Buyer assume any employment contract of an employee of Seller unless an
Assumed Contract. Buyer shall not be liable for any obligation, liability or
cost associated with the termination by Seller of any employee or consultant
of Seller prior to the Closing Date, except as provided in Sec. 3.4 herein. In
the event Buyer does not offer any Business Employees, except those Business
Employees listed on Schedule 3.1 - Seller Retained Business Employees, an
offer of employment substantially similar in duties and compensation to the
position in which they are employed as of the day prior to the Closing Date,
then Buyer shall be responsible for payment of severance pay to each of the
affected Business Employees not offered such employment, in accordance with
Seller\'s standard severance policy.

  

3.3 _Non-Solicitation_. Seller agrees that it will not directly or indirectly
solicit any of the Business Employees hired by Buyer to leave their employment
with Buyer or to perform work for any entity other than Buyer for a period of
one year following the Closing Date.

  

3.4 _WARN Act_. Because it is assumed that substantially fewer than 50
Business Employees will become unemployed as a result of this Agreement, the
WARN Act would not apply. However, if the WARN Act would apply, Seller shall
be solely responsible for compliance with the WARN Act and for making
payments, if any, and paying all penalties and costs, if any, which result
solely from termination of employment of Business Employees or failure to
provide adequate advance notice of the termination of any Business Employee
and/or government entities by Seller on or before the Closing Date; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the preceding clause, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for compliance with the WARN Act with respect to Seller\'s
termination of the employment of the Business Employees on the Closing Date
and for making payments, if any, and paying all penalties and costs, if any,
which result from Buyer\'s failure to provide or offer employment
substantially similar in duties and compensation to the position in which they
are employed as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for compliance with the WARN Act and for making payments, if any,
and paying all penalties and costs, if any, which result from failure to
provide or offer employment on substantially the same terms and conditions as
the Business Employees received on the day prior to the Closing Date. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for compliance with the WARN Act and for making
payments, if any, based in whole or in part on layoffs, terminations or other
employment loss of any Business Employees after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any claims brought against it under the
federal and/or California WARN Acts, respectively 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2101 et seq. and
Cal. Lab. Code Â§ 1400 et seq. (collectively, the "WARN Act"), because of
Buyer\'s failure to make offers to Business Employees as required by Section
3.1 herein, or which result from failure to provide or offer employment
substantially similar in duties and compensation as the Business Employees
received on the day prior to the Closing Date.

  

    

3.5 _ERISA Compliance_. Seller shall be solely responsible for compliance with
the continuation coverage provisions of ERISA with respect to any events
occurring prior to or coincident with the Closing Date. Specifically, and
without limitation, Seller shall provide each Business Employee who is a
participant in Seller\'s group health plan or plans with notice of their right
to continuation coverage, on account of their termination of coverage from
Seller\'s group health plan or plans associated with this transaction, and
Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage to any
qualified beneficiary (as defined in ERISA) who elects and is entitled to
continuation coverage on account of any qualifying event (as defined in ERISA)
occurring prior to or coincident with the Closing Date, even if the election
of such continuation coverage occurs after the Closing Date. Seller also shall
be responsible for providing continuation coverage or any other coverage
associated with continuation coverage to any qualified beneficiary or spouse
or dependent of a qualified beneficiary who becomes entitled to such coverage
on account of an event occurring after the Closing Date, if the entitlement is
based on the qualified beneficiary\'s receipt of continuation coverage from
Seller.

  

3.6 _Construction_. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 - Business Employees and Employment
hereof are solely for the purpose of defining the obligations between Buyer
and Seller concerning the Business Employees and shall in no way be construed
as creating any employment contract or other contract between Buyer or Seller
and any Business Employee, or as granting any third-party beneficiary status
to any Business Employee. This Subsection 3.6 is not intended to affect
Buyer\'s obligation to assume the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as set
forth in Subsection 3.1(a).

  

3.7 Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Fund. Buyer and Seller intend to
comply with Section 4204(a)(1)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (as amended)(ERISA) and to take any other actions required or
desirable so that no withdrawal liability is imposed on Seller as a result of
the transaction contemplated by the Agreement or any subsequent action or
omission of Buyer. Accordingly, Buyer and Seller agree as follows:

  

    

(a) Buyer agrees to make contributions after the Closing Date to the Western
Conference of Teamsters Pension Fund ("Pension Fund") with respect to the
operations of the Modesto Business, for substantially the same number of
contribution base units for which Seller has an obligation prior to the
Closing Date to contribute to the Pension Fund, as described in Section
4204(a)(1)(A) of ERISA, and;

  

(b) Seller and Buyer will take all necessary steps, including complying with
the provisions of Section 4204 of ERISA, to prevent the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from being treated as a full or partial
withdrawal from the Pension Fund;

  

(c) Prior to the first plan year of the Pension Fund beginning after the
Closing Date, Seller and Buyer jointly shall seek a variance from the
requirements of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA that a bond be obtained or an
amount be held in escrow as provided in said Section, and Section
4204(a)(1)(C) of ERISA relating to the language in section (e) below. In the
event the Pension Fund determines that the request does not qualify for a
variance, Buyer shall obtain any required bond or establish any required
escrow as of the first plan year beginning after the Closing Date and shall
maintain such bond or escrow until the earliest of (A) the date a variance is
obtained from the Pension Fund; (B) the date a variance or exemption is
obtained from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"); or (C) the
last day of the fifth plan year commencing after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
pay, or reimburse or indemnify, as the case may be, Seller for the cost of
such application for variance and the cost of any bond or escrow that may be
required hereunder, and such obligation to reimburse and indemnify shall not
be subject to any limitations set forth in Article XIII hereof;

  

(d) If, at any time during the first five plan years of the Pension Fund
beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer withdraws from the Pension Fund or
fails to make a contribution when due to the Pension Fund, the amount of the
bond, escrow or letter of credit will be paid to the Pension Fund;

  

(e) If a variance as described in section (c) is not obtained, the following
language shall be applicable: If, during the first five plan years of the
Pension Fund beginning after the Closing Date, Buyer withdraws from the
Pension Fund in a complete or partial withdrawal with respect to operations of
the Modesto Business, Seller will be secondarily liable for any withdrawal
liability it would have had to the Pension Fund with respect to the Modesto
Business but for this Agreement, if and to the extent the liability of Buyer
with respect to the Pension Fund is not paid either by Buyer or pursuant to
the bond, escrow or letter of credit described in subsection (c) above;

  

(f) Buyer agrees that it shall be liable to Seller and shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless Seller and all entities that are under common
control with Seller (within the meaning of ERISA Section 4001(b)(1)) from any
liability or secondary liability to the Pension Fund and any related losses,
claims, costs, damages, or expenses, including reasonable legal expenses, it
or they may incur, arising out of any failure by Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under this section 5.7 or by any failure by Buyer to pay its
contributions or withdrawal liability when due. Seller agrees to provide
Buyer, as soon as reasonably practicable, with a copy of any notice received
by Seller relating to the imposition of withdrawal liability by the Pension
Fund for which Seller asserts Buyer may be liable. In the event Buyer
withdraws from the Pension Fund in a complete or partial withdrawal during the
plan year in which the Closing occurs or during the next four plan years, due
to circumstances beyond Buyer\'s control (such as a decertification, or
significant legal or financial issues impacting the Pension Fund), Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of Buyer\'s withdrawal liability
attributable to Seller\'s contribution history assumed by Buyer as a result of
Section 4204 of ERISA\'s application to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and such obligation to reimburse shall not be subject to any
limitations set forth in Article XIII hereof.

  

    

(g) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
will cooperate to fulfill any requirements the Pension Fund may set, in order
to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement comply with
Section 4204 of ERISA.

  

  

ARTICLE IV 
  
  
  DUE DILIGENCE

  

4.1 _Due Diligence_.

  

(a) _Due Diligence Period_. Buyer will have until 5 p.m. on May 1, 2015 (the
"Due Diligence Deadline") to conduct a due diligence investigation of the
Purchased Assets to its satisfaction in its sole discretion, which
investigation shall consist of and may include, among other things, review of
the condition of the Real Property, the Preliminary Title Reports, roof,
plumbing, electrical, sprinkler, water, sewer, drainage, mechanical,
engineering, heating and air conditioning and life safety systems, structural
integrity of the Improvements, measurement of the square footage of the Land
and Improvements, legal status and requirements pertaining to the Real
Property and the Modesto Business (including use permits, building codes,
zoning, environmental, public health and fire safety laws), hazardous
substance review including preparation of an environmental assessment, the
Inventory, the Personal Property, the Intellectual Property, and all other
matters of significance to Buyer relating to the Purchased Assets. Buyer shall
not perform any destructive or intrusive testing of any of the Purchased
Assets, including the Real Property, without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent may be withheld in Seller\'s sole and absolute
discretion. In the event Buyer is unable to complete its due diligence
investigation to its satisfaction in its sole discretion by the Due Diligence
Deadline despite reasonable efforts by Buyer, Buyer will have the right to
extend the Due Diligence Deadline for such number of days as is required to
complete its due diligence investigation but in no event more than 15 days
from the original Due Diligence Deadline. Buyer will order and pay for all
costs and expenses with respect to such investigations. If, prior to the Due
Diligence Deadline, as may be extended pursuant to the foregoing, Buyer
notifies Seller both in writing and with a telephone call from Buyer\'s CEO to
Seller\'s CEO that Buyer disapproves the Purchased Assets for any material
reason, the Purchased Assets will be deemed disapproved, and this Agreement
and all exclusivity obligations of Seller will terminate.

  

(b) _Access_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall afford Buyer and authorized
representatives of Buyer reasonable access, at reasonable times, to the
Purchased Assets, including without limitation the Real Property, for the
purposes of satisfying Buyer with respect to the Purchased Assets. Seller
shall furnish to Buyer and its representatives all documents, files, financial
and operating data, books, records, inventory, and any other information
(including Tax records, and accounting records and work papers) related to the
Purchased Assets and the Modesto Business as Buyer or its representatives may
from time to time request. In performing its examinations and inspections of
the Modesto Business and the Purchased Assets, Buyer will use reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with Seller\'s operation of its Modesto
Business and use of the Purchased Assets.

  

    

4.2 _Title_.

  

(a) _Preliminary Title Report_. Seller shall instruct the Title Company to
promptly issue a current preliminary title report for each parcel of the Real
Property (the "Preliminary Title Report"), within three (3) business days of
the Effective Date, together with a copy of each document referred to in each
Preliminary Title Report, and copies of any existing easements, covenants,
restrictions, agreements, and other documents which affect title to the Land
and are not disclosed by the applicable Preliminary Title Report, if any.

  

(b) _Title Review._ Buyer will notify Seller in writing, by the end of the Due
Diligence Period, of any objections Buyer has to title to the Real Property.
If Buyer does not provide written notice of any such objections within that
period, the title reflected in the Preliminary Title Report will be deemed
disapproved.

  

(c) _Permitted Exceptions._ If Buyer disapproves of any title exception as
described above, Seller will have three (3) business days after receipt of
written notice of the disapproved exception(s) to notify Buyer that Seller
will attempt to have the disapproved exception(s) removed prior to Closing or
insured over or that Seller will not cause the exception to be removed or
insured over. Seller\'s failure to deliver such notice will be deemed to mean
that the exception(s) will not be removed or insured over. If Seller elects,
or is deemed to have elected, not to have any disapproved exception removed or
insured over, Buyer will have three (3) business days from the receipt of
Seller\'s notice either to (i) to have the disapproved exception removed or
insured over, or (ii) to __ waive its disapproval of such exception(s) and
agree to purchase the Real Property subject to the disapproved exception(s).
Buyer\'s failure to have the exception removed or insured over or to deliver
such notice will be deemed an election of Buyer to terminate this Agreement.
All exceptions that Buyer has approved hereunder, either by Buyer\'s actual
approval or actual waiver of a disapproval, will be termed the "Permitted
Exceptions". If Seller elects, in its sole discretion, to have a disapproved
exception removed or insured over to Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction, Seller
will be obligated to use diligent, good faith efforts to have that exception
removed or insured over to Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction, and if Seller
cannot have the exception removed or insured over to Buyer\'s reasonable
satisfaction, by the Closing, Seller will so notify Buyer, and Buyer will have
the right either to (a) terminate this Agreement, (b) have the exception
removed or insured over to Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction, and proceed to
the Closing, or (c) waive its disapproval of that exception and purchase the
Real Property subject to it.

  

4.3 _Indemnification Obligation_. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless and be responsible for any damage caused by any act or omission of
Buyer or its agents in connection with the investigations described in this
Article IV. This indemnification obligation shall survive Closing or
termination of this Agreement.

subject to the due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer and any
other parties hereto and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent and
concurrent to Seller\'s obligations hereunder, constitutes the legal, valid

limiting creditors\' rights. Except as may be required by the Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice, no consent, approval or
authorization of any third party or of any Governmental Authority or entity is
required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by Seller or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated

of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, do not and will not:

a "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, event, circumstance or
effect that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to
the Modesto Business, including its future prospects, taken as a whole,
excluding any such change, event, circumstance or effect arising out of or in
connection with or resulting from: (A) adverse developments in economic,
business or financial conditions generally affecting the processed fruit

(a) Seller has not experienced (i) any material damage, destruction or loss
adversely affecting the Purchased Assets or the Modesto Business, or (ii) any
change that would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Purchased Assets, the business, financial condition or operations of the
Modesto Business; or the Seller\'s relationships with its growers, customers,

stocks due to short produce pack as described in Schedule 5.5(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule; and

  

    

(j) Seller has not taken, or agreed in writing or otherwise to take, any of

(a) Section 5.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all material leases
entered into by Seller relating to the Modesto Business or the Purchased
Assets for any personal property to which Seller is a party as a lessee
("Leased Personal Property"), which leases are in full force and effect, and
binding on the parties thereto and neither Seller nor, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
any other party to such leases is in breach of the provisions thereof. No
default of Seller that has not been cured is outstanding nor, to Seller\'s
Knowledge, has any event occurred which, with the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both, would constitute a default of Seller thereunder. As
of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened
action that would materially interfere with the quiet enjoyment of such
leaseholds by Seller.

  

(b) Seller has good and valid title to and has the right to possession to all
the Personal Property, free and clear of any and all mortgages, liens,
pledges, charges, security interests, licenses, options, rights of first
refusal, rights of use, conditions, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind
or character, whether or not relating to the extension of credit or the
borrowing of money (collectively, "Liens"), except minor imperfections of
title, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, materially reduces the
value of or impairs the use of the affected properties or impairs the
operations of the Modesto Business or Liens that will be terminated prior to
or as of the Closing Date ("Permitted Liens").

  

(c) Except with respect to the main computer operating systems utilized by the
Modesto Business, the Purchased Assets constitute substantially all of the

wear and tear excepted), and is adequate and suitable for immediate use in the
ordinary course of business.

  

5.7 _Real Property_.

  

(a) The Real Property is in all material respects fully licensed, permitted
and authorized to carry on the Modesto Business as it has been carried on at
all times by Seller under all applicable Laws, including without limitation
zoning or land use requirements, rules and regulations, and no portion of the
Real Property or the current use thereof constitutes a non-conforming use. To
Seller\'s Knowledge, there are no circumstances, conditions or reasons which
are likely to be the basis for any proceedings to revoke or suspend any
Permits relating to the Real Property. Except as listed on Schedule 5.7(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule, Seller has not received any written notice or
information regarding the Real Property\'s failure to comply with or violation
of any applicable Law from any Governmental Authority or any restrictive
easements or covenants affecting the Real Property. To Seller\'s Knowledge,
there is no condemnation action, litigation or environmental, zoning,
moratorium, or other land-use proceedings, either instituted or planned to be
instituted or threatened, which would affect the use or occupancy of the Real
Property, or operation of the Modesto Business thereon, nor has Seller
received notice of any special assessment proceedings affecting the Real
Property. There are no outstanding options or rights of first offer or refusal
to purchase or lease the Real Property or any portion thereof or interest
therein. Except for Permitted Exceptions, no portion of the Real Property
serves any adjoining property for any purpose. There are no leases, subleases,
licenses, concessions or other agreements, written or oral, granting to any
person the right of use or occupancy of any portion of the Real Property,
except as set forth in Section 5.7 (a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

    

(b) The Real Property is supplied with utilities and other services in such
amounts as are reasonably necessary for its historical and current use in the

accordance with all applicable Laws, and adequate access that complies with
all applicable Laws is provided via public roads or via permanent,
irrevocable, appurtenant easements benefiting the Real Property.

  

(c) The buildings and other Improvements located on the Real Property, and all
such items are being sold "AS-IS, WHERE IS", except as otherwise specifically
set forth herein. To Seller\'s Knowledge, (i) there are no material defects to
the buildings or other Improvements located on the Real Property, and all such
items are in good operating condition and repair and in compliance with all
applicable Laws, and (ii) there are no wetlands in or upon the Real Property,
nor any endangered, threatened or special status species.

  

(d) There is no pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened action relating
to the Real Property or its Improvements that would materially interfere with
the quiet enjoyment of such by Buyer.

Governmental Authorities (including Permits) required in connection with the
ownership and operation of the Modesto Business and have been operated and
maintained in compliance with all applicable Laws.

or other casualty since October 1, 2014 which has not heretofore been
completely repaired and restored to its original condition.

performed or complied with after the Closing Date shall not be subject to any
limitation period unless otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement. The
right of indemnification or other claims against an Indemnifying Party with
respect to claims made prior to the Survival Date shall continue until final
resolution of such claim.

  

    

13.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to Section 13.1 - Survival of
Representations, Warranties and Covenants and Section 13.6 - Limitations on
Indemnification, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from any and
all losses (including diminution in value), claims, damages, liabilities,
Taxes, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, adjustments, costs
and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys\' and
experts\' fees and expenses of investigation) excluding any and all
consequential losses and any and all consequential and special damages
("Losses") arising or resulting directly or indirectly from or in connection
with:

  

(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
("Representations") made by Seller in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule
or other schedules attached hereto, or any other ancillary agreement or
certificate (altogether, the "Ancillary Documents") executed or entered into
or delivered by Seller in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(b) Any breach or violation of any covenant, agreement or obligation made by
Seller in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or any other Ancillary
Document executed or entered into or delivered by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement;

  

(c) Any liability for Taxes arising out of the operation of the Modesto
Business prior to the Closing Date;

  

(d) Any brokerage or finder\'s fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been made, by any
person with Seller (or any person acting on their behalf) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(e) To the extent arising from or relating to Seller\'s conduct of the Modesto
Business prior to the Closing Date; and

  

(f) To the extent arising from or relating to any Excluded Asset or Retained
Liability.

  

13.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to Section 13.1 - Survival of
Representations, Warranties and Covenants and Section 13.6 - Limitations on
Indemnification, Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any and
all Losses arising or resulting directly or indirectly from or in connection
with:

  

(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any Representation made by Buyer in this
Agreement, the schedules attached hereto, or any Ancillary Document executed
or entered into or delivered by Buyer in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(b) Any breach or violation of any covenant, agreement, or obligation made by
Buyer in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or any other Ancillary
Document executed or entered into or delivered by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement;

  

    

(c) Any brokerage or finder\'s fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been made, by any
person with Buyer (or any person acting on their behalf) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(d) To the extent arising from or relating to Buyer\'s conduct of the Modesto
Business after the Closing Date; and

  

(e) To the extent arising from or relating to any Purchased Assets after the
Closing Date or Assumed Liabilities.

  

13.4 _Claims_. Any party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give the party from whom indemnification is requested (the "Indemnifying
Party") written notice as soon as reasonably quantifiable after the
Indemnified Party has received notice or knowledge of the matter that has
given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement.
Such notice shall state the amount of Losses, if known, and the method of
computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed. The failure of the Indemnified Party to notify
the Indemnifying Party in a timely manner of the matter to which the
indemnification set forth in this Section relates shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. With respect to any
Losses arising from any third party claim (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice soon as
reasonably quantifiable after receiving notice of any Third Party Claim. The
failure of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party in a timely
manner of the claim to which the indemnification set forth in this Section
relates shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense of
such Third Party Claim through counsel of its choice and at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. Throughout the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall consult with the Indemnifying Party, keep the
indemnifying Party informed of the progress and strategy of the claim and use
commercially reasonable efforts to take the Indemnifying Party\'s input with
respect to the progress and strategy of the claim into account.

  

13.5 _Effect of Investigation_ _._ The right to indemnification,
reimbursement, or other remedy based on the representations, warranties,
covenants, and obligations contained in this Agreement shall not be affected
by any investigation (including any tax or environmental investigation or
assessment) conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or
obligation. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall be required to indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer under this Article XIII with respect to claims for Losses
arising under Section 13.2(a) only if the aggregate amount of such Losses
suffered or incurred by Buyer for all such matters exceeds Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Basket"), but in the event that such amount is
exceeded, the Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to all
Losses incurred from the first dollar. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall be required to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller under this Article XIII with respect to claims for Losses
arising under Section 13.3(a) only if the aggregate amount of such Losses
suffered or incurred by Seller for all such matters exceeds the Basket, but in
the event that such amount is exceeded, Seller shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to all Losses incurred from the first dollar. The
cap on any indemnification is $20,000,000.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Basket shall not apply with respect to indemnification claims for Losses
of the Buyer under Section 13.2 or Losses of the Seller under Section 13.3
which arise out of or result from an intentional breach or the inaccuracy of
any of the Representations.

  

    

ARTICLE XIV 
  
  
  DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION

  

14.1 _Damage or Destruction_. In the event of damage to or destruction of the
Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
Buyer may elect to either (i) terminate this Agreement upon written notice to
Seller if the damage and destruction is a Material Loss (as hereinafter
defined), or (ii) consummate this Agreement, in which event Seller shall pay
or credit to Buyer any and all insurance proceeds payable by reason of such
damage or destruction plus the amount of the deductible, or shall assign
Seller\'s rights to such proceeds to Buyer. As used herein, "Material Loss"
means any damage or destruction of the Purchased Assets in an amount of
$1,000,000 or more prior to the Closing Date or that will materially interfere
with the conduct of the Modesto Business after the Closing.

  

14.2 _Eminent Domain_. If, prior to the Closing, all of the Real Property is
taken by eminent domain, this Agreement will be deemed canceled. If only part
of the Real Property is so taken, Buyer shall have the option of (a)
proceeding with the Closing and acquiring the Purchased Assets as affected by
such taking, together with all compensation and damage awarded or the right to
receive same, or (b) if the taking is a Material Loss, terminating this
Agreement. If Buyer elects option (a) above, Seller agrees to assign to Buyer
at the Closing its rights to such compensation and damages, and will not
settle any proceedings relating to such taking without Buyer\'s prior written
consent. Seller shall promptly (and in any event prior to the Closing) notify
Buyer of any actual or threatened condemnation affecting the Real Property.

  

ARTICLE XV 
  
  
  MISCELLANEOUS

  

15.1 _Assignment_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall assign its rights or
delegate its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
other party; provided, however, that Buyer shall be permitted to assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any entity
controlled by or under common control with Buyer, without Seller\'s consent.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, devisees, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors
and assigns. In connection with any approved or permitted assignment by Buyer,
the assignee shall assume the assignor\'s obligations hereunder but assignor
shall nevertheless remain liable for such obligations.

  

    

15.2 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule and Exhibits attached hereto) and the other writings referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto contain the entire understanding of the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, interviews, discussions, correspondence, memoranda and
understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
The parties acknowledge and agree that they may not and are not relying on any
representation, promise, inducement, or other statement, whether oral or
written and by whomever made, that is not contained expressly in this
Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument duly
executed by the parties. Whenever the term "including" is used in this
document, it shall be deemed to mean including without limitation the matters
following thereafter. As used in this Agreement, the meanings of any and all
defined terms shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural
forms of each term so defined.

  

15.3 _Interpretation_. All parties have been represented by counsel in the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be
construed according to the fair meaning of its language. The rule of
construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party shall not be employed in interpreting this Agreement.

  

15.4 _Headings_. The article and section headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

15.5 _Notices_. All notices, claims, certificates, requests, demands and other
communications which are required or permitted to be given to any party
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given only if delivered
personally, sent by facsimile during business hours (promptly followed by a
hard-copy delivered in accordance with this Section 15.5), deposited in the
U.S. Express Mail or with another recognized courier for delivery not later
than the next business day, or if mailed by registered or certified mail,

15.6 _Further Assurances_. The parties hereby agree to execute such other
documents and perform such other acts as may be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, whether before or after Closing,
upon the request of the other party, to vest Buyer with full title to the
Purchased Assets, and otherwise to effect the purposes of this Agreement.

  

    

15.7 _Confidentiality; Return of Documents_.

  

(a) Each party agrees that the terms of the Confidentiality and Nonâ€‘Disclosure
Agreement executed by the parties dated February 2, 2015 shall remain in
effect and shall be incorporated herein as if set forth herein. Following the
execution of this Agreement, the parties shall jointly prepare and approve any
press releases concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other agreements contemplated herein, the parties hereto with respect to
the Modesto Business or the Purchased Assets, and such other communications to
clients, growers and members of the trade with respect to the Modesto
Business, as they mutually agree, which such releases and communications shall
not disclose transaction values.

  

(b) If the transactions described in this Agreement are not consummated: (i)
each party will promptly return to the other party or destroy all documents,
contracts, records or properties of or with respect to the other party or its
business or assets; (ii) no disclosure of the transaction proposed hereby
shall be made by one party without the prior written approval of the other
party, except as may be required by Law; and (iii) any party intending to make
any disclosure required by Law shall notify and consult with the other party
in advance. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of
this Agreement for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt nothing in this
Section 15.7 shall prevent or limit Buyer\'s ability to use the Purchased
Assets or otherwise conduct the Modesto Business following the Closing.

  

15.8 _Certain Tax Matters_. Each party agrees to furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other party, upon request and as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets or the
Modesto Business, including without limitation access to books and records, as
is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by the other party,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax in connection with the transactions anticipated
by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated herein or otherwise in
connection with the Modesto Business or the Purchased Assets. Each party shall
cooperate with each of the other parties in the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding relating to such Taxes.

  

15.9 _Publicity_. The parties agree that, except as otherwise required by law,
the issuance of any reports, statements or releases pertaining to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited
to disclosure of price, terms or other agreements on or prior to the Closing
Date is subject to prior mutual consent in writing.

  

15.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each
such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all
such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. A signed copy
of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

  

15.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable, and if any part of any provision is held illegal, void or invalid
under applicable Laws, such provision may be changed to the extent reasonably
necessary to make the provision, as so changed, legal, valid and binding. If
any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, void or invalid in its
entirety, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired but shall remain binding in accordance with their terms.

  

    

15.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any and all claims or controversies
arising out of or relating to the parties\' respective rights and
responsibilities under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws, and shall
be tried and litigated only in the state courts located in Modesto, CA and
federal court located in Sacramento, California for the Eastern District of
California. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal and
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waives the right to assert the
doctrine of "forum non conveniens" or to otherwise object to jurisdiction or
venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance with or arising
out of or relating to this Agreement.

  

15.13 _IRS Form 1099-S Designation_. In order to comply with information
reporting requirements of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, the parties agree
(i) to execute an IRS Form 1099-S Designation Agreement to designate the Title
Company ("Designee") as the party who shall be responsible for reporting the
contemplated sale of the Purchased Assets to the Internal Revenue Service on
IRS Form 1099-S; and (ii) to provide the Designee with the information
necessary to complete Form 1099-S.

  

15.14 _Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by the party to be charged with such waiver. The
waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

  

15.15 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly stated herein, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective
successors and assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring, and are
not intended to confer, any rights on any other Person.

  

15.16 _Attorneys\' Fees_. If there is any litigation or arbitration between
the parties related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\', accountants\' and
other professional fees and expenses).
