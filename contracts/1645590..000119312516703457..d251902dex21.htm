consummate an offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") shares of Seattle
Common Stock for outstanding shares of Houston Common Stock and, in the event
that Houstons shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Seattle Common
Stock in the Exchange Offer, Houston will distribute, _pro rata_ to its
shareholders, any unsubscribed Seattle Common Stock on the Distribution Date
immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer (the "Clean-Up
Spin-Off") and (b) exchange all of the outstanding shares of Seattle Class B
Common Stock for all of the outstanding shares of Common-Equivalent Houston
Preferred Stock pursuant to the Subsidiary Stock Exchange;

 

(6) the disposition by Houston of 100% of the Seattle Common Stock, whether by
way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up

Subsidiary Stock Exchange, is referred to as the "Distribution", and the
Distribution together with the Reorganization is referred to as

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Seattle, Intermediate Holdco, Merger Sub or any holder of the capital
stock of Houston, Seattle, Intermediate Holdco, Merger Sub or Miami:

 

(a) Seattle Capital Stock and Merger Sub Common Stock

 

(i) Each share of Seattle Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with  _Section

number of ADSs and/or, subject to _Section 3.3_, a fraction of an ADS, equal

(ii) Each share of Seattle Common Stock held by Seattle as treasury stock or
by Miami, Intermediate Holdco or Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior

3.1_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and any dividends or

(iv) The Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be

shall be construed to permit Houston, Seattle or Miami to take any action

Agreement.

 



24 ##### Table of Contents

  

(v) Each share of Seattle Class B Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time.

(vi) At the Effective Time, all of the shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into an aggregate number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation equal to
the number of shares of Seattle Common Stock converted into the right to
receive ADSs pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(ii)_.

 

(vii) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Intermediate Holdco shall
issue to Miami a number of fully paid nonassessable shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Intermediate Holdco ("Intermediate Holdco Common
Stock") as determined by Miami and Intermediate Holdco in consideration for
the payment by Miami of the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Miami Common Stock

 

Each share of Miami Common Stock and share of Intermediate Holdco Common Stock
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to and at the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time.

(c) Exchange Ratio Adjustment

 

If the percentage of outstanding shares of Miami Common Stock represented by
ADSs to be received in the Merger by former holders of Seattle Common Stock
with respect to Qualified Seattle Common Stock would be less than 50.1% of all
shares of Miami Common Stock outstanding immediately following the
consummation of the Merger (determined (i) after giving effect to the issuance
of all shares of Miami Common Stock represented by ADSs and underlying shares
of Miami Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and (ii)
without regard to any adjustment pursuant to this sentence) (the
"Threshold Percentage"), then upon Houstons election, the Exchange Ratio
shall be increased such that the number of shares of Miami Common Stock
represented by ADSs to be received in the Merger by holders of Seattle Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to Qualified
Seattle Common Stock represents the Threshold Percentage. If any such increase
is required, then the amount of Seattle Payment distributed pursuant to the
Separation and Distribution Agreement shall be decreased by an amount equal
to the product of $26.32 multiplied by the number of additional shares of
Miami Common Stock represented by ADSs required to be issued pursuant to the
Exchange Ratio adjustment set forth in the immediately preceding sentence;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall apply only if Houston acted
in a way that caused the failure to meet the Threshold Percentage in the
absence of the increase in ADSs issued pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. If the percentage of outstanding shares of Miami Common Stock
represented by ADSs to be received in the Merger by former holders of Seattle
Common Stock with respect to Qualified Seattle Common Stock (determined (i)
after giving effect to the issuance of all shares of Miami Common Stock
represented by ADSs and underlying shares of Miami Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and (ii) without regard to any adjustment
pursuant to this 

 



25 ##### Table of Contents

  

  _Section 3.1(c))_ would be increased as compared to such percentage
determined on the same basis on the date hereof solely because of a dividend,
distribution, share repurchase or similar transaction by Miami in accordance
with _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ of the Miami Disclosure Schedule, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted downward as if such dividend, distribution,
share repurchase or similar transaction had not occurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Exchange Ratio shall not be adjusted downward pursuant to
this sentence to the extent such adjustment would cause the number of shares
of Miami Common Stock represented by ADSs to be received in the Merger by
holders of Seattle Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Qualified Seattle Common Stock to represent less than 50.1% of all
shares of Miami Common Stock outstanding immediately following the
consummation of the Merger (determined after giving effect to (i) the
issuance of all shares of Miami Common Stock represented by ADSs and
underlying shares of Miami Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ and (ii) all adjustments pursuant to this _Section 3.1(c)_, but
without regard to this proviso).



     | 3.2. | Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration 
---|---|--- 

(a) Agent

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Miami will designate a U.S. bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Houston to act as agent of Miami for the purposes of
distributing the Merger Consideration (the "Agent"). At or substantially
concurrently with the Effective Time, Miami shall (i) allot and issue, or
cause to be allotted and issued, to the Depositary Bank, or any successor
depositary thereto, or a nominee for the Depositary Bank or successor
depositary thereto, a number of shares of Miami Common Stock equal to the
aggregate number of ADSs to be issued as Merger Consideration and (ii) deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Seattle Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Section
3_, through the Agent, the receipts (or uncertificated book-entries, as
applicable) representing such aggregate number of ADSs, and the Depositary
Bank shall be authorized to issue the ADSs representing such shares of Miami
Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement (such ADSs, whether evidenced
by receipts or book-entries, together with any dividends or distributions and
other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ and any cash
payable in lieu of any fractional ADSs in accordance with _Section 3.3_, in
each case to be held by the Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the Seattle Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Distribution
Fund"). Any cash in the Distribution Fund shall be invested by the Agent as
directed by Miami; _provided_ that (A) no such investment or loss thereon
will affect the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) in the
event that the Distribution Fund is for any reason insufficient to make the
payments contemplated by this Agreement, Miami will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Agent in
an amount equal to such deficiency. Except as contemplated by _Section
3.2(e)_, the Distribution Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
as specified in this Agreement. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Miami shall enter into an agreement with the Agent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Houston, to effect the applicable
terms of this Agreement (the "Agent Agreement").

entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to ADSs held

the account of Persons entitled thereto.

The shares of Miami Common Stock underlying the ADSs issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be properly and validly allotted and issued in accordance
with the UKs Companies Act 2006, as amended (the "Companies Act") and the
Organizational Documents of Miami, and credited as fully paid and ranking

notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the shares of Miami Common
Stock underlying the ADSs issued pursuant to the Merger (and such ADSs) shall

on or before April 30, 2017 that has a record date on or prior to the

underlying shares of Miami Common Stock with a record date after

Stock with respect to any ADSs that are not able to be distributed by the
Agent promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a legal impediment to
such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed ADSs, there shall be paid to the record holder of such ADSs,
without interest, (i) at the time of the distribution, to the extent not
previously paid, the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional ADSs to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date prior to the distribution of such ADSs payable with respect
to such whole ADSs or the underlying shares of Miami Common Stock, and (ii) at

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Seattle Common Stock

 

All ADSs issued in respect of shares of Seattle Common Stock (including any
cash paid in lieu of fractional ADSs pursuant to  _Section 3.3_) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Seattle Common Stock.

 

(e) Termination of Distribution Fund

 

Any portion of the Distribution Fund made available to the Agent that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Seattle Common Stock on the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Miami, and any former
holders of Seattle Common Stock who have not received ADSs in accordance with
this _Section 3_ shall thereafter look only to Miami for payment of their
claim for ADSs and any dividends, distributions or cash in lieu of fractional
ADSs with respect to Miami Common Stock (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law).

 

(f) No Liability

Neither Houston, the Surviving Corporation, Miami, Intermediate Holdco,
Merger Sub, the Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of
Seattle Common Stock or any holder of shares of Houston Common Stock for ADSs
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with respect to
Seattle Common Stock) or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of
the Distribution Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Seattle Common Stock
as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Miami free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to.

From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Seattle shall

withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

(i) No Appraisal Rights

 

In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of Seattle Common Stock in connection with the Merger.



     | 3.3. | Fractional Shares 
---|---|--- 

(a) No fractional ADSs shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof
each holder of Seattle Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional ADS
will be entitled to receive, from the Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section 3.3_, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional
ADS representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Agent (reduced by any fees of the Agent
attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of ADSs equal to the
excess of (i) the aggregate number of ADSs to be delivered to the Agent by
Miami pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole
ADSs to be distributed to the holders of shares of Seattle Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ (such excess, the "Excess ADSs"). Houston,
Seattle, Miami, Intermediate Holdco and Merger Sub acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional ADSs was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Miami that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional ADSs. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Agent, as agent for the holders of Seattle
Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional ADSs, shall sell the
Excess ADSs at then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

 

(b) The sale of the Excess ADSs by the Agent, as agent for the holders of
Seattle Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional ADSs, shall be
executed on the NYSE and shall be made at such times, in such manner and on
such terms as the Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion. Until
the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
Seattle Common Stock, the Agent shall hold such net proceeds in trust for the
holders of Seattle Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional ADSs
(the "Common Shares Trust"). The Agent shall determine the portion of the
Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Seattle Common Stock shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds
comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the amount of the fractional ADS interest to which such holder of Seattle
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the
aggregate amount of fractional ADS interests to which all holders of Seattle
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

 

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Seattle Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
ADS interests, the Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of
shares of Seattle Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance
with _Section 3.2_.

 



     | 3.4. | Houston Equity Awards and Miami Equity Awards 
---|---|--- 

Each Houston Equity Award held by a Seattle Employee as of the Effective Time
shall be treated as set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.

Parties and, to the knowledge of Miami and the Miami Parties, the other
parties thereto (subject, in each case, to the Remedies Exception). As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would (assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.1_ and _8.3_ and the completion of the Marketing Period),
(i) constitute a default or breach on the part of the Miami Parties, or
to Miamis knowledge any other party thereto, under any term or condition of
the Seattle Commitment Letter (ii) constitute or result in a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the Seattle Commitment Letter or
(iii) to Miamis knowledge, otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
being unavailable to Seattle on or before the Closing Date. The Seattle
Commitment Letter plus available cash will provide financing sufficient for
Seattle to finance the Seattle Payment and pay or reimburse all related fees
and expenses associated therewith (the "Financing Obligations"). Other than as
set forth in the Seattle Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Seattle
Commitment Letter and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.3_ and the completion of the Marketing Period, Miami
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the Financing
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be
available to Seattle immediately prior to the Distribution Date.

(c) Miami has delivered to Houston true, complete and fully executed copies of
an executed commitment letter (including: (A) all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments to such agreement in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; and (B) any associated fee letters (in unredacted form) (together,
as amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified from time

Lenders, collectively, the "Lenders"), pursuant to which, among other things,

Parties with debt financing in the amount set forth therein (the debt
financing contemplated by the Miami Commitment Letter, together with any
amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or waiver
thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement being referred to as
the "Miami Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, (x) the Miami
Commitment Letter has not been amended, waived or modified, and (y)
the respective commitments contained in the Miami Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.1_ and  _8.3_ and the completion of the Marketing Period, Miami has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the Miami Financing
could not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Miami Financing will not
be available to Miami to the extent Miami intends to obtain such financing.

     | 7.3. | Tax Matters 
---|---|--- 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the Parties hereby adopt it as such.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the Intended Tax
Treatment and shall not knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Intended Tax
Treatment. Following the Effective Time, none of Houston, Miami or any of
their Affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Intended Tax Treatment.

(b) Miami and Houston shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts in order for:

(i) Houston to obtain the opinion of Houston Tax Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Houston, dated as of the Closing Date, on
the basis of the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth
or referred to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, to the
effect that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (A) the
Contribution, taken together with the Distribution, should qualify as a
"reorganization" under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (B) the
Distribution should qualify as a transaction in

 



78 ##### Table of Contents

  

 which the Seattle Common Stock and Seattle Class B Common Stock received by
holders of Houston Common Stock and Common-Equivalent Houston Preferred Stock,
respectively, is "qualified property" for purposes of Section 361(c) of the
Code; (C) no income, gain or loss should be recognized by Houston or Seattle
upon the Contribution and the Distribution (other than intercompany items or
excess loss accounts taken into account pursuant to Treasury Regulations
promulgated pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code); (D) no income, gain or loss
should be recognized by the holders of Houston Common Stock and Common-
Equivalent Houston Preferred Stock upon the receipt of Seattle Common Stock
and Seattle Class B Common Stock, respectively, in the Distribution (except
with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Seattle
Common Stock or Seattle Class B Common Stock, if any); (E) the Subsidiary
Stock Recapitalization should qualify as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a)(1)(E) of the Code; and (F) the Merger should qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (such
opinion of Houston Tax Counsel, the "Houston Tax Opinion").

(ii) Miami, Houston and Seattle, and others, if required, shall, as of the
Closing Date, execute and deliver to Houston Tax Counsel the Tax
Representation Letters dated and executed as of the Closing Date. In addition,
Miami, Houston and Seattle, and others, if required, shall, as of the date
the Miami Registration Statement is declared effective, execute and deliver to
Houston Tax Counsel the Tax Representation Letters, dated and executed as of
such date.

 

(c) Houston shall direct Houston Tax Counsel to notify Houston promptly upon
becoming aware that it has any reason to believe it may not be able to
deliver the Houston Tax Opinion at the Closing Date. In the event Houston Tax
Counsel so advises Houston that it may not be able to deliver the Houston Tax
Opinion, Houston shall promptly notify Miami, and following such
notification, Houston shall keep Miami reasonably informed regarding its
efforts to obtain the Houston Tax Opinion.

(d) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.03_ of the Tax Matters Agreement, Houston
shall not file any request for a ruling with the IRS with respect to the
Intended Tax Treatment unless Houston has obtained Miamis prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
For the avoidance of doubt, Houston shall comply with the covenants described
in _Section 7.03_ of the Tax Matters Agreement in connection with filing any
such request.

 

(e) As of the date hereof, Houston is not aware of the existence of any fact,
or has taken or agreed to take any action, that would reasonably be expected
to cause any Seattle Common Stock to be exchanged in the Merger for Miami
Common Stock to not be Qualified Seattle Common Stock. Houston shall not take
any action that would reasonably be expected to cause, any Seattle Common
Stock to be exchanged in the Merger for Miami Common Stock to not be
Qualified Seattle Common Stock. Houston agrees to promptly notify Miami if,
before the Effective Time, it becomes aware of the existence of any fact that
would reasonably be expected to cause any Seattle Common Stock to be
exchanged for Miami Common Stock to not be Qualified Seattle Common Stock.

Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), together with notice of
such certificate to the IRS in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.897-2(h) (which notice shall be mailed to the IRS by Seattle following the
Closing in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)).

set forth herein, no failure to obtain any tax opinion, tax ruling or third-
party approval required under the Austin TMA shall affect Houstons or

the Reorganization) and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, shall not require
Houston to agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any
assets or businesses, or restriction or change in the ownership, conduct or
operations of any assets or businesses, that are not included in the Seattle
Business.



     | 7.7. | Financing 
---|---|--- 

(a) Miami shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange as promptly as reasonably practicable the Financing prior
to the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Seattle Commitment
Letter or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by _Section
7.7(b)_ (or, in the event any portion of or all of the Financing pursuant to
the Seattle Commitment Letter becomes unavailable, the Alternative Commitment
Letter). Miami shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to (i) comply with and maintain the Seattle Commitment Letter in
effect until the initial funding of the Financing and negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto, on the terms and conditions contained
therein or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by _Section
7.7(b)_ (the "Financing Agreements") and shall deliver to Houston a copy
thereof as promptly as practicable upon reasonable request (and no later than
one (1) Business Day after such request); (ii) comply with the obligations
that are set forth in the Seattle Commitment Letter that are applicable to
Miami or any Subsidiary of Miami 

 



85 ##### Table of Contents

  

 and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent in the Seattle
Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within its control;
and (iii) fully enforce the rights of the Miami Parties under the Seattle
Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements. In the event any funds in the
amounts set forth in the Seattle Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements, or any portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Seattle Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements, or it becomes reasonably likely that such funds may become
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth therein, Miami shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain promptly any such portion from the same or alternative sources, in an
amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
available, to allow Seattle to pay all of the Financing Obligations (the
"Alternative Financing") and to obtain, and, when obtained, to provide
promptly to Houston a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for
such financing (the "Alternative Commitment Letter") and negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein
(the "Alternative Financing Agreements"). In the event Alternative Financing
is obtained, any reference in this Agreement to "Financing" shall include
"Alternative Financing," any reference to "Seattle Commitment Letter" shall
include the "Alternative Commitment Letter," any reference to "Seattle
Lenders" shall include the financial institutions providing such Alternative
Financing, and any reference to "Alternative Financing Agreements" shall
include any definitive agreements with respect to the Alternative Commitment
Letter, and all obligations of each party pursuant to this _Section 7.7_
shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as such partys obligations, as
the case may be, with respect to the Financing.

 

(b) Miami shall give Houston prompt written notice upon it or any of its
Subsidiaries obtaining knowledge (w) of any material breach (or threatened
material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Seattle Commitment
Letter or the Financing Agreements; (x) of any actual or threatened
withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of the Seattle
Lenders; (y) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of
the parties to the Seattle Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements; and
(z) of any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Seattle
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Miami and Houston shall give
each other prompt written notice if for any reason it believes in good faith
that the Miami Parties or Seattle, as applicable, will not be able to timely
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Seattle Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements. Miami shall keep Houston informed in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, including by providing
copies of then-current drafts of the Financing Agreements and providing copies
of all definitive agreements, in each case, upon reasonable request. The
Miami Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of Houston, amend,
modify, supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any
waiver under the Seattle Commitment Letter in a manner that: (i) adds new or
expands upon the conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing as set
forth in the Seattle Commitment Letter, (ii) would reduce the aggregate amount
of Financing provided for under the Seattle Commitment Letter, (iii) would
limit the rights and remedies of the Miami Parties as against the Seattle
Lenders; or (iv) would otherwise prevent, impair or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
the Miami Parties may modify pricing and implement or

 



86 ##### Table of Contents

  

 exercise any of the "market flex" provisions exercised by the Seattle
Lenders in accordance with the Seattle Commitment Letter as of the date hereof
and (y) additional lenders and financing sources may be added (including in
replacement of a Seattle Lender) to the Seattle Commitment Letter (or all or a
portion of the commitments may be assigned to new or existing lenders and
financing sources) after the date hereof or thereof and the Miami Parties may
reallocate commitments or assign or re-assign titles and roles to or among
parties to the Seattle Commitment Letter. Miami shall, to the extent
reasonably required for the Miami business after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the financing contemplated by the Miami Commitment Letter and,
unless an alternative financing source is funded, or an amendment or a
commitment therefor with no more onerous conditionality than that contained
in the Miami Commitment Letter is obtained, use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the Miami Commitment Letter in full force and effect for the
aggregate amount of financing contemplated by the Miami Commitment Letter as
of the date hereof and with conditionality no more onerous than in effect as
of the date hereof.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Houston shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives (and use reasonable best efforts to cause external auditors)
to provide all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and
consummation of the Financing and the arrangement of the Miami Financing in
the bank financing market in each case, as may be reasonably requested by
Miami and that is customary in connection with efforts to obtain financing of
the type of the Financing and the Miami Financing, including (i) participation
in a reasonable number of lender meetings, rating agency presentations and due
diligence sessions at mutually agreeable times and upon reasonable
notice; (ii) furnishing to Miami and the Lenders, as applicable, pertinent
information regarding the Seattle Business as is customary in connection with
bank facilities such as the Financing and the Miami Financing and such other
financial information as may be reasonably requested by Miami in order to
consummate the Financing and the Miami Financing, including furnishing to
Miami information and assistance in connection with Miamis preparation of
projections and pro forma financial statements; (iii) assisting Miami and its
financing sources in the marketing and syndication of the Financing and the
Miami Financing and in the preparation of (A) a customary private and public
bank information memorandum for the Financing and the Miami Financing; and
(B) materials for rating agency presentations, lender presentations and bank
syndication materials and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing and the Miami Financing; (iv) taking customary corporate actions
reasonably requested by Miami that are necessary to authorize and permit the
consummation of the Financing; (v) providing customary authorization and
management representation letters representing that the information provided
by Houston and its Subsidiaries and Seattle and its Subsidies and their
respective Representatives for inclusion in any confidential information
memorandum or lender presentation does not include material non-public
information about Houston, Seattle and their respective Subsidiaries or
securities, and designating such information as suitable to be made available
to lenders who do not wish to receive material non-public information and
containing a customary 10b-5 representation (solely with respect to Seattle
and its subsidiaries); (vi) providing such customary assistance with the
preparation of any credit or loan agreements and other related definitive
financing documents as may be reasonably requested and facilitating in the
provision of guarantees and collateral of Seattle and its Subsidiaries, in
each case, related to the Financing and the Miami Financing; and (vii)
providing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
all documentation and other information about the Seattle Business required
by applicable "know

 your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the
USA PATRIOT Act to the extent reasonably requested at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the anticipated closing of the Financing or the Miami
Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.7(c)_,
no action contemplated in this _Section 7.7(c)_ shall be required if any such
action shall: (I) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business or
ongoing operations of Houston and its Subsidiaries; (II) cause any
representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement to be
breached; (III) involve the entry into any Financing Agreement or any other
binding commitment by Houston or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with
respect to the Financing, in the case of Seattle and its Subsidiaries, (x) the
Financing Agreements and, if applicable, Alternative Financing Agreements,
and related authorizations, certificates, instruments and documents
contemplated thereby, (y) documentation with respect to the Loan Escrow Demand
and the borrowing contemplated thereby and (z) customary representation and
authorization letters referred to in clause (v) of this _Section 7.7(c)_);
(IV) require Houston or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives to provide (or to have provided on its behalf) any
certificates or legal opinions (other than, in the case of Seattle and its
Subsidiaries, (x) certificates delivered at the closing of the Financing (or
pursuant to a Loan Escrow Demand) and on the Distribution Date and (y) upon
incurrence of the Financing, a customary opinion related to the non-
contravention of the Financing with the Houston Credit Agreement and any
indentures to which Houston is a party on such date); (V) cause any director,
officer or employee of Houston or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal liability; (VI) require Houston or any of its Subsidiaries to execute
and deliver any pledge or security documents or certificates, documents or
instruments relating to the provision of guarantees and collateral in
connection with the Financing or the Miami Financing other than those related
to Seattle and its Subsidiaries that shall not become effective until after
the Distribution and except in connection with a Loan Escrow Demand, or (VII)
without limiting clauses (III) and (VI) above, require Houston or its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver any documentation related to the Financing
or the Miami Financing other than documentation which only becomes effective
(i) in the case of the Financing, immediately prior to the funding of the
Financing and the Distribution, except in connection a Loan Escrow Demand and
(ii) in the case of the Miami Financing, after the Merger. Houston hereby
consents to the use of Seattles and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Financing and solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the reputation or goodwill of the relevant party,
or any of their respective intellectual property rights.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Financing is
available and all conditions to the Closing set forth in  _Section 8_ have
been satisfied or waived other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, Houston shall cause Seattle or a Subsidiary of
Seattle to, and Seattle or such Subsidiary shall, incur the indebtedness
provided for under the Seattle Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements
and use the proceeds thereof to make the Seattle Payment, including by
executing and delivering to the Seattle Lenders the Financing Agreements and
related certificates, instruments and documents contemplated thereby;
_provided_ that such obligations shall be subject to clauses (V), (VI) and
(VII) of Section 7.7(c) _mutatis mutandis_ and Houston shall not be required
to deliver any legal opinions (other than, upon incurrence of the financing,
a customary opinion related to the non-contravention of the Financing with the
Houston Credit Agreement and indentures to which Houston is a party on such
date). On or after April 4, 2017, if the Seattle Lenders under the Seattle
Commitment Letter require that the Financing be funded and placed in escrow
pursuant to the terms of the Seattle

 



88 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Commitment Letter (a "Loan Escrow Demand"), Seattle or such Subsidiary shall
take all actions necessary to satisfy such Loan Escrow Demand, including: (i)
pledging the proceeds of such financing to the administrative agent, for the
benefit of the lenders, thereunder, to secure the obligation to repay any
borrowing to the extent the Closing Conditions (defined below) are not

which pledge shall provide that such proceeds shall be released prior to and
in anticipation of the Distribution on terms reasonably satisfactory to
Houston and Miami, (ii) entering into customary escrow arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Houston and Miami, (iii) borrowing the full amount
of the Financing and placing such funds into escrow (such principal amount,
the "Loan Escrow Amount") and pre-funding in cash, in advance each quarter as
contemplated in the Seattle Commitment Letter, the amount of ticking fees and
interest that will accrue on such Loan Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Seattle Commitment Letter through the Outside Date (as defined
in the Seattle Commitment Letter) (such interest amount, the "Loan Interest
Escrow Amount"). Houston and Miami shall undertake good faith discussions to
consider permitting a trust company or similar entity to be the borrower of
such Loan Escrow Amount. Any such escrow arrangements shall provide that (x)
the Loan Escrow Amount (plus any unused Loan Interest Escrow Amounts) will be
released to Seattle upon the satisfaction of the conditions to the release
of proceeds of the Financing from escrow to fund the Distribution (the
"Closing Conditions") or (y) such borrowing shall be repaid at the issue price
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon in the event that the
Closing Conditions are not satisfied and this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to _Section 9_. Seattle will pay the fees required to paid by it
under the Seattle Commitment Letter.

 

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Seattle
Business obtained by Miami or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section
7.7_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth
herein or in any other agreement between Houston and Miami (or their
respective Affiliates), Houston agrees that Miami may share information with
respect to Seattle and its business with the Lenders, and that Miami and such
Lenders may share such information with potential financing sources in
connection with any marketing efforts for the Financing and the Miami
Financing; provided, however, that the recipients of such information and any
other information contemplated to be provided by Miami or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 7.7_, agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements, including "click through" confidentiality
agreements and confidentially provisions contained in customary bank books and
offering memoranda.

 

(f) Miami shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (if the Closing occurs, such
Subsidiaries shall be Seattle and its Subsidiaries) to, (i) promptly upon
request by Houston, reimburse Houston or its Subsidiaries for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
Houston or its Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided for in
_Section 7.7(c)_ and _(d)_ (such reimbursement to be made promptly and in
any event within three (3) Business Days of delivery of reasonably acceptable
documentation evidencing such expenses); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Miami
shall not be responsible for reimbursing any such costs and expenses if such
costs and expenses would have been incurred by Houston and its Subsidiaries in
the performance of their respective obligations pursuant to other provisions
of this Agreement (including _Sections 7.4_ and _7.17_ ) and the Separation
and Distribution Agreement and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless Houston, its
Subsidiaries and its

 and their Representatives from and against any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement or
consummation of the Financing, the Miami Financing, or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing, and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by Houston and its Subsidiaries) except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of (x) the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by
Houston or its Subsidiaries or (y) any default or waiver under the Houston
Credit Agreement and any indentures to which Houston is a party on such date.
For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 7.7(f)_ shall not apply to the
Pre-Funded Interest Amount (if any), which shall be governed by _Section
9.3_.

 

(g) Miami and Seattle shall reasonably cooperate with Houston in connection
with the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings required
in connection with the Exchange Offer, including by taking all such other
actions as are required of Houston pursuant to _Section 7.7(c)_, which shall,
together with _Section 7.7(e)_, apply _mutatis mutandis_ with respect to the
cooperation by Miami and Seattle in connection with the Exchange Offer by
Houston.



     | 7.8. | Access to Information 
---|---|--- 

(a) Houston shall, and shall cause the Seattle Entities, on the one hand, and
Miami shall, and shall cause the Miami Subsidiaries, on the other hand, afford
to the other Party and to its respective Representatives, reasonable access,
during normal business hours, during the Interim Period, in such manner as
to not interfere with Miamis and its Subsidiaries or the Seattle Entities
(as applicable) normal operation, the properties, books and records, Contracts
and appropriate senior-level officers and employees of Miami and the
Miami Subsidiaries or the Seattle Entities (as applicable), and shall furnish
such Party and its respective Representatives with financial and operating
data of Miami and the Miami Subsidiaries or the Seattle Entities (as
applicable) and other information concerning the affairs of Miami and the
Miami Subsidiaries or the Seattle Entities (as applicable), in each case, as
such Party and its Representatives may reasonably request solely for the
purposes of preparing the filings contemplated by  _Section 7.4_, preparing
for the operation of Miami and the Surviving Corporation post-Closing and
preparing the planned divestiture of any portion of the business of Miami and
the Surviving Corporation post-Closing; _provided_ , that (a) such
investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and at the sole cost and
expense of the investigating Party; (b) no Party or its Representatives shall
be permitted to perform any environmental sampling, including sampling
of soil, groundwater, surface water, building materials, or air or wastewater
emissions; and (c) that nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to

would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such Partys business or
result in damage to property (other than immaterial damage), except with such
other Partys written consent (which may be withheld or denied at its sole
discretion), (ii) would cause a violation of any Law or any confidentiality
obligations and similar restrictions that may be applicable to such
information or (iii) would cause a risk of a loss of attorney-client privilege
or other disclosure privilege to such Party ( _provided_ that the Party that
would otherwise be required to disclose information to the other shall take
any and all reasonable action necessary to permit such disclosure without such
loss of privilege or violation of agreement or Law, including "clean room" or
other similar procedures designed to limit any such adverse effect of the
sharing of such information by each Party). The Parties hereby agree that the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information
and material furnished by any Party or

 



90 ##### Table of Contents

  

 its Representatives thereunder and hereunder and that nothing in this
_Section 7.8_ shall require Houston to provide access to any of its
businesses or any information other than with respect to the Seattle
Business. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement. All requests for such access to any Party shall be made to such
Party or its designated Representative. Seattle will make available to Miami
prior to the Closing true and complete copies of the Organizational Documents
of the Seattle Subsidiaries.

(b) Houston shall (and shall cause the other Houston Entities and the Seattle
Entities to) deliver to Miami: (i) as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, but in any event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the
expected Closing Date (as reasonably and mutually determined by Houston and
Miami or, in the absence of a mutual determination, August 31, 2017) (such
date as applicable, the "Projected Closing Date"), for all Transferred
Registered IP, a list of the names, addresses, email addresses and phone
number of prosecution counsel and agents (to the extent known by Houston);
(ii) no later than ninety (90) days prior to the Projected Closing Date, a
list of all actions that must be taken for Transferred Registered IP within
ninety (90) days after the Distribution Date (including the payment of any
registration, maintenance, or renewal fees or the filing of any documents,
corrections, or replies to any Governmental Authority, applications or
certificates, for the purposes of prosecuting, maintaining, or renewing any
such registered, issued, or applied-for Transferred Registered IP, to the
extent known by Houston or set forth in Houstons docketing system at the
time it provides such information to Miami); and (iii) to the extent that
Houston becomes aware of any changes, or if any changes are made in Houstons
docketing system, to the information that Houston has provided to Miami
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, updates up to the Distribution Date
on a monthly basis.

(c) Subject to and as permitted by applicable Law, Houston shall (and shall
cause the other Houston Entities and the Seattle Entities to) cooperate and
assist Miami in good faith with respect to: (i) after the date hereof,
providing information to Miami that is reasonably sufficient to allow Miami
to understand prosecution, maintenance, renewal, and new filing activities
through the Distribution Date with respect to the Transferred Registered IP;
and (ii) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Projected Closing
Date, providing written instructions to all prosecution counsel and agents
throughout the world who are responsible for the Transferred Registered IP to
instruct such counsel and agents that Miami or a Seattle Entity (as directed
by Miami) will be responsible for the Transferred Registered IP as of the
Distribution Date, instructing such counsel and agents to continue to
prosecute and maintain the Transferred Registered IP in the ordinary course
through the Distribution Date and thereafter, instructing such counsel and
agents to take such actions as directed by Miami or a Seattle Entity (as
directed by Miami).



     | 7.9. | DandO Indemnification and Insurance 
---|---|--- 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Miami agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of
any Seattle Entity against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Houston or any of its Subsidiaries

 



91 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (including the Seattle Entities), as the case may be, would have been
permitted under the Organizational Documents of Seattle in effect on the date
hereof to indemnify such Person (including promptly advancing expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under such Organizational Documents).
Without limiting the foregoing, Miami shall cause the Seattle Entities (i) to
maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time
provisions in their respective Organizational Documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Seattle Entities respective former and current officers,
directors, employees and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons
than the provisions of the Organizational Documents of Houston or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Seattle Entities), as applicable, in each case,
as of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 

(b) Miami shall procure (i) a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year "tail"
policy commencing on the Closing Date containing terms not less favorable
than the terms of directors and officers liability insurance covering those
Persons who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance policies of Houston or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Seattle Entities) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) an endorsement under Miamis existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy to provide such coverage. If any
claim is asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, then any insurance
required to be maintained under this _Section 7.9_ shall be continued in
respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.9_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Miami and Seattle and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present and former director,
officer and employee of any Seattle Entity and his or her heirs and
representatives. In the event that Miami or Seattle or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Miami or Seattle, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_.



     | 7.10. | No Solicitation 
---|---|--- 

(a) Miami shall immediately cease, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations
with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal, or
any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal, and shall request to have returned promptly any confidential
information that has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations.
From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 9_, Miami shall
not, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information which has not been previously
publicly disseminated) any Competing Proposal or any proposal which would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, or (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any 

 



92 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Miami may ascertain
facts from the Person making an unsolicited Competing Proposal for the sole
purpose of the Miami Board informing itself about the terms of such Competing
Proposal and the Person that made it and (B) prior to obtaining the Miami
Shareholder Approval and following the receipt of a _bona fide_ written
Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that the Miami Board determines
in good faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisor and of its
outside legal counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited,
initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section 7.10_, Miami may, in
response to such Competing Proposal and subject to compliance with _Section
7.10(c)_, (x) furnish information with respect to Miami to the Person making
such Competing Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Competing Proposal; _provided_ , that Miami may only take the
actions described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) if it has provided
Houston and Seattle with notice of its intent to take such action at least one
(1) Business Day prior to taking the first of any such actions. Except as
expressly permitted by this _Section 7.10_, Miami shall not, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from and after the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9_, directly
or indirectly (1) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal; (2) take
any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal; (3) terminate, amend,
release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any
permission, waiver or request under, any standstill or similar agreement
entered into by the applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a
Competing Proposal (other than to the extent (I) the Miami Board determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take any of such actions under clause (3) would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the duties that the directors owe to Miami in their capacity
as directors of Miami under applicable Law and (II) Miami releases Houston of
any comparable standstill or similar obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement); or (4) propose to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_, prior to receipt of
the Miami Shareholder Approval, the Miami Board may (I) in response to any
_bona fide_ written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or indirectly,
solicited, initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section 7.10_,
effect a Miami Adverse Recommendation Change or (II) for any other reason,
effect a Miami Adverse Recommendation Change, in the case of each of clauses
(I) and (II), if and only if (i) (A) in the case of a Competing Proposal, the
Miami Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with Miamis outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) if for any other reason, if the Miami
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with Miamis outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the duties that
the directors owe to Miami in their capacity as directors of Miami under
applicable Law; (ii) the Miami Board provides Houston and Seattle four (4)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (an
"Alternative Notice"), which notice shall (if applicable) include the
information with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in
_Section 7.10(c)_ as well as a copy of such Competing Proposal, or the

 



93 ##### Table of Contents

  

 facts and circumstances relating to such other reason, as applicable (it
being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by Miami nor any public
announcement thereof that Miami determines it is required to make under
applicable Law shall constitute a Miami Adverse Recommendation Change unless
and until Miami shall have failed at or prior to the end of the Negotiation
Period (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such notice and such public
announcement shall constitute a Miami Adverse Recommendation Change) to
publicly announce that it (A) is recommending that Miamis shareholders vote
in favor of the resolutions required under the Miami Shareholder Approval
and (B) in the case of a Competing Proposal, has determined that such
Competing Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments
made to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by Houston
and Seattle in writing and (y) any modifications or adjustments made to such
other Competing Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected
such Competing Proposal); (iii) during the four (4) Business Days following
such written notice (the "Negotiation Period"), if requested by Houston or
Seattle and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Miami Board and its
Representatives have negotiated in good faith with Houston and Seattle
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Houston or Seattle in response to such Competing
Proposal or such other reason; and (iv) at the end of the Negotiation Period,
the Miami Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with Miamis
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement to which Houston and
Seattle have agreed in writing), that any Competing Proposal continues to be
a Superior Proposal (if applicable) and, after consultation with Miamis
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Miami Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to such Competing Proposal or other reason would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the duties that the directors
owe to Miami in their capacity as directors of Miami under applicable Law. Any
material amendment or modification to any Competing Proposal or to the facts
and circumstances relating to such other reason shall require a new
Alternative Notice and a new Negotiation Period commencing from the date of
receipt of such new Alternative Notice; _provided_ , that with respect to each
subsequent written notice related to a material amendment or modification,
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to two (2) Business Days. The Parties agree that if the UK Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers determines that _Section 7.10(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_
requires Miami to take or not to take action, whether as a direct obligation
or as a condition to any other Persons obligation (however expressed), that
is not permitted by Rule 21.2 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the
"Takeover Code"), that provision shall have no effect and shall be
disregarded.

 

(c) Without limiting the obligations set forth in _Section 7.10(a)_ and
_Section 7.10(b)_, Miami shall promptly, and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours, after it receives (i) any Competing Proposal or
written indication by any Person that it is considering making a Competing
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to Miami or
its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal
or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding
any Competing Proposal, notify Houston in writing of any of the foregoing
occurrences, the identity of the Person making such request, inquiry or
Competing Proposal and a copy of such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal
(or where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of
such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal), including any modifications
thereto. Miami shall keep Houston and Seattle reasonably informed

 on a current basis (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours
after the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations) of the status of any request, inquiry or Competing Proposal
(including the terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto),
and any material developments, discussions and negotiations (which shall
remain subject to the other obligations of Miami hereunder), including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, material correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Miami agrees that, subject to applicable restrictions
under applicable Law, it shall, prior to or substantially concurrent with the
time it is provided to any third parties, provide to Houston and Seattle any
non-public information concerning Miami or its Subsidiaries that Miami
provided to any third party in connection with any Competing Proposal which
was not previously provided to Houston and Seattle; _provided_ , that Miami
shall not be obligated to take any action contained in this _Section 7.10(c)_
to the extent such action would require Miami to make a public announcement
under the Takeover Code, the Market Abuse Regulation or the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules, it being acknowledged and agreed that if any such
disclosure would be so required, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to
permit Miami to comply with this _Section 7.10(c)_ without requiring such a
disclosure, including by seeking confirmation from the UK Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers or the UK Listing Authority (as appropriate) that Miami may
provide such notice(s) or such written materials, or keep Houston so informed
(as applicable), without being required to make a public announcement. Any
information provided to the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.10(c)_ above
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Miami or the Miami
Board from taking and disclosing to its shareholders its position with
respect to any (x) takeover offer for Miami or (y) other matter ( _provided_
that disclosure pursuant to clause (y) shall not limit any of Miamis
obligations hereunder) that Miami reasonably and in good faith determines
requires disclosure pursuant to the Listing Rules, and such disclosure shall
not be deemed a Miami Adverse Recommendation Change so long as such disclosure
(i) includes the Miami Recommendation, without alternation, modification or
qualification thereof, and (ii) does not otherwise effect a Miami Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(e) Any failure of Miamis Subsidiaries or their Representatives to comply
with this _Section 7.10_ (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were
directly subject to this _Section 7.10_) shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 7.10_ by Miami.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a third party relating to (A) a
merger, scheme of arrangement, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Miami; (B) the
acquisition (whether by merger, scheme of arrangement, consolidation, equity
investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%)
or more of the consolidated assets of Miami and the Miami Subsidiaries,
as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis; (C) the purchase or
acquisition after the date hereof, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by
any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Miami Common Stock or any other Interests in Miami; (D) any

 purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of
the shares of Miami Common Stock or any other Interests of Miami or any of
its Subsidiaries; or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ written Competing Proposal
(except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") made by a
third party which was not solicited by Miami or any of its Representatives in
violation of _Section 7.10(a)_ and which, in the good faith judgment of the
Miami Board after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the Competing Proposal, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated on a timely basis and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to Miamis shareholders from a financial
point of view, than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and after giving effect to all adjustments or modifications to the
terms thereof which may be agreed in writing to be made by Houston and Seattle
(including pursuant to _Section 7.10(b)_ ).

with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filings prior to
making such filings), and (b) each Party may make announcements from time to
time to their respective employees, customers, owners, suppliers and other
business relations and otherwise as such Party may reasonably determine is
necessary to comply with the requirements of any agreement to which such Party
is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate to
prepare press releases to be issued on or promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) after the date hereof and press releases to be issued
on the Closing Date.



     | 7.12. | Defense of Litigation 
---|---|--- 

Miami shall keep Houston apprised in the defense of any Action brought by

directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

the Effective Time, Miami shall not compromise, settle, come to an
arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding any Action arising or resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or consent to the same, without the prior written consent
of Houston (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
extent (a) such Action includes Houston or any of its Subsidiaries, directors
or officers as named defendants or (b) such compromise, settlement or
arrangement would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on

     | 9.3. | Expenses; Termination Payment 
---|---|--- 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement
or this Agreement, including this _Section 9.3_, and except for (i) the
expenses in connection with printing and mailing the Miami Registration

and the disclosure documents required in connection with the actions specified
in _Section 7.4_, (ii) all SEC filing fees relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) the fees in connection with the
approvals required under _Section 7.6(a)_ related to the Merger (each of

108 ##### Table of Contents

  

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_;
or (B) pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ without a vote of the shareholders of
Miami contemplated by this Agreement at the Miami Shareholders Meeting having
occurred, and (x) in any such case a Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Miami Board at any time
after the date of this Agreement and not publicly withdrawn at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of termination and (y) if within twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, a transaction in respect of a
Competing Proposal is consummated or Miami enters into a definitive agreement
in respect of a Competing Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same
Competing Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to the
termination hereof), then Miami shall be obligated to pay the Termination
Payment on the second Business Day following the earlier of the date Miami

(c) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement under
circumstances in which the Termination Payment is payable pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_, it is agreed that the Termination Payment is liquidated
damages, and not a penalty. Each Party agrees that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Miami fails to pay any amounts due
under this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Houston
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Miami for such amounts,
Miami shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts
was due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate
published in the Wall Street Journal for the relevant period, together with
the costs and expenses of Houston (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In the event that the Termination
Payment is payable and actually paid to and not irrevocably rejected by
Houston in accordance with this _Section 9.3_, payment of such Termination
Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Houston and its Affiliates
against Miami or Miami, its Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates and the
former, current and future shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and other Representatives of each such Person, any Lender and
Lender Related Party for any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof
or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that payment
by Miami of the Termination Payment shall not (i) limit the right of Houston
and its Subsidiaries and Representatives to be reimbursed for expenses and
indemnified in accordance with _Section 7.7(f)_ or recover interest in
accordance with the third sentence of this  _Section 9.3(c)_, or (ii)
relieve Miami from any liability or damage resulting from a Willful Breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 9.3_, shall in any way limit the
provisions of _Section 10.9_.

to pay more than one Termination Payment.

which shall be reasonably documented) for the period up to and including the
Closing Date in respect of the Financing, if any.

 

(iii) "Financing Expense Reimbursement" means (i) if Houston does not consent
in writing on or before October 31, 2016 to the completion of the Financing

future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees, equityholders,
Lenders or Lender Related Parties, financing sources, managers, members,

       | 10.8. | Severability 
---|---|--- 

If any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or
the application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid
or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the Parties.



     | 10.9. | Specific Performance 
---|---|--- 

In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, the Party who is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the
right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in
respect of its rights under this Agreement or such Transaction Document.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereto agree
that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the other Parties
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the obligations with
respect to the Financing), if the conditions set forth in _Section 8_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where permissible under applicable Law).
The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened
breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss
and that any defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties.
