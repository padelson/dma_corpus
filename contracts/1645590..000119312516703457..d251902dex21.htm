order to obtain such payment, Houston commences a suit that results in a judgment against Miami for such amounts, Miami shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal
to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the relevant period, together with the costs and expenses of Houston (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In the event that the Termination Payment is
payable and actually paid to and not irrevocably rejected by Houston in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U>, payment of such Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Houston and its Affiliates against Miami or Miami,
its Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates and the former, current and future shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and other Representatives of each such Person, any Lender and Lender Related Party for any loss or damage based

<U>Section&nbsp;9.3(c)</U>, or (ii)&nbsp;relieve Miami from any liability or damage resulting from a Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, including this <U>Section&nbsp;9.3</U>, shall in any way limit the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;10.9</U>. </P>
