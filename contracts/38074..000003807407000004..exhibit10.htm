AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

  This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is
made and entered into as of December 13, 2006 by and among
Forest Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Acquiror_ "),
FL Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation which is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "), Cerexa, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Target_ "), and Dennis Podlesak and Eckard Weber, as
Stockholders' Agent (solely for purposes of Section 5.12, Section 5.13 and
Section 8). Acquiror, Merger Sub and Target may be referred to herein
individually as a " _Party_ ", and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to
such term in  _Exhibit A_ of this Agreement, or if applicable as provided
in the text of this Agreement.

  

RECITALS

  

  A. The Boards of Directors of Target, Acquiror and
Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of their respective companies
and the stockholders of their respective companies for Target and Merger Sub
to combine into a single company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub
with and into Target (the " _Merger_ ") and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved this Agreement and the Merger.

  

  B. In connection with the Merger, the outstanding shares
of Target's capital stock will be converted into the right to receive the
cash amount described in this Agreement.

  

  C. Acquiror, Target and the Stockholders' Agent will
enter into an Escrow Agreement to be executed and delivered in accordance
with Section 5.5 (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  

  D. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations and warranties and enter into certain covenants in
connection with the Merger.

  

  E. As an inducement to the Acquiror to enter into this
Agreement, certain holders of Target Capital Stock (the " _Majority Holders_
") having voting power equal to or greater than the Required Stockholder
Vote have indicated their intention to deliver, as promptly as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, their irrevocable approval of the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to a
written consent, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_
(the " _Written Consent_ "), signed and dated by the Majority Holders in
their capacity as Target stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the execution of this Agreement, pursuant to and in strict accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Delaware Law, the Target certificate of
incorporation and the Target bylaws.

  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants,
representations and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

  

 1.   _The Merger_.

  

  

  1.1 _ The Merger_. At the Effective Time and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, in
the Certificate of Merger filed pursuant to Section 1.2 and in
the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
_Delaware Law_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

  

  

  1.2 _ Closing; Effective Time_. The
consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as
practicable, but no later than two Business Days, after the satisfaction or
waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in Section 6 to be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing), or at such other time as the Parties agree
(the actual date on which the Closing takes place being the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward Kronish
LLP, 3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California 94304, or at such other
location as the Parties agree. In connection with the Closing, Target shall
cause the Merger to be made effective by filing the Certificate of Merger in
substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1.2 with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of Delaware Law (the time of such filing or such later time as agreed to by
the Parties and provided in the Certificate of Merger being the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  

  

  1.3 _ Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger filed pursuant to Section 1.2 and the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law.

  

  

  1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.
At the Effective Time:

  

  (a) the certificate of
incorporation of Target shall be amended to read as set forth in _Exhibit C_
, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law
and such certificate of incorporation; and

  

  (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

  

  

  1.5 _ Directors and Officers_. At the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, to serve until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

  

  1.6 _ Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to
Sections 1.7(a), 8.1 and 8.3(a), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub,
Target, the Stockholders' Agent or the holders of any of the
securities identified below:

  

  

  (a) each share of Target Common
Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenting
Shares and shares owned by Target, Acquiror, Merger Sub or any of their
respective wholly owned subsidiaries) shall be converted into the right to
receive (without interest) (i) an amount of cash equal to (A) the
Merger Consideration _divided by_ the sum of (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time _plus_ (2) the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock
subject to unexercised Target Options (whether vested or unvested) that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the amount determined
pursuant to this subclause (A) being the " _Per Share Price_ "); _minus_
(B) the Escrow Contribution Amount per share of Target Capital Stock; 
_plus_ (C) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund
with respect to such share to the Former Holder thereof in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are
required to be made; _plus_ (ii) if the Milestone Event occurs, an amount of
cash equal to the Additional Merger Consideration _divided by_ the sum of (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (2) the aggregate number
of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to unexercised Target Options
(whether vested or unvested) that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time;

  

  (b) each share of Target Capital
Stock that is owned by Target as treasury stock, or by Acquiror or Merger Sub
or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefore; and

  

  (c) each share of common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  The amount of cash, if any, that each Former Holder of Target
is entitled to receive for the shares of Target Capital Stock held by such
Former Holder and/or Target Options held by such Former Holder (as provided
in Section 1.11) shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being
rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for
all shares of each class and series of Target Capital Stock held by such
Former Holder and all Target Options held by such Former Holder,

  

  

  1.7 Cancellation and Surrender of
Certificates.

  

  

  (a) _ No Further Rights as
Target Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no holder of record of
a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall have
any rights as a stockholder of Target.

  

  (b) _ Exchange Procedures_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Acquiror, together with a
letter of transmittal in form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (which letter
of transmittal shall include an undertaking of the signatory thereto not
to violate Section 1.13 hereof) providing that risk of loss shall pass only
upon delivery of such certificates to Acquiror, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (i) the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the share of the Merger Consideration which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a), and (ii) the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Acquiror shall: (x) as promptly
as practicable after receipt of each properly surrendered Certificate, but
in no event later than five Business Days after such receipt, cause the
payment described in the preceding sentence (not including any amounts
covered by Section 1.6(a)(i)(C) or Section 1.6(a)(ii)) to be made to the
holder of such Certificate by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by such holder in the letter of transmittal delivered
with such Certificate, and (y) if the Milestone Event occurs, as promptly
as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than forty-five days after
such occurrence, cause the payment described in Section 1.6(a)(ii) to be made
to the holder of such Certificate by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by such holder in the letter of transmittal
delivered with such Certificate (or such other account as designated in
writing by such holder). Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate
that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Target Capital Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the amount equal to
the share of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a). If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 1.7.

  

  (c) _ Transfers of Ownership_.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the records of Target.

  

  (d) _ No Liability_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, neither
Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be
liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Former Holders two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date which is immediately prior to such
time as the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws, the property of the Acquiror, free and clear of any claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

  1.8 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Acquiror shall pay to the record holder of such Certificate
the consideration into which the shares of Target Capital Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.6,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by such record holder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require such record
holder to deliver a bond in such sum as Acquiror may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

  

  

  1.9 _ Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of
such share (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") would be entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6, but rather shall be entitled to receive such amount as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to
Delaware Law. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such
stockholder's dissenters' rights under Delaware Law or effectively withdraws
or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be converted into the right
to receive the consideration referred to in Section 1.6, pursuant to
the exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.7. Target shall give Acquiror
(a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any shares
of Target Capital Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for
payment and any other instrument served pursuant to Delaware Law and received
by Target relating to any stockholder's dissenters' rights, and (b)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands for payment under Delaware Law.

  

  1.10 _ Taking of Further Action_. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger
Sub, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in their
respective names to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or
desirable action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

  

  1.11 _ Target Options_. As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Target (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the 2005
Equity Incentive Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all
outstanding Target Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to
provide that Target Options will become fully exercisable and may
be exercised before the Effective Time at such applicable time or times as
specified in the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, and at the Effective Time, each
Target Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, shall be canceled and the holder thereof
shall then become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of
such holder with respect thereto, an amount equal to: (a) an amount of cash
equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Target Common
Stock subject to such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_multiplied by_ (B) the amount by which the Per Share Price exceeds the
exercise price per share of Target Common Stock that is subject to such
Target Option; _minus_ (ii) the Escrow Contribution Amount for such Target
Option; _plus_ (iii) any cash disbursements required to be made from the
Escrow Fund with respect to such Target Option to the Former Optionholder
thereof in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, as and when
such disbursements are required to be made; _plus_ (b) if the Milestone
Event occurs, an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Target Common Stock subject to such Target Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time,  _multiplied by_ (ii) an amount equal to (A) the
Additional Merger Consideration _divided by_ (B) the sum of (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (2) the aggregate
number of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to unexercised Target
Options (whether vested or unvested) that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall cause the payment described in subsections (a)(i), as reduced
by subsection (a)(ii), of the preceding sentence to be made to the holder of
such Target Option by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by such holder in writing, and such holder shall remain
entitled to receive any additional cash disbursements as provided in
subclause (a)(iii) and subclause (b) (if applicable). If the Milestone Event
occurs, Acquiror shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter, but in no
event later than forty-five days after such occurrence, cause the payment
described in Section 1.11(b) to be made to the holder of such Target
Option by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by such holder in writing.

  

  1.12 _ Withholding Rights_. Acquiror shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 1 such withholding, employment and
similar taxes and all other amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign law. If the Acquiror so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Target Capital Stock or Target Options in
respect of whom the Acquiror made such deduction and withholding.

  

  1.13 _ Non-Transferability of Contingent
Rights_. No Former Holder shall directly or indirectly sell, assign, gift,
pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise voluntarily or involuntarily or
by operation of law encumber, transfer or dispose of (other than pursuant to
the laws of descent and distribution or by will) (each a " _Transfer_ ") any
of its rights to receive consideration under Section 1.6(a)(ii) or 1.11(b),
and neither the Surviving Corporation nor Acquiror shall be obligated to
effect or recognize a Transfer prohibited by this Section 1.13. The right to
receive consideration under Section 1.6(a)(ii) or 1.11(b) shall
not constitute an equity interest in Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
and shall not vest in or otherwise provide any Former Holder with any voting
rights or other rights of ownership of any security.

  

  

  2.   _Representations and Warranties of Target_. Target
represents and warrants to Acquiror as of the date of this Agreement (for
all purposes except for purposes of Section 8), and as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date (for purposes of Section 8) that the
statements contained in this Section 2 are true and correct except as
disclosed in a disclosure schedule of even date herewith delivered by Target
to Acquiror and complying with the provisions of Section 9.2 (the " _Target
Disclosure Schedule_ "):

  

  

  2.1 _ Organization, Standing and Power_. Each
of Target and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing, if applicable, under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation. There is no pending or, to the knowledge
of Target, threatened action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Target and its Subsidiaries have the
corporate power to own their properties and to carry on their business as now
being conducted (collectively, the " _Current Target Business_ "). Each of
Target and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business, and is in
good standing (if such concept is applicable in the relevant jurisdiction),
in each jurisdiction where the operation of the Current Target Business by
Target and its Subsidiaries requires such qualification. Target has
delivered, or made available for review in a data room, to Acquiror or its
advisors true and correct copies of the respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, as
applicable, of Target and each of its Subsidiaries, each as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. The minute books of Target and its Subsidiaries
have been made available in a data room for review by Acquiror or its
advisors and contain a materially complete and accurate summary of all
meetings of directors and stockholders or actions by written consent since
the time of incorporation of each such company through the date of this
Agreement. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents. Target has no Subsidiaries other than
those listed in Section 0 of Target Disclosure Schedule, and neither Target
nor any such Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for,
any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture or other business association or entity.

  

  

  2.2 _ Authority_. Target has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of (i) a majority
of the shares of Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class) outstanding on the record date chosen for
purposes of determining the stockholders of Target entitled to vote on the
adoption of this Agreement, (ii) a majority of the shares of Target Preferred
Stock (voting together as a single class) outstanding on the record date
chosen for purposes of determining the stockholders of Target entitled to
vote on the adoption of this Agreement and (iii) at least 60% of the shares
of Target Series B Preferred Stock outstanding on the record date chosen for
purposes of determining the stockholders of Target entitled to vote on the
adoption of this Agreement are the only votes of the holders of any Target
Capital Stock necessary under Delaware Law and the Certificate of
Incorporation of Target to approve this Agreement and the Merger (the "
_Required Stockholder Vote_ "). The Board of Directors of Target has
unanimously (a) adopted this Agreement and declared it advisable
and approved its execution and delivery and the consummation of the Merger;
(b) determined that the Merger is in the best interests of the stockholders
of Target, and (c) recommended that the holders of Target Capital Stock
approve this Agreement and the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Target
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Target, enforceable against Target in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Target does not constitute, and the
consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
result in, a termination, or breach or violation by Target of, or a default
by Target under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), (a) any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Target, as
amended, (b) any Material Contract or (c) any judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Target or any of
its properties or assets. No material consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required
to be obtained or made by Target at or prior to the Effective Time in order
for Target to execute and deliver this Agreement or consummate the Merger,
except for: (a) the filing of Certificate of Merger as provided in Section 0
and (b) such filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (" _HSR_ "), and foreign
antitrust laws. The holders of Target Capital Stock are not entitled to
appraisal, dissenter's or similar rights under any Applicable Laws except as
provided in Section 262 of the Delaware Law ("Section 262").

  

  

  2.3 _ Governmental Authorizations_. Target
and its Subsidiaries have obtained each material federal, state, county,
local or foreign governmental consent, license, permit, grant or other
authorization of a Governmental Entity that is required, as of the date
hereof, for the operation by Target and its Subsidiaries of the
Current Target Business, and all of such consents, licenses, permits, grants
and authorizations are in full force and effect.

  

  

  2.4 _ Financial Statements_. Target has
delivered to Acquiror or its advisors (a) the audited consolidated balance
sheets and statements of operations of Target and its Subsidiaries as of and
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and (b)(i) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Target and its Subsidiaries as
of September 30, 2006 (the " _Target Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii)
the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of Target and
its Subsidiaries for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2006 (collectively, the " _Target Financial Statements_ "). The Target
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as
disclosed in the notes thereto and except that the unaudited Target Financial
Statements do not contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered.
The Target Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects
and in accordance with GAAP, the financial condition of Target as of the
dates indicated therein and the operating results of Target for the periods
indicated therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of footnotes in the case of the unaudited Target Financial
Statements.

  

  

  2.5 _ Capitalization; Shares and Stockholder
Information_.

  

  (a) _ Capitalization_. The
authorized capital stock of Target consists of (i) 84,000,000 shares of
Target Common Stock, of which there were issued and outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement, 9,750,249 shares, and (ii) 64,000,000 shares of
Target Preferred Stock, of which as of the date of this Agreement 20,000,000
were designated Series A Preferred Stock and 44,000,000 were designated
Series B Preferred Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, there were issued
and outstanding: 20,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock convertible
into the same number of shares of Common Stock, and 42,176,299 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock convertible into the same number of shares
of Common Stock. Each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Target Common
Stock. All outstanding shares of Target Common Stock and Target Preferred
Stock (i) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable,
(ii) are free of any liens or encumbrances created by Target, and, to the
knowledge of Target, free of any liens or encumbrances created by or
imposed upon the holders thereof and (iii) were not issued in violation of
any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal created by statute, the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Target or any agreement to which
Target is a party or by which it is bound. As of the date of this Agreement,
there were 14,584,563 shares of Target Common Stock reserved for issuance
under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, of which 4,672,674 shares of Target
Common Stock were subject to outstanding options and 161,640 shares
of Target Common Stock were reserved for future option grants. Target has
delivered to Acquiror or its advisors (or made available in a data room) true
and complete copies of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and each form of
agreement evidencing each Target Option (and each such agreement accurately
reflects the actual date of grant of such Target Option determined in
accordance with GAAP). Except for the rights created pursuant to this
Agreement and the options and other rights disclosed in the preceding
sentences, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements that are outstanding to which Target is a party or by which it is
bound, obligating Target to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem,
or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares
of Target Capital Stock or other equity securities of Target or its
Subsidiaries or obligating Target to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting
of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any option,
warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement regarding shares of Target
Capital Stock or other equity securities of Target or its Subsidiaries. All
shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding
shares of Target Preferred Stock or upon exercise of the options described
in this Section 0 will be, when issued pursuant to the respective terms of
such Target Preferred Stock or options, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are no other contracts, commitments or
agreements relating to the voting, purchase or sale of Target's capital stock
(a) between or among Target and any of its stockholders; and (b) to Target's
knowledge, between or among any of Target's stockholders.

  

  (b) The authorized capital stock
of each of the Subsidiaries and the issued and outstanding shares of such
capital stock as of the date of this Agreement are reflected on Section
2.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule. All such outstanding shares (i) are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, (ii) are
free of any liens or encumbrances created by the Subsidiary and free of any
liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon Target and (iii) were not
issued in violation of any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal
created by statute, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any
Subsidiary or any agreement to which Target or any Subsidiary is a party or
by which it is bound.

  

  (c) _ Shares and Stockholder
Information_. Section 2.5(c) of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as
of the date hereof: (i) the number of shares of Target Capital Stock that
each current stockholder of Target holds of record; and (ii) to the knowledge
of Target, the address and state of residence of such stockholder.

  

  

  2.6 _ Absence of Certain Changes_. Between
September 30, 2006 (the " _Target Balance Sheet Date_ ") and the date of this
Agreement, Target and its Subsidiaries have conducted their business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and there has
not occurred (a) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any material asset of
Target or its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business; (b)
any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of Target or its Subsidiaries; (c) any material
increase in, or material modification of, the compensation or benefits
payable by Target or its Subsidiaries to any of their respective directors
or executive officers; (d) any declaration, setting aside or payment of a
dividend or other distribution with respect to shares of Target Capital
Stock; or (e) any incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money. Between the
Target Balance Sheet Date and the date of this Agreement, there has not been
any event or occurrence that has had, individually or in the aggregate, a

to Target or its Subsidiaries.

Acquiror a list, attached as Schedule 2.17(a) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, containing (a) the names of all current employees (including part-

current consultants of Target and its Subsidiaries, and (b) their current
respective salaries or wages, other compensation, dates of
employment, positions and all written agreements between Target and
such individuals or entities.

  

  (b) Section 2.17(b) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of each plan,
program, policy, contract, or agreement providing for employment,
compensation, retirement, deferred compensation, loans, severance,
separation, relocation, repatriation, expatriation, visas, work permits,
termination pay, performance awards, bonus, incentive, stock option, stock
purchase, stock bonus, phantom stock, stock appreciation right,
supplemental retirement, fringe benefits, cafeteria benefits or other
benefits, whether written or unwritten, including each "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), which is, or has been,
sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by
Target or its Subsidiaries and, with respect to any such plans which are
subject to Code Section 401(a), any trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) that is or at any relevant time was treated as a single
employer with Target within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), for the benefit of any person who
performs or who has performed services for Target or its Subsidiaries and
with respect to which Target, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has,
or is reasonably likely to have, any liability or obligation (collectively,
the " _Target Employee Plans_ ").

  

  (c) Target has delivered to
Acquiror or its advisors (or made available in a data room for review by
Acquiror or its advisors) true and complete copies of each of the Target
Employee Plans and related plan documents, including trust documents, group
annuity contracts, plan amendments, insurance policies or contracts,
participant agreements, employee booklets, administrative service
agreements, summary plan descriptions, compliance and nondiscrimination
tests for the last three plan years, standard COBRA forms and
related notices, registration statements and prospectuses and, to the extent
still in its possession, any material employee communications relating
thereto. With respect to each Target Employee Plan that is subject to ERISA
reporting requirements, Target has made available in a data room for review
by Acquiror or its advisors copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for
the last five plan years. Target has made available in a data room
for review by Acquiror or its advisors the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued with respect to
each such Target Employee Plan, and to Target's knowledge, nothing has
occurred since the issuance of each such letter that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee
Plan subject to Code Section 401(a).

  

  (d) Each Target Employee Plan is
being administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code). Target and each ERISA Affiliate are not in
default under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or
violation by any other party to, any of the Target Employee Plans. Any
Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable
determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all
currently effective amendments to the Code, or has time remaining to apply
under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service
pronouncements for a determination or opinion letter or to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or opinion letter.
None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person. Target has not engaged in, or
participated in, any transaction which would be considered a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, and to Target's knowledge, no other third-party
fiduciary and/or party-in-interest has engaged in any such "prohibited
transaction" with respect to any Target Employee Plan. Neither Target nor
any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections
4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any Target
Employee Plan. All contributions required to be made by Target or any ERISA
Affiliate to any Target Employee Plan have been paid or accrued. With respect
to each Target Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30)
day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043
of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or
4041 or ERISA occurred. Each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA has
prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental
reports, which were true and correct in all material respects as of the
date filed, and has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all
notices and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted
with respect to each such Target Employee Plan. No suit, administrative
proceeding or action is pending, or to the knowledge of Target is overtly
threatened in a written communication with Target, against or with respect to
any such Target Employment Plan. There has been no amendment to, or
written interpretation or announcement by Target or any ERISA
Affiliate regarding, any Target Employee Plan that would increase the
expense of maintaining such Target Employee Plan above the level of
expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005.

  

  (e) Neither Target nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to, or is obligated to contribute to, or otherwise incurred any
obligation or liability (including any contingent liability) under, any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any
"pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has
any actual or potential withdrawal liability (including any contingent
liability) for any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections
4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any multiemployer plan.

  

  

  (f) Neither Target nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to any self-insured plan that is governed by ERISA and that
provides benefits to employees (including any such plan pursuant to which a
stop-loss policy or contract applies), other than a health care reimbursement
plan.

  

  

  (g) With respect to each Target
Employee Plan, Target is in compliance with (i) the applicable health care
continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget

the applicable requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and
the regulations thereunder; and (iii) the applicable requirements of the

unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or benefits under any
Target Employee Plan), except as expressly provided in this Agreement;
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits or
increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or service
provider. No benefit payable or that may become payable by Target pursuant to
any Target Employee Plan or as a result of or arising under this Agreement
shall constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G) subject to the imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the
Code or the deduction for which would be disallowed by reason of Section 280G
of the Code. Each Target Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms,
without liability to Acquiror or Target other than ordinary administration
expenses typically incurred in a termination event.

  

  (i) Neither Target nor its
Subsidiaries are a party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement,
including but not limited to the provisions of this Agreement, covering any
employee or former employee of Target or its Subsidiaries that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to give rise to the payment
of any amount that would be subject to the deductibility limits of Section
404 of the Code.

all respects with the terms of such policies and bonds. Target has no
knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material premium increase with
respect to, any of such policies or bonds.

  

  

  2.19 _ Compliance With Laws_. Target and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with, and have not
received any written or oral notices of any material pending violation

except for violations that have been cured or are no longer being asserted.

  

  

  2.20 _ Brokers ' and Finders' Fee_. Except for
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (" _Credit Suisse_ "), no broker, finder

transaction contemplated hereby.

registration and listing requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. Section 360 and
21 CFR Part 207 and all similar Applicable Laws.

  

  (d) Target has not received any
notice that the FDA or any other Governmental Entity has initiated, or
threatened to initiate, any action to suspend any clinical trial, suspend or
terminate any Investigational New Drug Application sponsored by Target
or otherwise restrict the preclinical research on or clinical study of any
Target Product or any biological or drug product being developed by Target,
or to recall, suspend or otherwise restrict the manufacture of any Target
Product, and Target has no knowledge of any facts that have led it to believe
that any Governmental Entity is considering such action or is likely to take
such action.

  

  (e) Neither Target nor, to the
knowledge of Target, any of its officers, key employees, agents or clinical
investigators acting for Target, has committed any act, made any statement or
failed to make any statement that would reasonably be expected to provide a

pending with respect to a violation by Target of the FDCA, FDA regulations
adopted thereunder, the Controlled Substance Act or any other similar

Target has no knowledge of any facts that have led it to believe that any
such proceeding is likely to be brought.

  

  2.22 _ Clinical Material_. Target has access
on commercially reasonable terms to sufficient quantities of all clinical
trial materials, and/or all materials that Target believes are necessary
to manufacture clinical trial materials, in quantities sufficient to perform
Phase 3 clinical trials of ceftaroline and to carry out all associated
chemistry, manufacturing, and controls activities, including but not limited

and stability testing, as applicable to the stage of development of the
product..

it was incorporated. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror or
Merger Sub, threatened, action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency
of either Acquiror or Merger Sub. Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub is duly
qualified to do business, and is in good standing (if such concept is

such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

have all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery by
Acquiror and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Acquiror

necessary corporate action on the part of Acquiror and Merger Sub, and
no other authorization or consent of Acquiror, Merger Sub or
their respective stockholders is necessary other than the approval of this
Agreement by Acquiror in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Acquiror and Merger Sub,
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Target, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of
Acquiror and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Acquiror and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.

  

  

  3.3 _ Noncontravention_. Neither the
execution and delivery by Acquiror and Merger Sub of this Agreement, nor the
consummation by Acquiror or Merger Sub of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will:

provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Acquiror or the

by Acquiror of such reports and information with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
any registration, declaration, filing, permit, order, authorization, consent
or approval which if not made or obtained would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Acquiror's or Merger Sub's ability to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
(an " _Acquiror Material Adverse Effect_ ");

  

  (c) conflict with, result in a
breach of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under, result in the acceleration of obligations under, create in any
party any right to terminate or modify, or require any notice, consent or
waiver under, any contract or agreement to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a
party or by which Acquiror or Merger Sub is bound, except for (i) any
conflict, breach, default, acceleration or right to terminate or modify that
would not reasonably be expected to result in an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) any notice, consent or waiver, the failure of which to make or
obtain would not reasonably be expected to result in an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect;

  

  (d) violate any order, writ,
injunction or decree applicable to Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets, except for any violation that would

  

not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect;

  

  (e) violate any statute, rule or
regulation applicable to Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective

or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, overtly threatened in a communication with
Acquiror, against Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or any of their respective officers or directors
(in their capacities as such) that would reasonably be expected to result in
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (b) There is no judgment, decree
or order against Acquiror or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Acquiror and
Merger Sub, against any of their respective directors or officers (in their
capacities as such) that specifically names Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or

an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

  (b) Within seven (7) days of the

any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B) keep the

other foreign, federal or state antitrust, anticompetition or fair trade law.
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Applicable Laws, in connection with any legal proceeding under or relating to
HSR or any other foreign, federal or state antitrust, anticompetition or fair
trade law or any other similar legal proceeding relating to the Merger to
which either Target or Acquiror is a party, each of Target and Acquiror will
permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each

  (a) Acquiror shall enroll all
Target Employees that remain employed by the Surviving Corporation ("

employment, compensation, retirement, deferred compensation, loans,
severance, separation, termination pay, performance awards, bonus,
incentive, stock option, stock purchase, stock bonus, phantom stock,
stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, fringe
benefits, cafeteria benefits or other benefits, whether written or
unwritten, including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA (the " _Acquiror Employee Plans_ "), to the extent
applicable, which are provided to similarly situated employees of Acquiror
based on levels of responsibility and shall (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Acquiror or its affiliates to
be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents,
(ii) to the extent permissible under Acquiror's health and welfare plans,
give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits
for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment
has been made, and (iii) give such Continuing Employees service credit for
their employment with Target for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not
for benefit accrual) under any such applicable Acquiror Employee Plan, as
if such service had been performed with Acquiror. Until the effective date
of the enrollment of the Continuing Employees in a particular Acquiror
Employee Plan, Acquiror shall continue in effect without amendment or
reduction in benefits the existing Target Employee Plan covering the same or
similar benefits as would be covered by such Acquiror Employee Plan. Nothing
in this Section 5.6 is intended to prevent Acquiror from terminating any of
its benefit plans in a manner that does not affect the vested or other pre-
existing rights of any Continuing Employee.

  

  (b) Effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Target and any ERISA Affiliate, shall
have terminated any and all Target Employee Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each a " _Target 401(k) Plan_ " and
collectively, the " _Target 401(k) Plans_ ") (unless Acquiror shall
have provided written notice to Target that such Target 401(k) Plans shall
not be terminated). Unless Acquiror provides such written notice to Target,
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Target shall
have provided Acquiror with evidence that such Target 401(k) Plans have been
terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of Target. In the event
that termination of a Target 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then Target
shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of
such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquiror no
later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

  5.7 _ FIRPTA Matters_. At the Closing, Target
shall deliver to Acquiror: (a) a statement conforming to the requirements

  (a) From and after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Target
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Target and the equivalent
organization documents of its Subsidiaries as each is in effect on the date
of this Agreement (the persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such
provisions, and all other current and former directors and officers of Target
and its Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ").

  

  (b) During the period ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Acquiror will, to the
maximum extent provided by law (but subject to any limitations that are
applicable to Target and its Subsidiaries under Applicable Laws and the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Target and
the equivalent organizational documents of its Subsidiaries with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liability as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against
and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises
out of or pertains to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer or
employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Indemnified Matters"); 
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Acquiror
a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section
5.8(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (i) Acquiror will have the right to control the defense
thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to
control the defense thereof, Acquiror will be deemed to have waived any right
to object to the Indemnified Parties' entitlement to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) any counsel retained by the
Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense thereof for any period
after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror,
and (iii) after the Effective Time, Acquiror will pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received
(provided that in the event of a final non-appealable judicial determination
that any Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, any
amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving
Corporation);  _provided_ , ___however_ , that neither Acquiror nor the
Surviving Corporation, nor any Indemnified Party, will be liable for any
settlement effected without its, his or her express written consent. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to
local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless
counsel for any Indemnified Party determines in good faith that, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict exists or is
reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the positions of any
two or more Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.8(b) or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Acquiror shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be
sought under this Section 5.8 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from
all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

  

  (c) Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay all expenses, including
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified Parties in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.8.

  

  (d) Through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause to be maintained in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage for all Indemnified Matters which
is substantially equivalent to that provided under Target's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  __ _however_ , that in no event shall Acquiror be
required pursuant to this Section 5.8(d) to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 125% of the annual premium currently payable by
Target with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the
annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Acquiror shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount. . In lieu of such annual coverage,
Acquiror may or may cause Target to purchase at the Effective Time a 6 year
tail insurance policy complying with the coverage requirements set forth in
the preceding sentence.

  

  (e) This Section 5.8 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time, is intended to
benefit and may be enforced by the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation.

respective directors or officers, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents or representatives (each,
a " _Representative_ ") (and Target shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause its employees not), directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or

person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal (it being
understood that if any executive officer or director of Target shall become
aware that any of Target's Representatives is violating this Section 5.9,
Target shall instruct such person, and otherwise use reasonable efforts to
cause such person, to cease such violation).

purchase (including in the case of Target IP Rights any material license or
similar agreement other than one that is in the ordinary course (and in
furtherance) of Target's business) in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets (including Target IP Rights) or businesses
that constitute 15% or more (on either a book value or fair market basis) of
the revenues, net income or the assets of Target and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Target, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Target,
or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving Target or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any

fair market basis) of the revenues, net income or the assets of Target and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of clause (a) of this Section 5.9 or anything else in this
Agreement, prior to receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote and in response
to any bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of
Target determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal did
not result from a breach of this Section 5.9 by Target, Target may, if its
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that failure to do so is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Target under Applicable Laws, (x)
furnish information with respect to Target and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Takeover Proposal and such person's representatives pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement, provided that all such information
has previously been provided to Acquiror or is provided to Acquiror prior to
or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person and

Takeover Proposal (and such person's representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

the assets of Target and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case
which the Board of Directors of Target determines in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to
be (x) more favorable to the stockholders of Target from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

  

  (d) Except as permitted by this
Section 5.9(d), prior to the receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote,

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt
or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) allow, cause or authorize Target or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement providing for or contemplating the consummation of
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as provided in
Section 5.9(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote, the Board of
Directors of Target may take the actions set forth in clause (i)(A) above if
such Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to do so would constitute a breach by the Board
of Directors of Target of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Target
under Applicable Laws.

  

  (e) Target shall, promptly (and
in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt of any Takeover Proposal or
indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal, indication of interest or any request for nonpublic
information relating thereto (which Takeover Proposal, indication of interest
or request is received after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement), advise Acquiror orally and in writing of such Takeover
Proposal, indication of interest or request (including the identity of
the person making or submitting such Takeover Proposal, indication
of interest or request, and the material terms thereof). Target shall keep
Acquiror reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such Takeover
Proposal, indication of interest or request received and any modification or
proposed modification thereto.

  

  5.10 _ Notification of Certain Matters._

  

  (a) Target shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Acquiror of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event before the Closing which occurrence or failure
causes (i) any representation or warranty of Target contained in this
Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect or (ii) Target to be unable to comply with or satisfy
by the Closing any material covenant, obligation, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement any exhibit or
schedule hereto; _provided, however_ , that such disclosure shall not be
deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation, or agreement or to satisfy any condition. Target shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Acquiror of any
event or state of facts before the Closing that has or is reasonably likely
to have a Target Material Adverse Effect. Any such notification by the
Target shall not be deemed to amend the schedules hereto for purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in Article 6 hereof have
been satisfied and shall not be deemed to cure any breach of any
representation or warranty or to limit the rights and remedies of the parties
under this Agreement for any breach by the other parties of such
representations and warranties.

  

  (b) Acquiror shall give prompt
notice to the Target of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event
before the Closing which occurrence or failure causes Acquiror to be unable
to comply with or satisfy by the Closing any material covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or
any exhibit or schedule hereto; _provided, however_ , that such disclosure
shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or to satisfy any condition.

  

  (c) Not earlier than 10 and not
less than 2 days before the date scheduled for Closing, Target shall correct
and supplement in writing any information furnished on Schedules provided by
Target that are incorrect or incomplete, and shall promptly furnish such
corrected and supplemented information to Acquiror, so that all
provided information shall be correct and complete at the time such
updated information is so provided. Thereafter, prior to the Closing,
the Target shall correct and supplement in writing any information furnished
on its Schedules that is incorrect or incomplete. It is agreed that no such
correction or supplement shall be deemed to create any presumption that such
information constitutes or evidences the existence of a material change to,
or a breach or violation by Target of, any provision of this Agreement.
Any corrected and supplemental information shall not be deemed to amend the
Schedules for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Article 6 hereto have been satisfied and shall not be deemed to cure any
breach of any representation or warranty or to limit the rights and remedies
of Acquiror and Merger Sub under this Agreement for any breach by the Target
such representations and warranties.

  

  5.11 _ Payment of Transaction Expenses_.
Without limiting any obligation of the Surviving Corporation, Acquiror shall
ensure that all Transaction Expenses and Severance Obligations not paid
prior to the Closing shall be paid at or immediately after the Closing (it
being understood that Acquiror and Target hereby acknowledge and agree that:
(a) as a result of, and upon consummation of, the Merger (and without any
other event occurring or circumstance existing), a "Constructive Termination"
shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to the change in control provisions
in the offer letters from Target provided to those Target employees with
offer letters as identified in Section 2.5(a) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule; and (b) the payments that become due to such employees
as a result of the deemed "Constructive Termination" referred to in this
sentence shall be deemed to be "Severance Obligations" for purposes of this
Agreement, including this Section 5.11), provided that the payment obligation
of Acquiror, as to a particular employee, with respect thereto may be
conditioned upon receipt by Acquiror of the release contemplated by such
employee's offer letter and an acknowledgement by such employee that such
offer letter is no longer in force, except with respect to the obligation in
the Dennis Podlesak offer letter with respect to payment of amounts described
in subclause (x) below. If the Milestone Event occurs, Acquiror shall pay, or
shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay: (x) Dennis Podlesak the amount, net
of applicable withholding taxes, owed based on the occurrence of such
Milestone Event pursuant to the terms of Mr. Podlesak's offer letter
with Target; and (y) as promptly as practicable thereafter, but in no event
later than forty-five days thereafter, Credit Suisse the amount, if any, due
to Credit Suisse as set forth in the CFO Certificate.

  

  5.12 _ Diligence and Reporting Regarding
Ceftaroline Products_. At all times prior to the occurrence of the Milestone
Event, Acquiror shall comply with, and shall ensure that the Surviving
Corporation shall comply with, all obligations under the Takeda
Agreement regarding the development, seeking regulatory approval of
and commercialization of products containing Ceftaroline. Further, after
first approval of an NDA in the United States covering a product containing
Ceftaroline, Acquiror shall, and shall insure that Surviving Corporation and
any applicable other affiliates of Acquiror shall, promote all such products
in the United States and take orders, make sales and fill orders for products
containing Ceftaroline in the United States on a commercially reasonable
basis consistent with Acquiror's (or its affiliates', as applicable)
policies and practices with respect to its other products of similar market
opportunity in the United States. Acquiror shall provide Stockholders' Agent
(after regulatory approval of any product containing Ceftaroline in the
United States) with a written report every year that lists in
reasonable detail all the promotion, marketing and sales efforts
undertaken and/or conducted by or on behalf of Acquiror or
Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors in interest) during
the prior twelve months in the United States, the results of such
sales efforts including a complete and accurate report of the actual Product
Net Sales resulting in the United States in such twelve months period. The
Former Holders are intended third party beneficiaries of the provisions of
this Section 5.13, and the Stockholders' Agent may enforce the Former
Holders' interests under this Section in case of breach hereof by
Acquiror (and such enforcement by Stockholder's Agent shall be the sole
remedy for enforcing such Former Holders' interests).

  

  5.13 _ Audit Rights_. Upon the written request
of the Stockholders' Agent and not more than once in each calendar year,
Acquiror shall permit the Stockholders' Agent and/or an independent certified
public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by the
Stockholders' Agent, at the expense of the Stockholders' Agent (except as
otherwise provided below), to have access during normal business hours to
all of the records of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation (and
any affiliate or successor of interest of either as is applicable),
for inspection, copying and analysis, as may be reasonably necessary
to verify (a) the accuracy of the reports of Product Net Sales provided as
required in Section 5.13 for any year or years ending not more than five
years prior to the date of such request, and (b) the performance by Acquiror
of its other obligations in Section 5.13. Such access and inspection shall be
pursuant to reasonable and customary confidentiality agreements entered into
between the inspecting party and the inspected party. If such accounting
firm identifies a discrepancy in the amount of Product Net Sales made during
the period audited, and such discrepancy indicates that the Milestone Event
occurred at a time earlier than such reports would indicate, then (if not
paid previously) the amounts of the Additional Merger Consideration owed to
Former Holders under the terms of this Agreement based on such Milestone
Event occurring shall be paid by Acquiror promptly after such payment
obligation is identified, and if such discrepancy shows the Additional
Merger Consideration should have been paid 90 or more days earlier than
it was actually paid, then in addition all fees of such accounting firm in
conducting such inspection shall be paid by Acquiror.

  

  5.14 _ Right to Pursue [***] ****Opportunity
if Acquiror Declines_. Acquiror agrees that if Acquiror does not consent to
Target entering into, prior to the Closing, the License Agreement with [***]
(the "[***] Agreement") that is contemplated by the [***] Letter of Intent
(as such term is defined in Target Disclosure Schedule), and if Acquiror does
not subsequent to the Closing enter into the [***] Agreement, then at the
request of Stockholders' Agent, Acquiror will, and will cause
Surviving Corporation to, discuss reasonably with Stockholder's Agent (or
appropriate institutional investors who are Former Holders) the reasonable
terms under which certain interested Former Holders could pursue the business
opportunity reflected in the [***] Letter of Intent by entering into a
similar license agreement directly with [***]. Target acknowledges that it is
important to Acquiror to obtain information promptly regarding the [***]
Letter of Intent, the proposed [***] Agreement, and the technical information
in Target's possession regarding the [***] opportunity covered by the [***]
Agreement, and as such Target shall request from [***] as soon as practicable
the right to disclose such information to Acquiror, pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement between Acquiror and [***], and shall use
reasonable efforts to pursue obtaining the right to make such disclosure.
Target shall also request [***].

  8.2 _ Indemnification_.

  

  

  (a) _ Expiration of
Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. All representations and
warranties made by Target in this Agreement or, if applicable, in the Target
Closing Certificate, shall expire on the date 365 days after the Closing Date
(the " _Representation Termination Date_ "); _provided_ _,_   _however_ _,_
that if at any time prior to the Representation Termination Date, Acquiror
delivers to the Stockholders' Agent a notice stating the existence of
an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Target or
in the Target Closing Certificate or the CFO Certificate or a breach of a
covenant made by Target (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
Acquiror's determination that such an inaccuracy or breach exists and the
amount of the Damages incurred by Acquiror as a result of such inaccuracy or
breach) and asserting a claim for recovery under this Section 8.2 based on
such inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice
shall survive the Representation Termination Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. All obligations of the
parties under the covenants contained herein (including the covenants
set forth in Sections 4 and 5) shall expire at the Effective Time, except to
the extent that any such covenant expressly specifies that it is to be (or is
otherwise required by this Agreement to be) performed after the Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding the expiration of
the parties' obligations under such covenants, claims for breaches of any
covenants of Target prior to their expiration may be brought after the
Effective Time and until the Representation Termination Date.

  

  

  (b) _ Indemnification_. Subject
to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(c) and the other
limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
the Acquiror shall be indemnified and held harmless solely out of each
Former Holder's Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund against any Damages
actually incurred by Acquiror as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Target set forth in Section 2 (without giving
effect to any materiality or Target Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualification therein) or in the Target Closing Certificate or the CFO
Certificate and (ii) the breach of any covenant of Target in this Agreement
required to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of
this Section 8, " _Damages_ " shall mean any liabilities, losses, damages,
penalties, fines, costs or expenses, including reasonable legal, expert and
consultant fees and expenses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of
computing the amount of any Damages incurred by Acquiror: there shall be
deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received or receivable by Acquiror or any of its affiliates in
connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the
total amount in respect of which any Former Holder shall be liable
to Acquiror under this Agreement shall not exceed such Former Holder's Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.

  

  (c) _ Limitations of Liability_.

  

  (i) Subject to
Section 8.2(c)(iii), the right of Acquiror to be indemnified from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to this Section 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Target
contained in, or any breach by Target of, this Agreement, or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
Section 8.2(c)(iii), no current or former stockholder,
optionholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of Target
shall have any personal or individual liability of any nature to Acquiror,
the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in, or any breach of, this Agreement or the Target Closing
Certificate, or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that (A) no current or former
stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of Target
has made or is making any representations, warranties or
commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied, (B) except as expressly provided in Section 2,
Target has not made and is not making any representations, warranties
or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied, and (C) except as expressly provided in Section 2,
Acquiror is not relying and has not relied on any representations, warranties
or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied.

  

  (ii) Without limiting
the effect of any other limitation contained in this Section 8, the
indemnification provided for in this Section 8.2 shall not apply, and
Acquiror shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification rights under
this Agreement: (A) with respect to any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of Target set forth in Section 2 or the breach of any covenant by
Target if the Damages relating to such inaccuracy or breach do not
exceed $50,000; or (B) except to the extent that the aggregate amount
of Damages relating to matters other than any claim for indemnification
based on any inaccuracy in the CFO Certificate and against which Acquiror
would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under this Section 8.2 exceeds
$1,500,000. If the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds $1,500,000, then
Acquiror shall, subject to the other limitations contained herein,
be entitled to be indemnified from the Escrow Fund only against the portion
of such Damages in excess of $1,500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
claim for indemnification based on any inaccuracy in the CFO Certificate
shall be subject to such $50,000 or $1,500,000 exclusion, and Acquiror shall
be entitled to indemnity therefor on a "first dollar" basis.

  

  (iii) Nothing in this
Section 8.2(c) shall limit any remedy Acquiror may have against any person
for fraud under applicable tort laws or with respect to the breach by such
person of any contractual obligations (excluding obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement) to which such person is subject, including
but not limited to any obligations not to compete with Target, not
to disclose Target's confidential information, or to assign to Target
certain intellectual property rights.

  

  (d) _ Defense of Third-Party
Claims_. Promptly after Acquiror obtains knowledge of any actual or possible
claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or
proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third party
against Acquiror or any of Acquiror's Subsidiaries or other affiliates and
that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_
"), Acquiror shall promptly give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the
Stockholders' Agent, stating the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim
and the dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known.
The Stockholders' Agent shall have the right at its election, at any time,
to defend any Third-Party Claim if the sole remedy sought thereby is for
money damages in an amount which is not more than 25% of the amount which is
then remaining in the Escrow Fund and available to pay such damages (a
"Qualifying Claim"). Any such election shall constitute an irrevocable
acknowledgement by the Stockholders' Agent and to conclusively establish that
the Aquiror and the Merger Sub are entitled to be indemnified hereunder in
respect of such Third Party Claim, and if such election is exercised, : (i)
Stockholders' Agent shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third-
Party Claim; (ii) the attorneys' fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror (approval of such counsel not to be unreasonably withheld),
other professionals' and experts' fees and court or arbitration costs
incurred by the Stockholders' Agent in connection with defending such Third-
Party Claim shall be payable from the Escrow Fund with the approval of the
Acquiror which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; (iii) Acquiror
shall be entitled to monitor such defense at its expense; (iv) Acquiror shall
make available to the Stockholders' Agent all books, records and other
documents and materials that are under the direct or indirect control
of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates and that the
Stockholders' Agent considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; (v) Acquiror shall execute such documents and take such
other actions as the Stockholders' Agent may reasonably request for the
purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise
or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vi) Acquiror shall
otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by the Stockholders' Agent
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vii) Acquiror shall not admit any
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (viii) the
Stockholders' Agent shall not enter into any settlement agreement providing
for the settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) if such settlement agreement imposes on Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates any obligation, other than an
obligation to pay monetary damages in an amount less than the aggregate cash
amount remaining in the Escrow Fund and available to pay such damages.
Acquiror shall diligently defend (i) any Qualifying Claim which the
Stockholder's Agent elects not to defend as provided herein , and any other
Third-Party Claim but (ii) Acquiror shall have no right to seek
indemnification under this Section 8 in respect of any settlement of any
such Claim entered into without the prior written consent of
the Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iii) Stockholder's Agent shall be entitled to monitor such defense at
its expense (any such expense to be paid out of the Escrow Fund subject to
the Acquiror's approval which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  

  

  8.3 _ Stockholders ' Agent_.

  

  

  (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with respect to each share of Target Capital
Stock held by the Non-Dissenting Former Stockholders immediately prior to
the Effective Time, an amount equal to the Stockholders' Agent Expense
Contribution Amount, and with respect to each Target Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to the Stockholders'
Agent Expense Contribution Amount times the number of shares of Target
Capital Stock that are subject to such Target Option, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in an account designated by the Stockholders'
Agent to be used for payment of any Stockholders' Agent Expenses (the "
_Stockholders ' Agent Expense Account_"). The amount that is deposited by
Acquiror into the Stockholders' Agent Expense Account pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a) with respect to each share of Target Capital Stock and each
Target Option shall reduce the amount that, but for the provisions of this
Section 8.4, the holder of such share of Target Capital Stock would
have otherwise been entitled to receive at the Effective Time in respect of
such share of Target Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof and the
holder of such Target Option would have otherwise been entitled to receive at
the Effective Time in respect of such Target Option pursuant to Section 1.11
hereof.

  

  (b) The Stockholders' Agent may,
from time to time, withdraw amounts from the Stockholders' Agent Expense
Account for the payment of Stockholders' Agent Expenses. Upon termination of
the Escrow Agreement, if there shall be any amount on deposit in
the Stockholders' Agent Expense Account, the Stockholders' Agent shall cause
such amount to be distributed to the Former Holders ratably based on their
Pro Rata Portion thereof.

  

  (c) By virtue of the adoption of
this Agreement by Target's stockholders, and without further action of any
Target stockholder or option holder, each Former Holder shall be deemed to
have irrevocably constituted and appointed Dennis Podlesak and Eckard Weber
(and by execution of this Agreement each of them hereby accepts such
appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact (" _Stockholders ' Agent_") for
and on behalf of the Former Holders, with full power of substitution, to act
in the name, place and stead of each Former Holder with respect to
this Section 8 and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Stockholders'
Agent of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or
permitted to be taken by the Stockholders' Agent under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to: (i) give and
receive notices and communications under this Section 8 or the Escrow
Agreement; (ii) authorize delivery to Acquiror of cash from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of claims for indemnification made by Acquiror under this
Section 8; (iii) object to claims for indemnification made by Acquiror under
this Section 8; (iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to claims
for indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 8; and (v) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the
Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The power of
attorney granted in this Section 8.3 is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable, may be delegated by the Stockholders' Agent and shall
survive the death or incapacity of any Former Holder. The identity of
the Stockholders' Agent and the terms of the agency may be changed, and a
successor Stockholders' Agent may be appointed, from time to time (including
in the event of the death, disability or other incapacity of the
Stockholders' Agent) by Former Holders whose aggregate Pro Rata Portions
exceed 50%, and any such successor shall succeed the Stockholders' Agent
as Stockholders' Agent hereunder. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders' Agent, and the Stockholders' Agent shall receive no
compensation for his services.

  

  (d) The Stockholders' Agent shall
not be liable to any Former Holder for any liability, loss, damage, suffered
by such Former Stockholder while acting in good faith and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder
(it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith).

  

  (e) From and after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
Stockholders' Agent with access to information about the Surviving
Corporation and the assistance of the officers and employees of Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation, in each case to the extent reasonably necessary
to enable the Stockholder's Agent to perform his duties and exercise his
rights under this Agreement, provided that the Stockholders' Agent shall
treat confidentially any nonpublic information he receives from Acquiror
regarding the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  (f) The Stockholders' Agent shall
be entitled to no compensation for his service in such capacity.

  

  8.4 _ Actions of the Stockholders ' Agent_.
From and after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Former Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each Former Stockholder, and the Escrow Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each Former Stockholder. Acquiror
and Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by Stockholders' Agent and any acts done
by Acquiror or Surviving Corporation in accordance with any such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent. For all purposes of
this Agreement involving Stockholders' Agent, any document executed or
purported to be executed by either Dennis Podlesak or Eckard Weber (or by
both of Dennis Podlesak and Eckard Weber) in their capacity as Stockholders'
Agent shall constitute a document executed by, and action authorized by, the
Stockholders' Agent.

warranties in Section 2 of this Agreement, or as applicable to the relevant

  9.4 _ Entire Agreement; Nonassignability;
Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits hereto, Target Disclosure
Schedule and the other schedules hereto: (a) together constitute the entire

  9.5 _ Severability_. In the event that any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof becomes, or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances other than those as to which
it is determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, will not be impaired
or otherwise affected and will continue in full force and effect and be
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  

  

  9.6 _ Remedies Cumulative_. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of,
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

  

  

  9.7 _ Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to parties residing in the State of Delaware, without
regard to applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any federal court sitting in Delaware in connection with any
action or proceeding based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that is instituted by any other party or
third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and agrees that process in any
such action or proceeding may be served upon it in any manner authorized by
the laws of the State of Delaware and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and
such process. Each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by
jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

  9.8 _ Rules of Construction_.

  

  (a) The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in

such agreement or document.

Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include

neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include the masculine and
feminine genders.

  

  (c) As used in this Agreement,
(i) the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be
deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation" and (ii) the words "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and "hereto" shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific section of this Agreement.

  

  (d) Except as otherwise
indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Schedules" and
"Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement.

  

  

  9.9 _ Time is of the Essence; Enforcement_.
Time is of the essence of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

  9.10 _ Amendment; Waiver_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto;
provided, however, that after the Required Stockholder Vote has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further
approval of the stockholders of Target without such approval having
been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any waiver of any of
the terms or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly
executed by or on behalf of the party to be charged with such waiver. Except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the failure of a party to exercise
any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict adherence to any term
or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be construed as a waiver
or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later date. Further, no
waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition hereof
(whether or not similar).
