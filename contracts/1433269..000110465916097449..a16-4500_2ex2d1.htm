 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS**

 



 

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
the Merger Subs or the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Shares and Preferred Shares_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Common Stock of the Company, par value US$0.001 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, a
" _Common Share_ " and together with the Preferred Shares, the " _Shares_ "),
other than (A) any Common Shares beneficially owned by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, (B) any Cancelled Shares (as defined
herein) and (C) any Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), shall be converted
into the right to receive US$4.90 in cash, without interest (subject to
adjustment as contemplated by the last sentence of _Section 7.2(a)_, the "
_Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of such Common Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.3_; and

 



 

(ii) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, other than (A) any Preferred Shares beneficially
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, (B)
any Cancelled Shares and (C) any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of (x) US$0.15, _plus_
(y) all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, thereon, whether or not
declared, as of the Closing Date, _plus_ (z) the Common Stock Merger
Consideration (such sum, the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ " and,
collectively with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) _Parent, Merger Subs and Company-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Merger Subs immediately prior to the
First Effective Time, if any, or that is held in treasury by the Company
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub I Capital Stock_. At the First Effective Time,
by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub I or any other Person, each share of common stock, par value
US$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub I that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged as a
whole for a number of shares of common stock, par value US$0.001 per share, of
the First Step Surviving Corporation (the " _First Step Surviving Corporation
Common Shares_ ") equal to the number of Common Shares (including all issued
and outstanding Preferred Shares on an as-converted basis) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time,

 



      
 

 



 

and the First Step Surviving Corporation Common Shares shall be the only
shares of the First Step Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately after the First Effective Time. From and after the
First Effective Time, each certificate representing a number of shares of
Merger Sub I common stock will evidence the number of shares of common stock
of the First Step Surviving Corporation into which such shares shall have been
so converted, until the same are surrendered for cancellation and exchange.

 



 

(d) _Conversion of First Step Surviving Corporation Capital Stock_. At the
Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub II or any other Person, (i) each share of
capital stock of the First Step Surviving Corporation that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be provided therefor;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Common Shares
outstanding at the Second Effective Time as a result of the exercise of
Options under the 2007 Plan or the 2010 Plan as contemplated pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)_ shall receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, and
(ii) each share of capital stock of Merger Sub II issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as an
identical share of capital stock of the Second Step Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and are held by a Person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and
validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the applicable
Merger Consideration, and the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_
, that if such Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in
any case pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be
converted as of the First Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes and
without interest thereon, for each such Share in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. At the First Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written
demands or withdrawals of such demands for appraisal of Shares received by the
Company and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. For purposes of this
_Section 2.1(e)_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Shares (to the extent
that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be afforded any
decision-making power or other authority over such demands except as set forth
in the succeeding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, between the date of
this Agreement and the First Effective Time, the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to
settle or settle any such demands without Parents prior written consent.

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Awards under the 2007 Plan and 2010 Plan_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall, within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof,
provide notice of the Merger to each holder of outstanding and unexercised
options to purchase Common Shares (each, an " _Option_ ") granted under the
Diligent Board Member Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
" _2007 Plan_ ") or the Diligent Board Member Services, Inc. 2010 Stock Option
and Incentive Plan (the " _2010 Plan_ "), informing such holder that during
the period beginning with the date the holder receives the notice and ending
at the Second Effective Time, such holder shall have the right to exercise all
or any part of the unexercised portion of such Options (without regard to
employment requirements or any installment exercise limitations). Each such
Option, to the extent unexercised, shall be cancelled as of the Second
Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) The Company, the Board and the Compensation Committee of the
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to (A) effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.2(a)(i)_, (B)
provide that each of the 2007 Plan and the 2010 Plan will terminate as of the
Second Effective Time and (C) ensure that following the Second Effective Time
no participant in the 2007 Plan or the 2010 Plan will have any right
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of Parent, the Company, the First
Step Surviving Corporation, the Second Step Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) _Awards under the 2013 Plan_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall provide that each Option granted under the Diligent
Board Member Services, Inc. 2013 Incentive Plan (the " _2013 Plan_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised at the First Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be canceled as of the First Effective Time, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash equal to the product of
(A) the number of Common Shares previously subject to such Option and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Common Share previously subject to such Option (the " _Strike Price_
"), without interest and less any required withholding Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Option granted under the 2013 Plan that has an
exercise price that equals or exceeds the Common Stock Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled in accordance with this _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ for no
consideration. The Second Step Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause an
Affiliate to pay, either directly or through payroll, the holders of Options
the cash payments described in this _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ on or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and, in any event, no later
than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two (2)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) The Company shall provide that each Common Share granted pursuant to the
2013 Plan subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions (collectively, "
_Restricted Shares_ ") that is outstanding at the First Effective Time shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled as of the First Effective Time, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in respect of the cancellation
of such Restricted Shares equal to the product of (x) the number of such
Restricted Shares and (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any required withholding Taxes. The Second Step Surviving
Corporation shall pay, or cause an Affiliate to pay, either directly or
through payroll, the holders of Restricted Shares the cash payments described
in this _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing Date, and, in any event, no later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date that is at least two (2) Business Days after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall provide that each restricted stock unit
granted under the 2013 Plan (each, a " _RSU_ ") that is outstanding at the
First Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the First Effective Time
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in
respect of the cancellation of such RSU equal to the product of (x) the number
of Shares subject to such RSU immediately prior to the First Effective Time
and (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest and less any
required withholding Taxes. The Second Step Surviving Corporation shall pay,
or cause an Affiliate to pay, either directly or through payroll, the holders
of RSUs the cash payments described in this _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ on or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and, in any event, no
later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two (2)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

 



 

(iv) The Company shall provide that each performance share unit granted under
the 2013 Plan (each, a " _PSU_ ") that is outstanding at the First Effective
Time, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled as of the First Effective Time. With respect to
each PSU for which the applicable performance period (including any cumulative
performance period) has ended prior to the First Effective Time and for which
the applicable performance goals (including any cumulative performance goals)
or other vesting criteria were not satisfied as of the end of the applicable
performance period, such PSUs shall be cancelled in accordance with this
_Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ for no consideration. With respect to (x) all PSUs for
which the applicable performance period (including any cumulative performance
period) has not ended prior to the First Effective Time, or (y) for which the
applicable performance period has ended prior to the First Effective Time and
the applicable performance goals and other vesting criteria were satisfied as
of the end of the applicable performance period, in consideration for the
cancellation of such PSU in accordance with this _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_, the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash in respect of
the cancellation of such PSU equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares
subject to such PSU based on the achievement of the performance goals
attributable to such PSU (determined assuming achievement of one hundred
percent

 



      
 

 



 

(100%) of target levels) and (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any withholding Taxes. The Second Step Surviving
Corporation shall pay, or cause an Affiliate to pay, either directly or
through payroll, the holders of PSUs the cash payments described in this
_Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, and, in any event, no later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date that is at least two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date.

 



 

(v) At or prior to the First Effective Time, the Company, the Board and the
Compensation Committee of the Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to (A) effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.2(b)_, (B) provide that the 2013 Plan will
terminate as of the First Effective Time and (C) ensure that following the
First Effective Time no participant in the 2013 Plan will have any right
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of Parent, the Company, the First
Step Surviving Corporation, the Second Step Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Payment for Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement
with the Companys share registrar to act as paying agent in connection with
the First Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_. At or immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of
holders of Shares, sufficient funds to immediately pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, such funds shall be held in trust in an interest bearing
account with a New Zealand registered bank (such cash and any interest
thereon, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to the Second Step Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days thereafter), the Second Step Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each record holder, as of the First Effective Time, of (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the First
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares the surrender of such
Shares, for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration therefor; _provided
that_ (A) such letter shall be sent to a record holder only if such record
holders Shares are certificated or if delivery of such letter of transmittal
is required by applicable Law or the Paying Agents standard operating
procedures in order to enable the payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration or to effect the surrender of Book-Entry Shares; and (B) if no
such letter is so required to be sent to that record holder, the Paying Agent
will promptly, following Closing, proceed to arrange for the payment of the
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration to such record holder. If a letter of transmittal was
sent to a record holder, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall then be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares irrespective of whether a letter of transmittal was sent to
that record holder. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Second Step
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_, each Certificate
and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the First
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



 

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing, the Second Step Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Second
Step Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.3(c)_,
none of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Second Step Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to a holder of capital stock of the Company for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and the Merger Subs that
except (i) as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and the Merger Subs immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent or (ii) as
disclosed in the body of (i.e. not including the exhibits or incorporated
documents) the SEC Reports (as defined herein) filed after March 15, 2013, and
prior to the date of this Agreement, that are publicly available (other than
any forward looking disclosures set forth under the captions "Risk Factors",
"Forward-Looking Statements" and any other disclosures contained or referenced
therein to the extent such disclosures are predictive, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature) and, provided that the disclosure in the SEC Reports shall
not qualify the Companys representations and warranties contained in
_Sections 3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.16_ , _3.17_ and _3.20_ :

 



 

SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined herein) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
the concept of good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, with such exceptions relating to the Companys
Subsidiaries (other than the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

"significant subsidiaries" within the meaning of Rule 1-02(w) promulgated by
Regulation S-X of the SEC) that would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to a liability that is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or licensed which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. The Company has
heretofore filed with the SEC a complete and correct copy of (a) its Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") and (b) its amended and restated by-laws, as amended to date
(the " _By-laws_ "). The Company has provided Parent and the Merger Subs with
complete and correct copies of certificates of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case
as of the date of this Agreement. The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-
laws are in full force and effect and no amendments thereto have been approved
by the Board. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of its
Certificate of Incorporation or any provisions of its By-laws in any material
respect. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is in violation of its certificate
of incorporation or by-laws or other applicable constituent documents, with
such exceptions that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, give rise to a liability that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Company Plan_ " shall mean
any "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the rules and

contributed or required to be contributed to, by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any current or
potential liability.

 



 

(b) With respect to each material Company Plan, the Company has made available

Service (the " _IRS_ "), (iii) the current summary plan description and any
material modifications thereto, (iv) the most recent annual financial and

material respects, in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the

other applicable Laws, rules and regulations. All premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Company Plan have been timely made
or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Companys Most Recent
Financial Statements. No actions, suits, investigation or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case, against any Company Plan
or the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) in respect of any Company Plan,
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the assets of any of the trusts under
such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or against any
fiduciary of the Company Plans with respect to the operation of such plans.

 



 

(d) None of the Company, or any ERISA Affiliate has within the preceding six
years sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or been obligated to contribute
to a plan (i) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or
4971 of the Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or (iii) a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two
of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of
ERISA. None of the Company Plans provide retiree health or life insurance
benefits except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 of ERISA, any other applicable Law or at the expense of the participant or
the participants beneficiary.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
combination with another event): (i) entitle any employee, consultant or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement or as required by applicable Law, (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, consultant or officer, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, (iii) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of
any compensation or benefits due, to any Employee or consultant or with
respect to any Company Plan or (iv) increase any benefits otherwise payable

the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantors have
committed, subject only to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in
Parent, directly or indirectly, the aggregate cash amounts set forth therein
(the " _Equity Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the

There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the

any of the Guarantors will not perform their respective funding obligations
under the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and

adversely affect the amount, conditionality or availability or termination of
the Debt Financing)), pursuant to which, and subject only to the terms and
conditions expressly set forth therein, the Financing Sources have committed
to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent and/or Merger Subs for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
"); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Agreement, the Debt Financing shall
also

amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Subs and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as such enforceability
may be subject to (i) the Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity.
No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subs
under any term, or a failure of any condition, of any of the Debt Commitment
Letter, or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable or delayed. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies relating to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, neither Parent nor either Merger Sub has reason to believe that
it could be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of any
of the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it, nor does Parent
have Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that any of the Financing
Sources will not perform the respective funding obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and conditions. Parent and

 **ARTICLE VI.**

 



 

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

SECTION 6.1 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall (a) as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, take all action
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ "), (b) subject to _Section 6.5_ , include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Recommendation_ ") and
(c) subject to _Section 6.5_ , use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote (including using reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies from the Companys stockholders). The Company shall keep Parent
updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by
Parent. The Company will convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting no later
than the thirtieth (30th) day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Stockholders Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of the
Common Shares and Preferred Shares present or represented by proxy at the
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Stockholders Meeting, (ii)
the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting by
applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or the NZX, or (iii) the Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel to the Company, that such action is necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Law is provided to
the Companys stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this
Agreement. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , its obligations pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 6.1_ shall not be affected by the making of an Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Board or the occurrence of an Intervening Event
except as expressly set forth in this _Section 6.1_

 



 

SECTION 6.2 _Securities Filings_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within ten (10) Business Days hereof), the Company shall,
with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC and submit for
review by the NZX a preliminary proxy statement (as amended and supplemented,
the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to
_Section 6.5_ , the Company shall include the Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company will cooperate with each
other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be distributed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the date the SEC and the NZX, respectively, each confirms
that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) If the Company is required to file any document other than the Proxy
Statement with the SEC or the NZX in connection with the Merger pursuant to
applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " _Other
Required Company Filing_ "), then the Company will promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC or the NZX. The Company will
cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the NZX Rules.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and each Merger
Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act, the NZX Rules and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement or an Other Required Company
Filing, as and to the extent requested by the Company. The Company shall not
file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which
comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC and NZX comments with respect
to the Proxy Statement or an Other Required Company Filing as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy Statement or Other
Required Company Filing in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC or the NZX
and mailed (if required by applicable Law) to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC and
submission to the NZX. The Company, prior to responding to SEC or NZX comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, will
first provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel.
Each of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company agree to promptly correct any
material information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or Other
Required Company Filing that shall, to the Knowledge of such party, have
become false or misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
NZX with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing
and any request by the SEC or the NZX for any amendment to the Proxy Statement
or Other Required Company Filing or for additional information.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates is
required to file any document with the SEC or the NZX in connection with the
Merger or the Stockholders Meeting pursuant to applicable Law (an " _Other
Required Parent Filing_ "), then Parent and the Merger Subs will, and will
cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other
Required Parent Filing with the SEC or the NZX. Parent and the Merger Subs
will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other
Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the
NZX Rules. Neither Parent or the Merger Subs nor any of their respective
Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment
thereto) with the SEC or the NZX without first providing the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent
will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel.

 



 

SECTION 6.3 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by Parent
reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company, in each case, effective at the First Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the First Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of their
Representatives to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access,
at all reasonable business hours to its officers, employees, properties,
offices, and other facilities and to all books and records, and shall furnish
Parent with all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent,
through its Representatives, may from time to time reasonably request in
writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would, in the opinion of counsel, reasonably
be expected to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or
contravene any applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and each Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or the Merger
Subs in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 3, 2015, between
the Company and Insight Venture Partners, LLC (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to (whether
directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, investment bankers, representatives, advisors or other
intermediaries (" _Representatives_ ")) nor shall (directly or indirectly) the
Company authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives
to: (i) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any
inquiries with respect to, or the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its
properties, books and records or any confidential information or data to, any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (v) agree to resolve
to take, or take, any of the actions prohibited by the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv); _provided, however_ , it is understood and agreed that
any determination or action by the Board permitted under _Section 6.5(b)_ or
_Section 6.5(e)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of this
_Section 6.5(a)_. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and shall instruct its and their
Representatives to, (A) immediately cease any and all existing activities,
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
parties hereto) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, (B)
take such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary
and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
standstill agreement (including any standstill provision contained in any
confidentiality or other agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party, unless, solely with respect to this
clause (C), the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board under applicable Law. The Company shall promptly after the
date of this Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal with or for the
benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information, documents and materials relating to an Acquisition Proposal or to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or its businesses, operations or affairs
heretofore furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in accordance
with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person and terminate
any "data room" or similar access of such Persons and their Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.5(a)_ , nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) complying with Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Board to the Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication), or from making any disclosure if the Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable
Law,

 



      
 

 



 

( _provided_ , that neither the Company nor the Board may recommend any
Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by _Section 6.5(e)_ and the Company may
not fail to make, or withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent
all or any portion of, the Recommendation unless in compliance with _Section
6.5(f)_ ); (iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing
access to its properties, books and records and providing information or data
in response to a request therefor by a Person or group who has made a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof (it being
understood that such Person or group may have engaged in discussions with the
Company prior to the date hereof and may submit an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal following the date hereof), not resulting from a breach of _Section
6.5(a)_ , if the Board receives from the Person so requesting such information
an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to
Parent) on terms that are no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement must contain a standstill provision) and, to the
extent nonpublic information that has not been made available to Parent is
made available to such Person, make available or furnish such nonpublic
information to Parent substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such Person; or (iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting
and engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person or group and
their respective Representatives who has made an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof (it being understood that such Person or group
may have engaged in discussions with the Company prior to the date hereof and
may submit an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal following the date hereof), not
resulting from a breach of _Section 6.5(a)_ , if, and only if, prior to taking
such action as set forth in the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv), the Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors (A) that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board under applicable Law and (B) that, such Acquisition Proposal,
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or occurrence of any Acquisition Proposal or the
determination of the existence of an Intervening Event, as applicable, of (i)
the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including
the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal and if
applicable, providing copies of any written inquiries, requests, proposals or
offers and any proposed agreements relating thereto, which may be redacted to
the extent necessary to protect confidential information of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal) or the Intervening Event, as applicable and (ii)
any request for non-public information or to engage in negotiations or
discussions that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not
to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill
or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the
provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Company
may waive any such provision in response to an Acquisition Proposal to the
Board made under circumstances in which the Company is permitted under this
_Section 6.5_ to participate in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
but only to the extent necessary to allow it to respond to such Acquisition
Proposal as permitted under this _Section 6.5_. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
Intervening Event, as applicable, and keep Parent reasonably informed as to
the material details of all developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding the

 



      
 

 



 

financial and any other material terms of the Acquisition Proposal or request
(including by providing, within 24 hours after receipt thereof, copies of all
drafts of proposed agreements relating thereto which may be redacted to the
extent necessary to protect confidential information of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(d) Except as permitted by _Section 6.5(e)_ , the Board will not (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify, or propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, in any manner
adverse to Parent or each Merger Sub, the Recommendation, (ii) approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to
approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal (including,
for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of
such Acquisition Proposal by the Companys stockholders, which shall
constitute a failure to recommend against such Acquisition Proposal), or to
publicly re-affirm the Recommendation, in each case, within five (5) Business
Days following an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced (or
such fewer number of days as remain prior to the Stockholders Meeting, as it
may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement) (any of the
actions described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (v) approve, recommend, declare
advisable or enter into any definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, a confidentiality agreement
as contemplated by _Section 6.5(b))_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.5_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote:

 



 

(i) if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of
this _Section 6.5_ , that (A) such proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or the
Board may effect such Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence,
and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless (x) the Company complies with the provisions of
_Section 6.5(c)_ and _(f)_ in all respects prior to terminating this Agreement
and (y) concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent the
Termination Fee and enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; or

 



 

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal as provided in clause (i) above, the Board may only effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to any Intervening Event if the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is
inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , the Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence
unless the Company complies with the provisions of _Section 6.5(c)_ and _(f)_
in all respects.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted under (i) _Section
6.5(e)(ii)_ , the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) Business Days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor and, during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
the terms of this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need to effect a
Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) _Section 6.5(e)(i)_ , the Company shall
provide Parent with three (3) Business Days prior written notice (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the amount or form of
consideration payable in connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal
shall require a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period)
advising Parent that the Board intends to take such action, and specifying the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and that the Company
shall, during such three (3) Business Day period (or subsequent two (2)
Business Day period), negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more
of any class or series of Company Securities, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
made following the date hereof (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified, it being understood that the Person or group
making such Acquisition Proposal may have engaged in discussions with the
Company prior to the date hereof and may make an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal following the date hereof) involving (A) assets that generate more
than 50% of the consolidated total revenues, (B) assets that constitute more
than 50% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or (C) more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company, in each case that the Board in good faith determines (after
consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial

 



      
 

 



 

advisors, who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm) would,
if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the
transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account all such factors
and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Board, including legal (with
the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of
any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other aspects of such proposal and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event or development or material
change in circumstances with respect to, and specific to, the Company that
materially improves the business, assets, or operations of the Company and was
(A) not actually known to, or reasonably expected by, the Board as of the date
of this Agreement; (B) becomes known to the Board prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote; and (C) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided that_ any change in the market price or trading volume of the
Companys stock will not constitute an Intervening Event (it being understood
that the facts giving rise or contributing to such change may be deemed to
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there is an
Intervening Event).

 



 

SECTION 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of and after the Closing, Parent will, or will cause the Second Step
Surviving Corporation to, or, where approval of a third party provider is
required, use commercially reasonable efforts to, give Company Employees full
credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not
(i) for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans,
(ii) to the extent this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service, or (iii) for purposes of eligibility or benefits
under any post termination welfare benefits) under any employee compensation
and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies
and arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
participate from and after the Closing Date for the Company Employees service
with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a "
_Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company or any
Subsidiary immediately prior to the First Effective Time. With respect to each
Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), the Parent or its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Company Plan or other
agreement, plan, program or document. Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall
obligate Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Second Step
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to employ any
person for any period of time after the First Effective Time, and this
_Section 6.6_ shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent to alter
the terms and conditions of, or terminate, the employment of any person.
Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.6_ , the provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, and no current or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or any other Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of the Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.6_ shall be construed to restrict in any way the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) amend, terminate or
modify the duties, responsibilities or employment of any Company Employee,
(ii) amend, terminate or modify any Company Plan or any compensation or
benefit arrangement or any other employee benefit plans or programs maintained
by Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Second Step Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates at any time or from time to
time, or (iii) grant any Employee any special right for compensation.

 



 

SECTION 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
may have under any indemnification agreement, employment agreement or Company
Plan, from the Closing through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the
Closing occurs, to the full extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall
cause the Second Step Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party, against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in
connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") to which an Indemnified Party is a
party or with respect to which an Indemnified Party is otherwise involved
(including as a witness), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Proceeding arising
out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether such Proceeding is commenced, or any claim or
matter therein is asserted or claimed, prior to, at or after the First
Effective Time. In the event of any such Proceeding, (x) neither Parent nor
Second Step Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party (which term, shall include only those Persons
who are officers, or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the date of this Agreement) hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (y) the Second Step
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Second Step Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors, officers and employees than those set forth in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws as of the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 



 

(c) The Company shall purchase, prior to the First Effective Time, a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing

 



      
 

 



 

substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the First Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that the premium amount to be paid
for such "tail policy" shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage in its last full fiscal year.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any
Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Closing) on or prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this _Section
6.7_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Second Step Surviving Corporation or Parent or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in _Section 6.6_ and this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

SECTION 6.8 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its best efforts to (and, in the case of Parent, cause each member of the
Parent Group to) (A) take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (B) do (or cause
to be done) all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing (or causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary,
proper or advisable pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger,
including by:

 



 

(i) causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied;

 



 

(ii) (A) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Entities; and (B) making all registrations, declarations and
filings with Governmental Entities, in each case that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the Merger;

 



 

(iii) obtaining all consents, waivers and approvals and delivering all
notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts and Leases in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to

 



      
 

 



 

maintain and preserve the benefits to the Second Step Surviving Corporation of
such Material Contracts and Leases as of and following the consummation of the
Merger;

 



 

(iv) executing and delivering any Contracts and other instruments that are
reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger; and

exemptions, orders, authorizations and making all registrations, declarations
and filings, in each case that are necessary or advisable in connection
therewith.

 



 

(b) In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, neither Parent or any Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company,
on the other hand, will take any action, or fail to take any action, that is
intended to have, or would reasonably be expected to have, the effect of
preventing, impairing, delaying beyond the Termination Date or otherwise
materially and adversely affecting (i) the consummation of the Merger; or (ii)
the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with _Section 6.5_ will be considered a violation of this _Section
6.8_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.8_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to agree (and without Parents consent shall not
agree) to the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other

including in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material
Contract.

 



 

SECTION 6.9 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby

Governmental Entity and of any communication received or

 



      
 

 



 

given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case in
connection with any Antitrust Law relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference

any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences, in each case in connection with any
Antitrust Law relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 6.8_ and this _Section 6.9_ , if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by
the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of Parent and the Merger Subs shall, the Company shall use its best
efforts to, and Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group to take all
such further action to, resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit

order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved,
could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to compliance with the NZX Rules on the part of the Company..

extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and

otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, termination, license or other

interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights (including any
rights or Contracts to acquire equity interests or assets, other than pursuant
to this Agreement), products or businesses of Parent and the Merger Subs (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and (B) any other restrictions on the
activities of Parent and the Merger Subs (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any Proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger.

 



 

SECTION 6.10 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and each
Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
or New Zealand securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject, wherever situated, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide the other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood

 



      
 

 



 

that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the
extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.10_ shall not apply to any public release or public announcement (x) made or
proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
a Superior Proposal or an Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken
pursuant thereto or (y) in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
each Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters
if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (other than as
expressly set forth therein); (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
Closing Date or adversely impact the ability of Parent to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
adversely impact the ability of Parent, the Merger Subs or the Company, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
each Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee
Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (or
on such other terms as are permitted by _Section 6.11_ or _Section 6.17_ or
agreed to in writing by the Company), (ii) enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing, on the terms and conditions materially
consistent with the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "flex" provisions applicable thereto set forth in the Debt Fee Letters),
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable
to Parent and the Merger Subs in the Commitment Letters that are within their
control (except that such obligation shall not be breached in respect of any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of any of
the Companys failure to furnish the information set forth in _Section 6.17_ ,
notwithstanding Parents reasonable best efforts), (iv) comply with its
obligations pursuant to the Commitment Letters and (v) enforce its rights
pursuant to the Commitment Letters. In the event that all conditions contained
in the Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the
availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied and Parent is
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2_ , Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause each Financing Source and shall cause
each Guarantor to fund its respective committed portion of the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date (including subject to
_Section 9.10(b)_ , by promptly commencing a litigation proceeding against any
breaching Financing Source or Guarantor to compel such breaching Financing
Source or Guarantor to provide its respective committed portion of the

 



      
 

 



 

Financing, provided that Parent shall control all aspects of such proceeding,
including litigation strategy and selection of counsel); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the
Parent to seek specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing the Financing Sources obligation to cause the Debt Financing
to be funded shall be subject to the requirements that (A) the Equity
Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Debt
Financing is funded at the Closing and (B) Parent has irrevocably confirmed
that if the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are funded, then it would take
such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur. In
addition, Parent shall have the right to substitute other debt financing for
all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter from the same and/or alternative financing sources so long as (x) such
substitution does not, as compared to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Fee Letters on the date of this Agreement,
increase the amount of Debt Financing required to be funded on the Closing
Date to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to (1) prevent, delay or impair the ability of Parent
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (2) adversely impact the ability of Parent or any Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and
(y) the Company shall have consented in writing to such substituted Debt
Financing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon conditions not less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent, Merger Subs and the Second Step Surviving Corporation,
taken as a whole, than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters), as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later
than the Closing Date) (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain
one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate
Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt
Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole
or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New
Debt Commitment Letters and any fee letter in connection therewith (redacted
to omit the numerical amounts and "flex provisions" provided therein and any
other customarily redacted provisions thereof, none of which would adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of the
Alternate Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing). In the event that any
New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" will be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by
one or more New Debt Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Subs shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
or any applicable Alternate Debt Financing, and (ii) promptly provide the
Company with copies of all executed amendments, modification or replacements
of the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that any amendments,
modifications or replacements shall only be as permitted herein) or material
definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subs shall promptly notify the
Company (A) of any material breach or material default by any party to the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent becomes aware, (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Subs of any
written notice or written communication from the Guarantors or any Financing
Source with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing of any provisions of any Commitment Letter or such definitive
agreements and (C) if for any reason, any of Parent or Merger Subs at any time
believes it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing in
an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on substantially similar terms from the sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing.

 



 

(e) Parent and Merger Subs each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes (including liability arising out of
any real estate transfer Tax, but excluding any income or similar tax), and
all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of
the Merger shall be borne by the Second Step Surviving Corporation. The Second
Step Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for the preparation and filing
of all Tax Returns relating to such Taxes.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause the Merger Subs, the First Step Surviving Corporation and
the Second Step Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement.

combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the date of this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing in this _Section 6.14_ shall be construed to permit any Party to do
any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any
other Partys rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company
shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause
dispositions of Company

transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 



 

SECTION 6.16 _Parent Vote_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the

Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense,
reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing

Agreement and does not unreasonably interfere in any material respect with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by
the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent:

pledging of collateral;

 



 

(iii) furnishing Parent and Parents Financing Sources and their respective

Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any expenses and costs
incurred in connection with the Companys or its Affiliates obligations under
this _Section 6.17(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its

Effective Time or to approve the execution or delivery of any document or
certificate in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing),
(ii) enter into any definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing prior

required to take any action under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing (including entry into any agreement that is effective before the First
Effective Time) or that would be effective prior to the First Effective Time.
Nothing in this Agreement will require any officer or Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or

this agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such officer or Representative.

Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such logos (i) are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or would reasonably be likely

or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives pursuant
to this _Section 6.17_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall be

_Section 3.3_ shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the
First Effective Time with the same force and effect as if made on and as the
First Effective Time (except that those representations and warranties which

warranties to be so true and correct are de minimis, (ii) the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.1_ , _Section 3.2_ ,
_Section 3.4_ , _Section 3.8(a)(ii)_ , _Section 3.17_ and _Section 3.20_ shall

in this Agreement shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any
materiality qualifications set forth in any such representation or warranty)
as of the date hereof and as of the First Effective Time with the same force
and effect as if made on and as of the First Effective Time (unless any such
representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event
such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
specified date), except where the failure of such representations and

through the Closing and the consummation of the Merger; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company continues to perform its obligations under this Agreement
during such time and the Closing occurs no later than the Business Day (New
Zealand time) immediately following the Delisting Date.

 



 

(b) On the Delisting Date, Parent will provide to the Company, for the purpose
of giving the same to the NZX, a certificate stating that Parent considers
each of the conditions in _Sections 7.1(a)_ to _7.1(c)_ , and _Section 7.2_ to
be satisfied and will irrevocably be deemed to continue to be satisfied
pending Closing; _provided_ , if the Company is not delisted from the NZX Main
Board on the Delisting Date or if the Closing does not occur on the Business
Day (New Zealand time) immediately following the Delisting Date, in each such
case such certificate shall automatically be deemed revoked and of no further
force or effect.

Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this

Commitment Letters, any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith or therewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith.

circumstances will the Company be entitled to, and in no event shall the
Company seek to recover, monetary damages from any Parent Related Party (other

excess of the amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) prior to a
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, subject
to this _Section 9.10_ , the parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, and this right shall include the right of the Company
to cause Parent and Merger Subs to fully enforce (A) the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter against the Guarantors to the fullest extent permissible

terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter and (B) subject to
_Section 6.11(b),_ the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter against the
Financing Sources to the fullest extent permissible under the Debt Commitment
Letter, including that the Equity Financing has been funded, in accordance
with the terms of, or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof, at
the Closing if the Debt Financing is funded at the Closing, and to thereafter

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with this Agreement; and (ii)
the right to specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and
without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parents and the Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger only in
the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the
Marketing Period has ended and the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at Closing, provided that each such condition is
capable of being satisfied at Closing) or waived at the time the Closing would
have occurred but for the failure of the Funding to be funded, (B) the Debt
Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or the
Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that it will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that
(x) all conditions to the Companys obligations to consummate the Closing set
forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing,
provided that each such condition is capable of being satisfied at Closing)
and (y) if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then
the Closing will occur.

 



 

(c) The parties agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and the Merger Subs, on the other hand; and (ii) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and the Merger Subs pursuant
to this Agreement, in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), on the basis that
damages would be an adequate remedy for such breach, threatened breach or
noncompliance. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
9.10_ , a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement or
the Guarantees (including monetary damages), and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 9.10_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 9.10_ (prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
_Section 9.10_ or anything set forth in this _Section 9._ 10 restrict or limit

_Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or the
Guarantees that may be available then or thereafter.

and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the

such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in
said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in such courts. _T_ he parties hereby

Preferred Shares, together with any other Shares the voting power of which is
acquired by such Stockholder during the period from the date hereof through
the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
(such period, the " _Voting Period_ "), are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Subject Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent, Diamond Merger Sub I, Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merger Sub II (" _Merger Sub I_
") and Diamond Merger Sub II, Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub II_ ") are concurrently entering into an
agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub I shall be merged with and

mergers referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
the " _Merger_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the written consent or
affirmative vote of (i) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
then outstanding Preferred Shares, consenting or voting separately as a class
and (ii) the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding
Preferred Shares and Common Shares, entitled to vote thereon, voting as one
class; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, which
transactions from which the Stockholder believes it will derive substantial
benefits through its ownership interest in the Company, the Stockholder is
entering into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 

**

 

 **DEFINITIONS**

 



 

SECTION 1.1 _Capitalized Terms_. For purposes of this Agreement, capitalized
terms used and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
to them in the Merger Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no amendment or
modification to any such term in the Merger Agreement shall amend or modify
its meaning for the purposes hereof without the prior written consent of
Stockholder.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE II 

**

 

 **VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY**

 



 

SECTION 2.1 _Agreement to Vote_. The Stockholder hereby agrees that, during
the Voting Period, at any duly called meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), or in any other
circumstances (including action by written consent of stockholders in lieu of
a meeting) upon which a vote, adoption or other approval or consent with
respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement or the approval of the Merger
and any of the transactions contemplated thereby is sought, the Stockholder
shall, if a meeting is held, appear at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and
shall provide a written consent or vote (or cause to be voted), in person or
by proxy, all its Subject Shares, in each case (i) in favor of (A) any
proposal to adopt and approve or reapprove the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and (B) waiving any notice that may have
been or may be required relating to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, and (ii)
against (X) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, (Y) any
Acquisition Proposal and any action in furtherance of any such Acquisition
Proposal and (Z) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that, to the
knowledge of the Stockholder, would reasonably be expected to result in a
material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Stockholder or the Company under this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. If requested by Parent, the
Stockholder shall appoint Parent and any designee of Parent, and each of them
individually, as the Stockholders proxy, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote during the Voting Period with respect to any and all
of the Subject Shares on the matters and in the manner specified in _Section
2.1_. The Stockholder shall take all further action or execute such other
instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of any such proxy.
The Stockholder affirms that any irrevocable proxy given by it with respect to
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be given
to Parent by the Stockholder to secure the performance of the obligations of
the Stockholder under this Agreement. It is agreed that Parent (and its
officers on behalf of Parent) will use the irrevocable proxy that may be
granted by the Stockholder only in accordance with applicable Law and that, to
the extent Parent (and its officers on behalf of Parent) uses any such
irrevocable proxy, it will only vote the Subject Shares

 



      
 

 



 

subject to such irrevocable proxy with respect to the matters specified in,
and in accordance with the provisions of, _Section 2.1_.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Nature of Irrevocable Proxy_. Any proxy granted pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ to Parent by the Stockholder shall be irrevocable during the
term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all
prior proxies or powers of attorney granted by the Stockholder and no
subsequent proxy or power of attorney shall be given or written consent
executed (and if given or executed, shall not be effective) by the Stockholder
with respect thereto. Any proxy that may be granted hereunder shall terminate
upon the termination of this Agreement, but shall survive the death or
incapacity of the Stockholder and any obligation of the Stockholder under this
Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives and
successors of the Stockholder.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 _Additional Consideration_. If the Merger is consummated, the
Stockholder will not receive, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, any
consideration additional to or in lieu of (i) the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the acquisition of the Preferred Shares held or
controlled by it or its Affiliates and (ii) the Common Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the acquisition of any Common Shares held or
controlled by it or its Affiliates. If the Merger is not consummated, neither
the Stockholder nor any of its Affiliates will receive a break-fee or similar
payment, whether under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 

**

 

 **COVENANTS**

 



 

SECTION 3.1 _Subject Shares_.

 



 

(a) The Stockholder agrees that (i) from the date hereof until the Closing
Date, it shall not, and shall not commit or agree to, without Parents prior
written consent, directly or indirectly, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, offer for sale, sell (including short sales), transfer, tender,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by gift)
(collectively, a " _Transfer_ "), or enter into any contract, option,
derivative, hedging or other agreement or arrangement or understanding
(including any profit-sharing arrangement) with respect to, or consent to or
permit, a Transfer of, any or all of the Subject Shares or any interest
therein; and (ii) during the Voting Period it shall not, and shall not commit
or agree to, without Parents prior written consent, (A) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney with respect to any or all of the Subject Shares or agree
to vote the Subject Shares on any matter or divest itself of any voting rights
in the Subject Shares, (B) take any action that would have the effect of
preventing or disabling the Stockholder from performing its obligations under
this Agreement, or (C) convert any of its Preferred Shares into Common Shares;
_provided_ , that the Stockholder may Transfer up to 500,000 Common Shares
after the record date for the Stockholders Meeting (retaining voting rights in
respect of the matters to be voted on at the Stockholders Meeting) and prior
to the Closing Date. The Stockholder agrees that any Transfer of Subject
Shares not permitted hereby shall be null and void and that any such
prohibited

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer may and should be enjoined. If any involuntary transfer of any
Subject Shares covered hereby shall occur (including, but not limited to, a
sale by the Stockholders trustee in bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at
any creditors or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein,
shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the
initial transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of
the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) In the event of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the
Subject Shares by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up,
recapitalization, combination, conversion, exchange of shares or the like, the
term "Subject Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include the Subject
Shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and any
securities into which or for which any or all of the Subject Shares may be
changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction. The
Stockholder further agrees that, in the event Stockholder purchases or
otherwise acquires beneficial or record ownership of or an interest in, or
acquires the right to vote or share in the voting of, any additional Shares,
in each case after the execution of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall
deliver promptly to Parent written notice of such event, which notice shall
state the number of additional Shares so acquired. The Stockholder agrees that
any such additional Shares shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement,
including all covenants, agreements, obligations, representations and
warranties set forth herein as if those additional shares were owned by the
Stockholder on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.2 _Stockholder s Capacity; Stockholder Designees_. All agreements
and understandings made herein shall be made solely in the Stockholders
capacity as a holder of the Subject Shares and not in any other capacity. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge that if the Stockholder has a nominee or
Affiliate on the Companys board of directors (the " _Board_ "), the parties
agree that (i) such nominee or Affiliate of the Stockholder on the Board
(each, a " _Stockholder Designee_ ") shall be free to act in his capacity as a
director of the Company solely in accordance with his duties to the Company
and its stockholders, (ii) nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any
Stockholder Designee from taking any action (or omitting to take any action)
in facilitation of the exercise of his fiduciary duties pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 6.5_ of the Merger Agreement or otherwise and (iii)
no action taken by a Stockholder Designee or the omission by a Stockholder
Designee to take any action, acting in his or her capacity as a director of
the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach by the Stockholder of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.3 _Other Offers_. Neither the Stockholder (in the Stockholders
capacity as such), nor any of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall,
nor shall the Stockholder or any of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any,
authorize or permit any of its or their respective Representatives to, and the
Stockholder shall instruct, and cause each applicable Subsidiary of the
Stockholder to instruct, each such Representative not to, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions: (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any designees of Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II) any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub I,

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub II or any designees of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II)
access to the properties, books, records or other non-public information of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case, with the intent to
induce the making, submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage,
an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than, in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 3.3_ or _Section
6.5_ of the Merger Agreement); or (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by any Subsidiary of the Stockholder or Representatives of the Stockholder or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 3.3_
by the Stockholder. The Stockholder shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
and each shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives, to immediately cease any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
limit or affect any actions taken by the Stockholder (or any affiliated
officer or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement,
including taking any of the foregoing actions that would be permitted to be
taken by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.4 _Communications_. During the Voting Period, the Stockholder, and
each of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors,
employees or other Representatives, if any, not to, directly or indirectly,
make any press release, public announcement or other public communication that
criticizes or disparages this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, without the prior written
consent of Parent, provided that the foregoing shall not limit or affect any
actions taken by the Stockholder (or any affiliated officer or director of the
Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement, including taking any of the
foregoing actions that would be permitted to be taken by the Company pursuant
to the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder hereby (i) consents to and authorizes
the publication and disclosure by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the
Company (including in any publicly filed documents relating to the Merger or
any transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement) of: (a) the
Stockholders identity; (b) the Stockholders beneficial ownership of the
Subject Shares; and (c) the nature of the Stockholders commitments,
arrangements and understandings under this Agreement, and any other
information that Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Company determines
to be necessary in any SEC disclosure document in connection with the Merger
or any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) agrees as
promptly as practicable to notify Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the
Company of any required corrections with respect to any written information
supplied by the Stockholder specifically for use in any such disclosure
document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit or affect
any actions taken by the Stockholder (or any affiliated officer or director of
the Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.5 _Voting Trusts_. The Stockholder agrees that it will not, nor will
it permit any entity under its control to, deposit any of its Subject Shares
in a voting trust or subject any of its Subject Shares to any arrangement with
respect to the voting of such Subject

 



      
 

 



 

Shares other than as provided herein.

 



 

SECTION 3.6 _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, exercise or perfect (or
attempt to exercise, assert or perfect) any rights of appraisal or rights to
dissent from the Merger that it may at any time have under applicable Law,
including Section 262 of the DGCL. The Stockholder agrees not to commence,
join in, facilitate, assist or encourage, and agrees to take all actions
necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any
claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, the Company or any of their
respective successors, directors or officers, (a) challenging the validity,
binding nature or enforceability of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of,
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, or (b) alleging a breach of any
fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or

 **VOTING AGREEMENT**

 



 

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of February
12, 2016, by and among Diamond Parent Holdings, Corp., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ ") and the undersigned (together, the " _Stockholders_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the sole record and
beneficial owner of and has the sole power to vote (or to direct the voting
of) (x) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per
share (the " _Preferred Shares_ "), of Diligent Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), set forth opposite such Stockholders name on
_Schedule I_ hereto and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share the (" _Common Shares_ ") of the Company, set forth opposite
such Stockholders name on _Schedule I_ hereto (such Common Shares and
Preferred Shares, together with any other Shares the voting power of which is
acquired by the Stockholders during the period from the date hereof through
the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
(such period, the " _Voting Period_ "), are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Subject Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent, Diamond Merger Sub I, Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merger Sub II (" _Merger Sub I_
") and Diamond Merger Sub II, Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub II_ ") are concurrently entering into an
agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub I shall be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
thereafter and (ii) the Company shall then be merged with and into Merger Sub
II, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving corporation thereafter (the
mergers referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
the " _Merger_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the written consent or
affirmative vote of (i) the holders of at least sixty percent (60%) of the
then outstanding Preferred Shares, consenting or voting separately as a class
and (ii) the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding
Preferred Shares and Common Shares, entitled to vote thereon, voting as one
class; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parents willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, which
transactions from which each Stockholder believes it will derive substantial
benefits through its ownership interest in the Company, the Stockholders are
entering into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE I 

**

 

 **DEFINITIONS**

 



 

SECTION 1.1 _Capitalized Terms_. For purposes of this Agreement, capitalized
terms used and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
to them in the Merger Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no amendment or
modification to any such term in the Merger Agreement shall amend or modify
its meaning for the purposes hereof without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 

**

 

 **VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY**

 



 

SECTION 2.1 _Agreement to Vote_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees that, during
the Voting Period, at any duly called meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), or in any other
circumstances (including action by written consent of stockholders in lieu of
a meeting) upon which a vote, adoption or other approval or consent with
respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement or the approval of the Merger
and any of the transactions contemplated thereby is sought, such Stockholder
shall, if a meeting is held, appear at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and
shall provide a written consent or vote (or cause to be voted), in person or
by proxy, all its Subject Shares, in each case (i) in favor of (A) any
proposal to adopt and approve or reapprove the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and (B) waiving any notice that may have
been or may be required relating to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, and (ii)
against (X) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, (Y) any
Acquisition Proposal and any action in furtherance of any such Acquisition
Proposal and (Z) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that, to the
knowledge of such Stockholder, would reasonably be expected to result in a
material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of such Stockholder or the Company under this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. If requested by Parent, each
Stockholder shall appoint Parent and any designee of Parent, and each of them
individually, as such Stockholders proxy, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote during the Voting Period with respect to any and all
of the Subject Shares on the matters and in the manner specified in _Section
2.1_. Each Stockholder shall take all further action or execute such other
instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of any such proxy.
Each Stockholder affirms that any irrevocable proxy given by it with respect
to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be
given to Parent by such Stockholder to secure the performance of the
obligations of such Stockholder under this Agreement. It is agreed that Parent
(and its officers on behalf of Parent) will use the irrevocable proxy that may
be granted by the Stockholders only in accordance with applicable Law and
that, to the extent Parent (and its officers on behalf of Parent) uses any
such irrevocable proxy, it will only vote the Subject Shares

 



      
 

 



 

subject to such irrevocable proxy with respect to the matters specified in,
and in accordance with the provisions of, _Section 2.1_.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Nature of Irrevocable Proxy_. Any proxy granted pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ to Parent by a Stockholder shall be irrevocable during the term
of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient
in law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior
proxies or powers of attorney granted by such Stockholder and no subsequent
proxy or power of attorney shall be given or written consent executed (and if
given or executed, shall not be effective) by such Stockholder with respect
thereto. Any proxy that may be granted hereunder shall terminate upon the
termination of this Agreement, but shall survive the death or incapacity of
such Stockholder and any obligation of such Stockholder under this Agreement
shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives and successors of
such Stockholder.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 _Additional Consideration_. If the Merger is consummated, neither
Stockholder will receive, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, any
consideration additional to or in lieu of (i) the Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the acquisition of the Preferred Shares held or
controlled by it or its Affiliates and (ii) the Common Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the acquisition of any Common Shares held or
controlled by it or its Affiliates. If the Merger is not consummated, neither
the Stockholders nor any of their respective Affiliates will receive a break-
fee or similar payment, whether under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 

**

 

 **COVENANTS**

 



 

SECTION 3.1 _Subject Shares_.

 



 

(a) Each Stockholder agrees that (i) from the date hereof until the Closing
Date, it shall not, and shall not commit or agree to, without Parents prior
written consent, directly or indirectly, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, offer for sale, sell (including short sales), transfer, tender,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by gift)
(collectively, a " _Transfer_ "), or enter into any contract, option,
derivative, hedging or other agreement or arrangement or understanding
(including any profit-sharing arrangement) with respect to, or consent to or
permit, a Transfer of, any or all of its Subject Shares or any interest
therein; and (ii) during the Voting Period it shall not, and shall not commit
or agree to, without Parents prior written consent, (A) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney with respect to any or all of its Subject Shares or agree
to vote its Subject Shares on any matter or divest itself of any voting rights
in its Subject Shares, (B) take any action that would have the effect of
preventing or disabling such Stockholder from performing its obligations under
this Agreement, or (C) convert any of its Preferred Shares into Common Shares;
_provided_ that the Stockholders may Transfer up to 500,000 common shares in
the aggregate after the record date for the Stockholders Meeting (retaining
voting rights in respect of the matters to be voted on at the Stockholders
Meeting) and prior to the Closing Date. Each Stockholder agrees that any
Transfer of Subject Shares not permitted hereby shall be null and void and
that any such

 



      
 

 



 

prohibited Transfer may and should be enjoined. If any involuntary transfer of
any Subject Shares covered hereby shall occur (including, but not limited to,
a sale by a Stockholders trustee in bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at
any creditors or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein,
shall include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the
initial transferee) shall take and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of
the restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) In the event of a stock dividend or distribution, or any change in the
Subject Shares by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, split-up,
recapitalization, combination, conversion, exchange of shares or the like, the
term "Subject Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include the Subject
Shares as well as all such stock dividends and distributions and any
securities into which or for which any or all of the Subject Shares may be
changed or exchanged or which are received in such transaction. Each
Stockholder further agrees that, in the event such Stockholder purchases or
otherwise acquires beneficial or record ownership of or an interest in, or
acquires the right to vote or share in the voting of, any additional Shares,
in each case after the execution of this Agreement, such Stockholder shall
deliver promptly to Parent written notice of such event, which notice shall
state the number of additional Shares so acquired. Each Stockholder agrees
that any such additional Shares shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including all covenants, agreements, obligations, representations
and warranties set forth herein as if those additional shares were owned by
such Stockholder on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.2 _Stockholder s Capacity; Stockholder Designees_. All agreements
and understandings made herein shall be made solely in each Stockholders
capacity as a holder of the Subject Shares and not in any other capacity. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties acknowledge that if a Stockholder has a nominee or
Affiliate on the Companys board of directors (the " _Board_ "), the parties
agree that (i) such nominee or Affiliate of such Stockholder on the Board
(each, a " _Stockholder Designee_ ") shall be free to act in his capacity as a
director of the Company solely in accordance with his duties to the Company
and its stockholders, (ii) nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any
Stockholder Designee from taking any action (or omitting to take any action)
in facilitation of the exercise of his fiduciary duties pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 6.5_ of the Merger Agreement or otherwise and (iii)
no action taken by a Stockholder Designee or the omission by a Stockholder
Designee to take any action, acting in his or her capacity as a director of
the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach by such Stockholder of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.3 _Other Offers_. Neither Stockholder (in the Stockholders capacity
as such), nor any of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall, nor shall
the Stockholders or any of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, authorize
or permit any of its or their respective Representatives to, and the
Stockholders shall instruct, and cause each applicable Subsidiary of the
Stockholders to instruct, each such Representative not to, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions: (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any designees of Parent, Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II) any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub I,

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub II or any designees of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II)
access to the properties, books, records or other non-public information of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case, with the intent to
induce the making, submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage,
an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than, in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 3.3_ or _Section
6.5_ of the Merger Agreement); or (iv) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by any Subsidiary of a Stockholder or Representatives of a Stockholder or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 3.3_ by
such Stockholder. The Stockholders shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, and each shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives, to immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall limit or affect any actions taken by a Stockholder (or any affiliated
officer or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement,
including taking any of the foregoing actions that would be permitted to be
taken by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.4 _Communications_. During the Voting Period, the Stockholders, and
each of the Stockholders Subsidiaries, if any, shall not, and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees or other Representatives, if any, not to, directly or
indirectly, make any press release, public announcement or other public
communication that criticizes or disparages this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, without
the prior written consent of Parent, provided that the foregoing shall not
limit or affect any actions taken by a Stockholder (or any affiliated officer
or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement, including
taking any of the foregoing actions that would be permitted to be taken by the
Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Each Stockholder hereby (i) consents
to and authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent, Merger Sub I,
Merger Sub II and the Company (including in any publicly filed documents
relating to the Merger or any transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) of: (a) such Stockholders identity; (b) such Stockholders
beneficial ownership of the Subject Shares; and (c) the nature of such
Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement, and any other information that Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II
or the Company determines to be necessary in any SEC disclosure document in
connection with the Merger or any transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (ii) agrees as promptly as practicable to notify Parent, Merger
Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company of any required corrections with respect
to any written information supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use
in any such disclosure document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall limit or affect any actions taken by a Stockholder (or any affiliated
officer or director of the Company) in compliance with the Merger Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.5 _Voting Trusts_. Each Stockholder agrees that it will not, nor

 



      
 

 



 

will it permit any entity under its control to, deposit any of its Subject
Shares in a voting trust or subject any of its Subject Shares to any
arrangement with respect to the voting of such Subject Shares other than as
provided herein.

 



 

SECTION 3.6 _Waiver of Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, exercise or perfect (or
attempt to exercise, assert or perfect) any rights of appraisal or rights to
dissent from the Merger that it may at any time have under applicable Law,
including Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Stockholder agrees not to commence,
join in, facilitate, assist or encourage, and agrees to take all actions
necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any
claim, derivative or otherwise, against Parent, the Company or any of their
respective successors, directors or officers, (a) challenging the validity,
binding nature or enforceability of, or seeking to enjoin the operation of,
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, or (b) alleging a breach of any
fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or
entry into the Merger Agreement.

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

SECTION 6.1 _Termination_. This Agreement shall automatically terminate, and

the Stockholders; (b) the First Effective Time; (c) the date of termination of
the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; or (d) the date of any
material modification, waiver or amendment of the Merger Agreement that

Stockholders. The parties acknowledge that upon termination of this Agreement
as permitted under and in accordance with the terms of this _Article VI_, no
party to this Agreement shall have the right to recover any claim with respect
to any losses suffered by such party in connection with such termination,
except that, subject to _Section 7.11_, the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve either party to this Agreement from liability for such
partys willful and material breach of any terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Article VI_ and _Article VII_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

SECTION 7.7 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that without consent Parent may
assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its
Affiliates that assume the rights and obligations of Parent under the Merger
Agreement. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, each Stockholder agrees that this
Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall be binding upon any Person to
which record or beneficial ownership of each Stockholders Subject Shares
shall pass, whether by operation or law or otherwise, including such
Stockholders heirs,

 



      
 

 



 

guardians, administrators or successors and assigns, and such Stockholder

SECTION 7.8 _Parties in Interest_. Subject to _Section 3.2_, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto,
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set
forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be an
express third party beneficiary solely of the provisions of _Section 3.4_
hereof. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.3_ without notice
or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date (except the Company solely with respect to
_Section 3.4_ hereof).

 



 

SECTION 7.9 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented in accordance with the terms hereof, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Each of the parties
has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if drafted by all the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. References to dollars of "US$" are to
the official currency of the United States of America. This Agreement shall be
construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

 



 

SECTION 7.10 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND
IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED,

 



      
 

 



 

CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO THE
EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 



 

SECTION 7.11 _Specific Performance_. Each Stockholder acknowledges that any
breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that the Company and
Parent shall be entitled to seek enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
any of the provisions of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy, which shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement by a Stockholder shall be
the injunction(s) and specific performance set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

 



 

SECTION 7.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if the Chancery Court declines jurisdiction, the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or the courts of the State of
Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit
or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with relating to such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and
determined in such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such
court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 7.4_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

SECTION 7.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

 



      
 

 



 

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7.13_.

 



 

SECTION 7.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form), each of which shall
be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
facsimile or otherwise) to the other parties.

 



 

SECTION 7.15 _Relationship of the Parties_. This Agreement has been negotiated
on an arms length basis between the parties and is not intended to create a
partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and the Stockholders have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

ARTICLE IX. 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

Section 1. _Indemnification_. The Corporation, to the fullest extent
permitted or required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ ") or other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, shall indemnify and hold harmless any person who is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation and who is or was involved in any
manner (including, without limitation, as a party or a witness) or is
threatened to be made so involved in any threatened, pending or completed
investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including, without limitation, any action,
suit or proceedings by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor) (a " _Proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while serving
as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other entity or enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee
benefit plan) (an " _indemnitee_ ") against all liability and loss suffered
and expenses (including attorneys fees), actually and reasonably incurred by
such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good
faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the
persons conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Article IX, Section 1, but subject to applicable law, the Corporation
shall be required to indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding
(or part thereof) commenced by such indemnitee only if the commencement of
such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the indemnitee was authorized in the
specific case by the Board.

 



 

Section 2. _Prepayment of Expenses_. The Corporation, to the fullest extent
permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, shall pay the
expenses incurred by an indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding in advance
of the final disposition of such Proceeding consistent with the provisions of
the DGCL or other applicable law, provided, however, that such payment of
expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding

 



      
 

 



 

shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnitee to repay
all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Article IX or otherwise.

 



 

Section 3. _Insurance, Contracts and Funding_. The Corporation, to the fullest
extent permitted or required by the DGCL or other applicable law, may purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust or other entity or enterprise (including, without limitation, any
employee benefit plan) against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons
status as such, in connection with any Proceeding, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The Corporation may enter into
contracts with any indemnitee providing indemnification and advancement of
expenses and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other
means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the
payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as
provided or authorized in this Article IX, by statute, by agreement or
otherwise.

 



 

Section 4. _Indemnification Not Exclusive Right; Beneficiaries of Rights_.
The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and costs
to any indemnitee under this Article IX, or the entitlement of any indemnitee
to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article IX,
shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation to
indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such indemnitee in any other way
permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which
any indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs
may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such indemnitees
capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as
to action in any other capacity. The rights conferred on any indemnitee by
this Article IX shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and other legal
representatives of any indemnitee under this Article IX. Any amendment,
alteration or repeal of this Article IX that adversely affects any right of an
indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit,
eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



 

Section 5. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions
of this Article IX with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE X.

 

AMENDMENTS.

 



 

The Board of Directors shall have the power to make, rescind, alter, amend and

to rescind, alter, amend or repeal any bylaws made by the Board of Directors,
and to enact bylaws which if so expressed shall not be rescinded, altered,

for the annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors shall
