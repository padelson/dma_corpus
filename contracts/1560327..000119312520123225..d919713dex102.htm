pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_, shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment Statement," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment Items" and
each shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement and on all
Stockholders, unless the Equityholder Representative timely delivers to
Purchaser an Objection Notice (as defined below) in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 1.12(c)_. If Purchaser fails to timely deliver the Closing Adjustment
Statement, at the Equityholder Representatives election, the Equityholder
Representative may hire (at Purchasers sole cost and expense) an independent
accountant to prepare the Statements and, in the case Equityholder
Representative hires an independent accountant to prepare the Statements, the
dispute process in _Section_ __ _ 1.12(c)_ shall apply in a reciprocal
fashion.

(c) In the event that the Equityholder Representative disputes the
Closing Adjustment Statement or the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items,
the Equityholder Representative shall notify Purchaser in writing (the
"Objection Notice") of the amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within 30
calendar days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_. Any such Objection Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which the Equityholder
Representative disagrees (the "Disputed

 



9

    

 Line Items"), and the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment
Statement and the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items delivered pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_. If Equityholder Representative fails to timely
deliver an Objection Notice, the amounts set forth in the Closing Adjustment
Statement shall be deemed to be final and binding on the Parties. In the
event of a dispute, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall first
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the Disputed Line Items in order
to determine the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items, which amount shall
not be more than Purchasers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.12(b)_ nor less than the Equityholder Representatives calculation delivered
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.12(c)_. If Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative reach a final resolution on the Disputed Line Items within 30
days after Purchasers receipt of the Objection Notice (or within any
additional period as mutually agreed to between Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative), then the Closing Adjustment Statement agreed
upon by Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall be deemed for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment
Statement," the Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment
Items" and each shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement
and on all Stockholders.

(d) If Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative are unable to resolve
the Disputed Line Items within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the
Objection Notice, then any remaining Disputed Line Items shall be submitted to
Grant Thornton LLP or another accounting firm or entity mutually acceptable
to the Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (the "Neutral
Accountant"). All determinations and calculations pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 1.12(d)_ shall (i) consider only the Disputed Line Items that remain in
dispute, (ii) be a value that is not more than Purchasers calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_ nor less than the
Equityholder Representatives calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.12(c)_, (iii) be in writing, and (iv) be delivered to Purchaser and the
Equityholder Representative as promptly as practicable, and in any event,
within thirty (30) days from the date that the dispute is submitted to it.
Absent Fraud or manifest error, the Closing Adjustment Statement as finally
determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed for purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment Statement," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ to be the "Final Closing Adjustment Items" and
each shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement and on all
Stockholders. In determining the Closing Adjustment Statement and the Closing
Adjustment Items, the Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and not as
arbitrator. A judgment on the determination made by the Neutral Accountant
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ may be entered in and enforced by any
court having jurisdiction.

 

(e) The Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders) shall each bear its own fees and expenses in connection with
the resolution of disputes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be
borne by the Equityholders, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, in proportion to the amounts by which the respective proposals of
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative differed from the Neutral
Accountants final determination.

 

(f) The "Final Closing Adjustment" shall be equal to (i) the amount of the
Final Closing Adjustment Items, minus (ii) the Estimated Closing Adjustment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Final Closing Adjustment may be a positive or
negative number. If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than zero (0) but
less than the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, then Purchaser shall
remit, promptly (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days) after the
date of determination of the Final Closing Adjustment, an amount equal to the
difference between the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount and the
Final Closing Adjustment to the Company and the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Equityholders pro rata in accordance the Payment Schedule.
If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount, but less than the Holdback Amount, then the Purchasers
obligation to pay the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount shall be
terminated and the Indemnity Holdback Amount shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the difference between the Final Closing Adjustment and the Purchase
Price Adjustment Holdback Amount. If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater
than the Holdback Amount, the Purchasers obligation to pay the Holdback
Amount shall be terminated and Purchaser shall have the right to seek payment

 



10

    

 for the amount that the Final Closing Adjustment exceeds the Holdback Amount
directly against the Equityholders. If the Final Closing Adjustment is less
than zero (0), then promptly (and in no event later than two (2) Business
Days) after the date of determination of the Final Closing Adjustment, the
Purchaser shall remit an amount equal to the Final Closing Adjustment _plus_
the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount to the Company and the Paying
Agent for further distribution to the Equityholders pro rata in accordance the
Payment Schedule. Payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(f)_ shall be
treated for all purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(g) The parties agree that the procedures set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 1.12 _shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any disputes
with respect to the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Statement,
the Final Closing Adjustment Items and the Final Closing Adjustment;
provided, that this provision shall not prohibit Purchaser or the Equityholder
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the
Neutral Accountant.

 



     | 1.13 |

Withholding. 

---|---|--- 
 

Purchaser the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
to any holder or former holder of capital stock of Company pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any
Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent determines that an amount is required to be so
deducted and withheld, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Person with notice of its intent to deduct and withhold at least five days
prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled to be made (which notice
will include a reference to the applicable provision of the Code or other Tax
Law pursuant to which such deduction or withholding is required) and
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Person to
eliminate or reduce the basis for such deduction or withholding (including
providing such Person with a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding). To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, and delivered to the applicable
state, local or foreign tax authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. If Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent withholds any amounts from any payment
otherwise due pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will provide such Person, within ten (10)
Business Days following the date of such payment, written documentation
evidencing that such amounts were paid to the applicable Governmental
Authority.

     | 8.3 |

Tax Matters. 

---|---|--- 
 

(a) The Equityholder Representative shall cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns relating to the Company for all Tax periods ending on
or before the Closing Date (except income Tax Returns relating to the Company
for the Stub Period (as defined below)) (such Tax periods, the "Pre-
Closing Tax Periods"), prepared consistent with past practice and all Legal
Requirements, and the Equityholders shall pay all Taxes (including state and
federal income and franchise taxes) (and all filing and preparation fees
associated therewith) relating to the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Periods
when due and taking into account timely filed extensions. All positions taken
on such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns shall be taken in good faith
consistent with applicable Legal Requirements. The Equityholder Representative
shall cause to be delivered the Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns to
Purchaser at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the filing thereof to
review and provide reasonable comments, and the Purchaser and Equityholder
Representative will endeavor in good faith to resolve any difference with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns. If the Equityholder
Representative and the Purchaser cannot resolve any such difference after such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, then such disputed items shall be submitted
to the Neutral Accountant for resolution in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.12(d)_ of this Agreement. The Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all income Tax Returns relating to the Company
attributable to all periods beginning after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing
Tax Periods"), and shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due all Taxes relating
to the Company attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Periods.

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all income Tax Returns relating to the Company for the stub
period starting on January 1, 2020 and ending on the Closing Date (the "Stub

Period Tax Returns shall be taken in good faith consistent with applicable
Legal Requirements. The Purchaser shall deliver Stub Period Tax Returns at
least fifteen (15) days before the filing thereof to the Equityholder
Representative for review and reasonable comment, and the Purchaser and
Equityholder Representative will endeavor in good faith to resolve any
difference with respect to Stub Period Tax Returns. If the Equityholder
Representative and the

 Purchaser cannot resolve any such difference after such fifteen (15)
Business Day period, then such disputed items shall be submitted to the
Neutral Accountant for resolution in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_
of this Agreement.

(c) The Parties shall cause, to the maximum extent possible under
applicable Legal Requirements, any taxable period of the Company that would
otherwise be a Straddle Period to end on the Closing Date. In order to
apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to the Straddle Period,
Purchaser shall cause the Company, to the extent permitted by Legal
Requirements, to elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to treat for all Tax
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the
Company. In any case where applicable Legal Requirements does not permit the
Company to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or
period, for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax payable with
respect to a Straddle Period will be allocated between the period of the
Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through (and including)
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the period of the
Straddle Period that extends from the day immediately after the Closing Date
to the end of the Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period"). The
portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes not based on income, gross receipts or profits earned
during a Straddle Period, such Taxes shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable year or period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case
of any Tax based on or measured by income, gross receipts or profits earned
during a Straddle Period, on an interim closing of the books by assuming that
the books of the Company were closed at the end of the day on the Closing
Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing
Straddle Period on a daily basis. The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of the Company for any
Straddle Period ("Straddle Return"). All positions taken on such Straddle
Return shall be taken in good faith consistent with applicable Legal
Requirements. The Purchaser and the Company shall deliver the Straddle Return
at least ten (10) Business Days before the filing thereof to the Equityholder
Representative to review and consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the Purchaser and Equityholder
Representative will endeavor in good faith to resolve any difference with
respect to Straddle Return. If the Equityholder Representative and the
Purchaser cannot resolve any such difference after such fifteen (15) Business
Day period, then such disputed items shall be submitted to the Neutral
Accountant for resolution in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.12(d)_ of this
Agreement. Taxes attributable to the Straddle Period and allocated to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period (and all filing and preparation fees associated
therewith) as set forth above shall be timely paid by the Sellers and Taxes
attributable to the Straddle Period and allocated to the Post-Closing Straddle
Period as set forth above shall be timely paid by the Company. The Company
shall provide evidence of the filing of any Straddle Returns to the
Equityholder Representative and the Equityholder Representative shall provide
evidence of the filing of any Straddle Returns to the Company, and each party
shall coordinate and provide evidence of the payment of any Taxes applicable
to such party to the other party. Neither the Purchaser nor the Company may
settle any Tax claim for any material amount of Taxes resulting from an audit
of the Company initiated by a Governmental Authority for which any of the
Sellers may be liable pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Equityholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. 

(d) The Company shall promptly notify the Equityholder Representative in
writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which might affect
the Liabilities for Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable under _Section_
__ _ 8.3_. The Equityholder Representative shall have the sole right to
represent the Companys interest in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding which might affect the Liabilities for Taxes for which the
Equityholders may be liable under  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_. In the case of a
Straddle Period, the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser shall have
the right to represent the Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding which might affect the Liabilities for Taxes for which the
Equityholders may be liable under _Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

 



35

    

(e) After the Closing Date, the Equityholders and the Purchaser shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
Agreement and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes,
in each case, to the extent they relate to periods before or including the
Closing Date. Each party will make available to the other parties, as
reasonably requested, all information, records or documents relating to
liability for Taxes for all periods before or including the Closing Date and
will preserve such information, records or documents until the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof.

 

(f) Any Tax refunds of the Company attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation

(g) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Rollover Amount
shall be treated as part of the Merger Consideration with respect to the
Retained Key Owners and shall not, for any purposes, be treated as or
considered compensation, and the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that they will not take any contrary position to the foregoing.

---|---|--- 
 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have purchased an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail") for its present and
former directors and officers (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") which shall
provide such DandO Indemnified Parties with coverage for six (6) years
following the Effective Time on substantially comparable terms and conditions
as the existing coverage applicable to the DandO Indemnified Parties immediately
prior to the Effective Time. All costs of the DandO Tail shall be borne by the
Company and shall be treated as a Company Transaction Expense at Closing.

 

(b) For the six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, without the prior
consent of the Equityholder Representative, cancel, amend or otherwise limit
the DandO Tail.

 

(c) In addition to the DandO Tail, for the six (6) years following the
Effective Time, the Purchaser and its successors and assigns shall maintain
in effect any contract of the Company set forth on _Schedule 8.4(c)_ , or any
company organizational document pursuant to which any DandO Indemnified Party
has a right to indemnification, contribution, or advancement as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) This _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (i) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, (ii) is intended to benefit each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs, (iii) shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and shall be
enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties and (iv) shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any DandO
Indemnified Party under this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ without the written
consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party.

Appointment. 

---|---|---

at a stockholders meeting or by written consent and without any further
action of any of the Equityholders or the Company) will irrevocably grant to
and appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as their exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact
(with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of
each of the Equityholders, with the same effect as if taken by each of
the Equityholders, with full power and authority to take any and all actions
and execute any and all documents and agreements under this Agreement and the
Representative Engagement Agreement in each Equityholders name, place and
stead, with the same effect as if such action were taken or such document or
agreement were executed (i) by each of the Equityholders in connection with
any matter or thing relating to any amendments to this Agreement and (ii) by
each of the Equityholders in connection with any claim made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9_, including, without limitation, the power and authority to

(b) The Equityholder Representative hereby accepts the appointment as the
"Equityholder Representative" hereunder. The Equityholder Representative
cannot be removed except upon delivery to the Purchaser of a written
instrument signed by each of the Equityholders. The
Equityholder Representative may resign for any reason or no reason, at any
time. If the Equityholder Representative resigns or is so removed, then a
replacement Equityholder Representative may (but need not be) designated by
all of the Equityholders. Any such replacement Equityholder Representative
will have the full power and authority of the Equityholder Representative
hereunder. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Equityholder Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement.
The signature of the Equityholder Representative on behalf of each of the
Equityholders shall be deemed to be the signature of each of the
Equityholders, as the case may be, and they shall be bound by the terms of
any such document relating to any claim made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9_
executed and delivered by the Equityholder Representative on their behalf
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ as though they were actual
signatories thereto. The Purchaser and any other Person shall be entitled to
rely, without any investigation or inquiry by the Purchaser or such Person,
upon all actions, notices, communications and determinations by the
Equityholder Representative, including without limitation, relating to any
claim made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9_ on behalf of each of the
Equityholders as having been taken upon the authority of each of the
Equityholders. The Equityholder

 



42

    

 Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Payment Schedule,
(ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii)
reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf
of the applicable Equityholder or other party. Any actions, notices,
communications and determinations by the Equityholder Representative,
including without limitation, relating to any claim made pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9_ on behalf of each of the Equityholders shall be
conclusively deemed to be the actions, notices, communications and
determinations of each of the Equityholders and shall be binding upon each
Equityholder and such Equityholders successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Equityholder, and neither the Purchaser nor any
other Person shall have any liability or responsibility to any of the
Equityholders for any action taken in reliance thereon. All defenses which
may be available to any Equityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the
action of the Equityholder Representative taken in good faith under this
Agreement or the Representative Engagement Agreement are
waived. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be
liable to the Equityholders for any actions or inactions of the Equityholder
Representative. The Equityholder Representative shall have no duties,
responsibilities or obligation to act on behalf of the Equityholders except
as expressly set forth herein and in the Representative Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Equityholder
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the
Disclosure Schedules. The relationship created herein is not to be construed
as a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the
Equityholder Representative or any of the Equityholders for any purpose of
federal or state law, including without limitation, federal or state income
tax purposes.

(c) The appointment of the Equityholder Representative and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Equityholder
Representative and the Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable by any Equityholder in any manner or for
any reason, (ii) shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution,
disability, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy or other inability to act of the
principal pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement and shall be binding
on any successor thereto and (iii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment
by any Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of such Equityholders
interest in the Holdback Amount.

 



     | 10.2 |

Liability of Equityholder Representative. 

---|---|--- 
 

Certain Equityholders have entered into an engagement agreement (the
"Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Equityholder Representative
with the Equityholder Representative to provide direction to the Equityholder
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement or the
Representative Engagement Agreement (such Equityholders, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). Neither the Equityholder Representative nor its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Representative Group")
shall be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the
Representative Engagement Agreement as Equityholder Representative while
acting in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Equityholders shall severally but not jointly indemnify, defend and hold the
Representative Group harmless against any Damages incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative Group and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder or under the Representative Engagement Agreement, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any third party retained by the
Equityholder Representative and costs in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers (collectively, the "Representative Expenses"). Such Representative
Expenses may be recovered first, from the Expense Fund, second, from any
distribution of the Holdback Amount otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Equityholders in proportion to such Equityholders portion of the Merger
Consideration that is received by such Equityholder. The Equityholders
acknowledge that the Representative shall not be required to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement the Representative Engagement Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Equityholder Representative
shall not be required to take any action unless the Equityholder
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its

 



43

    

 determination, are sufficient to protect the Equityholder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Equityholder Representative in performing such actions.



     | 10.3 |

Expense Fund. 

---|---|--- 
 

Upon the Closing, the Purchaser shall wire to the Equityholder Representative
$150,000 (the "Expense Fund Amount"). The Expense Fund Amount shall be held
by the Equityholder Representative in a segregated client account and shall be
used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Equityholder
Representative for any Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this
Agreement or any Representative Engagement Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise
determined by the Representative Group (the "Expense Fund"). The Equityholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations
or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Equityholder Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Equityholders will not receive any interest on the Expense Fund and assign to
the Equityholder Representative any such interest. Subject to Representative
Group approval, the Equityholder Representative may contribute funds to the
Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders. As soon as reasonably determined by the Equityholder
Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the
Equityholder Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund (if
any) to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Equityholders;
provided that the party making such distribution shall be entitled to deduct a
reasonable fee for the cost of processing such payment. For tax purposes, the
Expense Fund Amount shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Equityholders at the time of Closing. Any Tax
required to be withheld with respect to the deemed payment to an Equityholder
of its portion of the Expense Fund Amount shall reduce the amount of cash
payable to such Equityholder at Closing and shall not reduce the Expense
Fund.

without the prior written approval of Purchaser, unless required by any
Legal Requirement (in which event a satisfactory opinion of counsel to that

approvals of Stockholders and other third parties contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise to comply with the terms of this Agreement, and except

reasonable efforts to provide Company with a copy of any proposed press
release or other public communication announcing the Merger, enabling Company

is reasonably appropriate.

Conflict of Interest. 

---|---|--- 
 

Without the need for any consent or waiver by the Company or Purchaser, Miles
and Stockbridge P.C. ("Miles") shall be permitted to represent the
Equityholders, or any one or more of them, after the Closing in connection
with any matter, including without limitation, anything related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements
referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Miles shall be
permitted to represent the Equityholders, any of their agents and Affiliates,
or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction
or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary
proceeding) with Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as
claims or disputes arising under other

 



46

    

 agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with
respect to any indemnification claims. Upon and after the Closing, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any attorney-client
relationship with Miles, unless and to the extent Miles is specifically
engaged in writing by the Company and the Surviving Corporation to represent
the Company and the Surviving Corporation after the Closing and either such
engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Equityholders
or the Equityholder Representative consents in writing at the time to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation by Miles after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing
provisions hereof.



     | 11.5 |

Attorney Client Privilege. 

---|---|--- 
 

All communications involving attorney-client confidences between an
Equityholder, its Affiliates or the Company and Miles in the course of
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences and communications (the "Privileged Materials"). Following the
Closing the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Privileged
Materials may be waived only by the Equityholder Representative. Neither the
Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert that the attorney-client
privilege of the Company related to the Merger was waived due to the
inadvertent transfer of attorney-client privileged material after the Closing
(either because they were included in the computer server(s) of the Company
and the Surviving Corporation or were otherwise within the records of the
Company and the Surviving Corporation after the Closing).



     | 11.6 |

Miscellaneous. 

---|---|---

signed by Purchaser and Company; and

(ii) After Closing, this Agreement may be amended by an instrument signed
by Purchaser and Equityholder Representative.

(iii) Prior to Closing, either Party may by written notice to the other
Party (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

document delivered pursuant hereto by the other Party, and (c) waive

of Purchaser or any Stockholder, respectively, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of Purchaser or any Stockholder,
respectively, contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
by Purchaser or any Stockholder, respectively and (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements of Purchaser or any Stockholder, respectively, or any

(v) Any amendment, extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party (which in the case of any
Stockholders after the Closing, means the Equityholder Representative) to be
bound thereby.

 

(vi) The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any such rights. 

(b) If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties

without the express written consent of Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign this
Agreement to an Affiliate or lender of Purchaser without the consent of the
Equityholder Representative, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser
of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.

(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement (other
than as expressly set forth under _Section_ __ _ 9_).

 

(g) This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related
hereto or to the transaction contemplated hereby or to the inducement of any

performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and that each party
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
