on the one hand, and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party.
For example, if the Seller Representative claims the aggregate Merger Consideration is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Parent, and if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Seller
Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be allocated thirty percent (30%) (<I>i.e.</I>, 300 &divide; 1,000) to the Parent and seventy percent (70%)
