are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

1.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time, the
Merger Sub shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

(b) At the Merger Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a
certificate of merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ hereto
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as
the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time of such filing or such other time specified in the
Certificate of Merger, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and
be subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
consideration of the agreements contained herein and the Release and Support
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof:

 

(a) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:

 

(i) the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration; and

 

(ii) the Per Share Additional Merger Consideration.

 

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(a)_ is referred to herein as the " _Common
Stock Merger Consideration_ ".

 



2

    

(b) Each share of Common Stock, if any, held immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company shall be
canceled and no payment shall be made with respect thereto (the " _Excluded
Shares_ ").

 

(c) Each share of common stock of the Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Company.

 

(d) Each share of Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Preferred Stock
Consideration.

 

1.03 _Effect on Options_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, (i) each Unvested Option shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished, no longer be outstanding, and cease to represent the right to
acquire shares of Common Stock, for no consideration and (ii) each Vested
Option shall automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be
outstanding, and cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common
Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Option Consideration as provided herein and without the payment of
any interest. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide, by no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
(unless such seven (7) Business Day period is waived or shortened by the
Parent), to each Optionholder that has not delivered an Option Cancellation
Agreement on the date hereof a form Option Cancellation Agreement and request
that each such Optionholder execute such Option Cancellation Agreement at or
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, (w) after providing
a form of Option Cancellation Agreement to an Optionholder and requesting
execution thereof, the Company shall not have any further obligation to
solicit execution thereof, (y) the execution and delivery of an Option
Cancellation Agreement by any such Optionholder shall not be a condition to
the Securities Purchase Closing or the Merger Closing, and (z) the failure of
any such Optionholder to execute an Option Cancellation Agreement shall not
be deemed a breach of the Companys obligations under this Agreement.

(b) The Closing Option Consideration payable to the holders of Vested
Options pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03(a)_ above shall be paid through the
Companys payroll system (or directly by the Company in respect of any Vested
Options held by an individual other than a current or former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) on the first regularly scheduled payroll
date of the Company that occurs at least five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time, and the remaining portion of the Option Consideration payable
to the holders of Vested Options and any other amounts received by the Seller
Representative pursuant to this Agreement that is payable to the holders of
Vested Options and, at the request of the Seller Representative, paid to the
Surviving Company for payment through the Surviving Companys payroll system
or otherwise as directed by the Surviving Company, shall be paid on the first
regularly scheduled payroll date of the Surviving Company that occurs at
least five (5) Business Days following each such time as any such Option
Consideration or other amounts become payable to such holder, if any.

 



3

    

(c) The Option Consideration shall constitute the sole
consideration payable in respect of all Vested Options, and no other
consideration shall be paid in respect of any Vested Options. Promptly after
the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and its board of directors shall take all necessary actions to cause each
Option to be treated in accordance with _Sections_ __ _ 1.03_ and _1.12._

 

1.04 _Effect on Restricted_ _Shares; Note Obligations_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company and its
board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Equity Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to repurchase all outstanding Restricted Shares
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of the exercise notices pursuant to which such
Restricted Shares were issued. The payment of the repurchase price to be paid
by the Company in respect of any Restricted Shares shall, to the maximum
extent possible, be effected by offset against the Securityholders
obligations (the applicable " _Note Obligations_ ") under the Secured
Promissory Note (the applicable " _Secured Promissory Note_ "), if any, issued
by the Securityholder holding such Restricted Shares to the Company in
connection with such Securityholders purchase of such Restricted Shares.

 

(b) To the extent, after accounting for the repurchase of Restricted Shares
from a Securityholder and offset against any Note Obligations as described in
_Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_, such Securityholder would owe any remaining Note
Obligations to the Company, the aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration,
Option Consideration or other amounts in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby to be paid to such Securityholder, or such
Securityholders trusts, estate planning vehicles or other Affiliates, shall
be reduced by the amount of such remaining Note Obligations.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any remaining Note
Obligations after accounting for the offset or reduction contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_ and shall remain
outstanding and shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Secured Promissory Note of such Securityholder.

1.05 _Effect on Warrant_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the
Warrant Cancellation Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or of any
Securityholder, the Warrant shall automatically be canceled and extinguished
and in consideration therefor, the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive
the Warrant Consideration as provided herein and without the payment of any
interest.

(b) The Warrant Consideration payable to the Warrantholder pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.05(a)_ above shall be paid by the Paying Agent to the
Warrantholder in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.06_. The
Warrant Consideration shall constitute the sole consideration payable in
respect of the Warrant, and no additional consideration shall be paid in

 Stock and the Warrant, in each case, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and entitled to payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.02(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 1.02(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.05_. In connection
with such exchange, by no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (unless such five (5) Business Day period is waived or shortened
by the Seller Representative), the Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to
provide each Common Stockholder, Preferred Stockholder or Warrantholder on
record as of the end of the preceding Business Day (as applicable) with a
Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ F_
attached hereto, with such changes as may be required by the Paying Agent and
reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Seller Representative (a " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, the Paying Agent, the Parent
and the Seller Representative shall enter into a Paying Agent Agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ G_ attached hereto, with
such changes as may be required by the Paying Agent and reasonably acceptable
to the Parent and the Seller Representative (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_
"). At the Merger Closing, the Parent shall transfer to the Paying Agent via
wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to the
Closing Payment Amount. The Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to hold
such funds and deliver them in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof
and the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement. Each holder of
Common Stock, Preferred Stock or the Warrant, in each case, that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time may deliver to the
Paying Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and, solely
with respect to any certificated shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or
the certificate of the Warrant (as applicable), surrendered to the Paying
Agent each such certificate (or if any such certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, shall have delivered an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in customary form
and substance and including an agreement to indemnify the Parent and
the Surviving Company against all costs, liabilities, fees and expenses on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate (a "
_Lost Certificate Affidavit_ ")) and, after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to promptly deliver or cause to be delivered
to such holder by wire transfer (or, at the direction of such holder, by
check) an amount equal to the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled
under  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ to the accounts designated by such holder in
such holders Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ that the Parent shall instruct
the Paying Agent to deliver or cause to be delivered such amounts on
the Closing Date to any holder of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or the
Warrant that has delivered a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal
to and, solely with respect to any certificated shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock or the certificate of the Warrant (as applicable), each such
certificate representing such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or the
certificate of the Warrant (or if such certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, a Lost Certificate Affidavit), the Paying Agent at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In no event shall any holder of
Common Stock, Preferred Stock or the Warrant who delivers a Letter of
Transmittal and, solely with respect to any certificated shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock or the certificate of the Warrant, each such
certificate (or if such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a Lost
Certificate Affidavit), be entitled to receive interest on any of the funds
to be received in the Merger. All fees, costs and expenses of the Paying Agent
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and fifty percent (50%) by
the Participating Securityholders. Any shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock or the Warrant held by a holder thereof that has delivered a Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_ shall
not be transferable on the books of the Company without the Parents
prior written consent. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no issuance of shares

 



5

    

 of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and no further registration of transfers
of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or the Warrant theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or the Warrant, in each case,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock presented to the Surviving Company or the Parent for
any reason shall be converted into the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ without any interest thereon. Any
portion of the funds held by the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holder of shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock that has not previously complied with this _Section_ __ _
1.06_ prior to the end of such twelve (12) month period shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Common Stock
or Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent, the
Surviving Company nor their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for any amount paid to any
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar laws. Any amount remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock three (3) years after the date on which such funds
were delivered to the Paying Agent for payment (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

1.07 _Seller Representative Amount_. Concurrent with the Effective Time,
the Parent shall deliver to the Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) $1,000,000, or such higher amount as the Seller
Representative may designate in writing to the Company and the Parent
no later than 9:00 a.m., New York time, on the third (3rd) Business Days
prior to the Merger Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account(s) designated by the Seller Representative, to satisfy
potential future obligations of the Seller Representative and/or the
Securityholders to the Seller Representative, including expenses of the Seller
Representative arising from the defense or enforcement of claims pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 1.11_ and _11.01_ , as applicable (in the aggregate, the "
_Seller Representative Amount_ "). The Seller Representative Amount shall be
retained in whole or in part by the Seller Representative for such time as the
Seller Representative shall determine in its sole discretion. If the Seller
Representative shall determine in its sole discretion to return all or any
portion of the Seller Representative Amount to the Participating
Securityholders, it shall deposit such amount with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the Securityholders, which shall promptly distribute to each
Participating Securityholder its Pro Rata Share thereof; _provided_ that (i)
to the extent a Securityholder is a holder of Options, the
Seller Representative may deposit with the Surviving Company any portion of
such amount payable to such holder of Options for distribution by the
Surviving Company to such holder of Options in accordance with the terms
(including the timing and manner of payment) of _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ and, in
such circumstances, the amount deposited with the Paying Agent shall be
reduced accordingly and (ii) in the discretion of the Seller Representative,
the Seller Representative may make direct payments to one or more of the
Participating Securityholders of their respective Pro Rata Share thereof.

1.08 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended
and restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _
H_ until thereafter amended, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, in accordance
with the provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws
of the Surviving Company shall be amended and restated to be in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ I_, until thereafter amended, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_, in accordance with the provisions thereof, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company and the DGCL.

1.09 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, (a) the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and (b) except as determined
by the Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of the Merger Sub at
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each such
initial director and initial officer to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as in effect
from and after the Effective Time.

 

1.10 _Closing Calculations; Allocation Schedule_. No later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York time, on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Parent a statement setting
forth (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as
of the Reference Time, (b) a good faith calculation of the Companys estimate
of Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
") and Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), and (c)
the Closing Merger Consideration, the Closing Payment Amount, the aggregate
Closing Option Consideration and the Closing Warrant Consideration (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), in each case, including reasonably detailed
supporting information and calculations of the components thereof prepared by
the Company in good faith based on the Companys books and records. The
Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations contained therein shall be
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, the definitions hereof and the
Accounting Principles. Concurrently with the Companys delivery to the Parent
of the Estimated Closing Statement, the Company shall also deliver to the
Parent an allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), which shall set
forth: (i) the number of Fully Diluted Shares and its calculation; and (ii)
for each Securityholder, such Persons name, the number of shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock owned by such Person (in each case, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time after accounting for any repurchase of
Restricted Shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(a)_) and the number
of shares of Common Stock underlying Vested Options or Vested Warrant held by
such Person, as applicable, and such Persons share of the Closing Payment
Amount and Closing Option Consideration and such Persons Closing Warrant
Consideration, as applicable, prepared in accordance with this Agreement, the
Organizational Documents of the Company, the Company Equity Plan, the Option
Cancellation Agreement, the Warrant Cancellation Agreement and any other
applicable Contracts between any Group Company and any Securityholder. After
the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement and the Allocation Schedule,
Parent and its Representatives shall have reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon a reasonable advance request, to books and records and
any work papers of the Group Companies to the extent related to the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement and the Allocation Schedule.
The Company shall, in good faith, consider any potential adjustments to

 



7

    

 the Estimated Closing Statement and the Allocation Schedule reasonably
raised by the Parent prior to the Merger Closing and shall, if in the
Companys good faith determination it agrees with any such adjustment,
reflect such adjustments in the Estimated Closing Statement. Parent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the Allocation Schedule as setting forth the
true, correct and complete listing of all amounts due to be paid by or
on behalf of Parent to the Securityholders at the Merger Closing and the Pro
Rata Share of the Participating Securityholders, and in no event will Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) have any liability
to any Securityholder, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
on account of payments in such reliance on the Allocation Schedule.

 

1.11 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible,
but in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Parent
shall deliver to the Seller Representative (a) a consolidated balance sheet of
the Group Companies as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_
"), and (b) a statement showing the Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital
and Transaction Expenses (the " _Closing Statement_ ") in each case, including
reasonably detailed supporting information and calculations of the components
thereof prepared by the Parent in good faith based on the Companys books and
records. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared and Cash, Indebtedness,
Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses shall be determined in accordance
with this Agreement, the definitions hereof and the Accounting Principles.
The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and
determining Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses
and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.11_ is to measure the amount of Cash, Indebtedness, the difference between
Net Working Capital and the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and Transaction
Expenses and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
judgments with respect to setting the appropriate levels of reserves,
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies, in each case, that is different
or inconsistent with the definitions hereof or the Accounting Principles.
After delivery of the Closing Statement and in connection with the Seller
Representatives review of the Closing Statement, (i) the Seller
Representative and its accountants and other Representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access at normal business hours and upon a reasonable
advance request to review the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries books
and records and any work papers to the extent related to the preparation of
the Closing Statement and (ii) the Seller Representative and its accountants
and other Representatives may make inquiries of the Parent, the Surviving
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective accountants and employees, in
each case as designated by the Parent, regarding questions concerning or
disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review
thereof, and the Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. If the Seller Representative has any objections to the
Closing Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Parent a
statement setting forth its objections thereto with reasonably detailed
supporting information (an " _Objections Statement_ "). After delivery of the
Objections Statement and in connection with the Parents review of the
Objections Statement, the Parent and its accountants and other Representatives
shall be given access to any books, records and work paper related to the
preparation of the Objections Statement and to the Seller Representative and
its accountants and other Representatives in the same manner and to the same
extent as contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) above, _mutatis mutandis_. If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Parent within forty-five (45)
days following the date of delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement

 



8

    

 shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. The Seller
Representative and the Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within fifteen
(15) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller
Representative and the Parent shall submit such dispute to the New York office
of a Specified Accounting Firm reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the
Seller Representative, or if no such Specified Accounting Firm is willing and
able to serve, another independent accounting firm of national reputation
mutually acceptable to the Parent and the Seller Representative (the "
_Dispute Resolution Arbiter_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute.
The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only those items and amounts
that are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which the
Seller Representative and the Parent are unable to resolve, and any other
items and amounts impacted by the resolution of the items and amounts disputed
in the Objections Statement, and any other items set forth in the Closing
Statement shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties. The Dispute
Resolution Arbiters determination shall be based solely on the definitions of
Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained
herein and the Accounting Principles, including this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.
The Seller Representative and the Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Arbiter to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts between the disputed amounts
set forth in the Closing Statement and the Objections Statement. Further, the
Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by the Parent and the Seller Representative that are in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._
, not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute
by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final and binding on and non-
appealable by the Parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between the Parent, on the one hand,
and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other
hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such
Party. For example, if the Seller Representative claims the aggregate Merger
Consideration is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Parent, and
if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
the Seller Representative (for the benefit of the Securityholders) $300 of
the $1,000 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be
allocated thirty percent (30%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Parent and
seventy percent (70%) ( _i.e._ , $700 ÷ 1,000) to the Seller Representative
(on behalf of the Securityholders). In resolving each disputed item of the
Objections Statement, the Dispute Resolution Arbiter will be authorized only
to choose either the Seller Representatives position or the Parents
position for such item (as each position had been disclosed to the other in
its respective Objections Statement, as amended in the manner provided below),
but recognizing that the Dispute Resolution Arbiter may resolve the
Objections Statements on an item-by-item basis so that it may choose the
Seller Representatives position on some items and the Parents position on
other items.

1.12 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(a) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger
Consideration, (i) the Parent shall promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Merger
Consideration) pay to (A) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Common
Stockholders), the Stockholder Percentage of the amount equal to (x) such

Difference_ ") by wire transfer of 

 



9

    

 immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Paying Agent to the Parent, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to
each Common Stockholder its applicable portion thereof, (B) the Paying Agent
(for distribution to the Warrantholder), the Warrantholder Percentage of the
Positive Adjustment Difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the Paying Agent to the Parent, and
the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Warrantholder such amount,
and (C) the Surviving Company (for distribution to Optionholders in accordance
with the terms (including the timing and manner of payment) of  _Section_ __
_ 1.03_), the Optionholder Percentage of the Positive Adjustment Difference
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Surviving Company to the Parent, and (ii) the Seller
Representative and the Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to (x) the Paying Agent (for
distribution to the Common Stockholders), the Stockholder Percentage of the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount (less any fees, expenses and any portion thereof
that would be due to any Dissenting Stockholder) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Paying
Agent to the Parent, and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to each
Common Stockholder its applicable portion thereof, (y) the Paying Agent (for
distribution to the Warrantholder), the Warrantholder Percentage of the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by the Paying Agent to the Parent, and the
Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Warrantholder such amount and
(z) the Surviving Company (for distribution to the holders of Options in
accordance with the terms (including the timing and manner of payment) of
_Section_ __ _ 1.03_), the Optionholder Percentage of the Purchase Price
Escrow Amount (less any fees, expenses and any portion thereof that would be
due to any Dissenting Stockholder) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Surviving Company to the
Parent.

 

(b) If the Final Merger Consideration is equal to or less than the Closing
Merger Consideration, the Parent and the Seller Representative (on behalf of
the Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business
Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Parent the absolute value of such difference, if any (the " _Shortfall
Amount_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one (1) or more
accounts designated by the Parent to the Seller Representative. The Shortfall
Amount shall be paid solely from the funds available in the Escrow Account.
In the event that the funds available in the Escrow Account are in excess of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount (such excess less any fees, expenses and any
portion thereof that would be due to any Dissenting Stockholder, the "
_Escrow Excess Amount_ "), the Seller Representative and the Parent shall,
simultaneously with the delivery of the instructions described in the first
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.12(b)_, deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to pay to (i) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the
Common Stockholders), the Stockholder Percentage of the Escrow Excess Amount,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by the Paying Agent to the Parent and the Seller Representative,
and the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to each Common Stockholder its
applicable portion thereof, (ii) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the
Warrantholder), the Warrantholder Percentage of the Escrow Excess Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Paying Agent to the Parent, and the Paying Agent shall promptly
distribute to the Warrantholder such amount, and (iii) the Surviving Company
(for distribution to holders of Options in accordance with the terms
(including the timing and manner of payment) of _Section_ __ _ 1.03_) the
Optionholder Percentage of the Escrow Excess Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Surviving Company to the Parent and the Seller Representative. The
Securityholders and the Seller Representative shall not have any
liability for any amounts due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ or this
_Section_ __ _ 1.12_, except to the extent of the funds available in the
Escrow Account.

 



10

    

1.13 _Escrow Account_. Concurrent with the Effective Time, the Parent
shall deliver $10,500,000 (such amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") in
immediately available funds into a separate escrow account (the " _Escrow
Account_ "), which account shall be established and maintained by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ J_ attached hereto, with such
changes as may be required by the Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to
the Parent and the Seller Representative, to be entered into on the Closing
Date by the Parent, the Seller Representative and the Escrow Agent (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). (i) The entire amount contained in the Escrow Account
shall serve as a security for, and the sole and exclusive source of payment
of, the Parents rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.12_ and (ii) $7,500,000
(the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") contained in the Escrow Account shall
serve as a security for and source of payment of the Parent Indemnitees
rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ and the sole and exclusive source of
payment of Parent Indemnitees rights pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.02(b)_
and _Section_ __ _ 9.02(c)_. All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and fifty percent (50%) by
the Participating Securityholders. 

1.14 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any
share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Common Stockholder who did not consent to
or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, which Common Stockholder complies with all of the
provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters
rights (such share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common
Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share would
be entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ but rather shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders dissenters
rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive the consideration
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, pursuant to the exchange procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.06_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then
the right of a stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company
shall give the Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received
by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by or on behalf of the Company in respect of
the Dissenting Shares and (B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in all
material communications, negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL in respect of the Dissenting Shares. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of the Dissenting Shares.

 

1.15 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Company,
the Seller Representative, the

 



11

    

 Parent and each Securities Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Tax Law. If the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the
Surviving Company, the Seller Representative, the Parent or a
Securities Buyer, as the case may be, so withholds (or causes to be withheld)
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Escrow Agent, the Surviving Company, the Seller Representative, the Parent or
a Securities Buyer, as the case may be, made (or caused to be made) such
deduction and withholding. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Securities Purchase Closing, the Parent shall, shall cause the Surviving
Company and each Securities Buyer to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to instruct the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent to (a) notify the
Seller Representative and Securityholders of any anticipated withholding
(other than backup withholding or any withholding in respect of payments in
compensation for services), (b) consult with the Seller Representative and
Securityholders in good faith to determine whether such deduction and
withholding is required under applicable Tax Law, and (c) cooperate with the
Seller Representative and Securityholders in good faith to minimize the amount
of any applicable withholding. The Parent agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to instruct the Paying Agent to give notice to the Seller
Representative prior to any payment to any Securityholder of an amount payable
under this Agreement that the Paying Agent determines will be subject to
backup withholding.

 

1.16 _Reference Statement_. _Exhibit_ __ _ K_ sets forth an illustrative
statement prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation with the
Parent setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and
illustrating as of the date set forth therein, the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and Preferred Stock
Liquidation Preference prepared and calculated in accordance with this
Agreement, in each case, illustrating each component thereof.

for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with
respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Company Plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Company Plan, and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or

enable the Parent to have permissible access to such information in a manner
that would not result in loss of such privilege, conflict with such
confidentiality obligations or violation of the Law and, in the case of
confidentiality obligations to a third party, if requested by the Parent,
shall use reasonable efforts to secure applicable consents of the applicable
third party to permit such disclosure, in each case, at the Parents sole cost
and expense. The Parent and the Merger Sub each acknowledges that it is and
remains bound by the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement among the
Parent Guarantor, Genstar Capital Partners, LLC, and certain other parties,
dated January 17, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not a waiver,
of the closing conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.02)_; and (b) seek
all consents, waivers and approvals, make any filings and deliver all
notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to maintain and preserve the benefits to the

 



41

    

 Surviving Company of such Material Contracts, in each case of clauses _(a)_
and _(b)_ , at the Companys cost; provided, that the Company shall not be
obligated to pay any amount under clause _(a)_ or _(b)_ that it is not
otherwise contractually obligated to pay. The parties acknowledge and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall limit, expand
or otherwise modify in any way any efforts standard explicitly applicable to
any of the Companys obligations under this Agreement and (ii) the receipt of
any consents, waivers or approvals contemplated in  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a condition to the Securities Purchase
Closing or the Merger Closing. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with the
Parent in its procurement of any representations and warranties insurance
policy (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_"), which may be procured by the Parent
in its sole discretion in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder.

 

6.04 _Restructuring_. The Company shall (a) consummate the steps of the
Restructuring identified as the "Kykloud and BlueCielo Group Restructuring" on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto prior to the Securities Purchase Closing and (b)
take all commercially reasonable actions within its control to implement the
remaining steps of the Restructuring and use commercially reasonable efforts
to consummate such remaining steps, in each case, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and prior to the Securities Purchase Closing, it being
understood and agreed that the failure to consummate any portion of the
Restructuring referred to in clause _(b)_ shall not, in and of itself,
constitute or give rise to the failure of a condition to the Securities
Purchase Closing or the Merger Closing. The Company shall (i) keep the Parent
reasonably informed on a regular and current basis (including through update
calls held on a weekly basis or otherwise as the Parent may reasonably
request) of the status of the Restructuring, (ii) provide the Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of all relevant
documents and filings in connection with the Restructuring, and (iii) provide
such other information in connection with the Restructuring as the Parent
may reasonably request. If the Company determines that the completion of any
step of the Restructuring is limited or restricted or may be materially
delayed, then the Company shall promptly notify the Parent and shall
reasonably cooperate and consult with the Parent in good faith to remove any
such limitation or restriction or avoid such delay (including, as and to the
extent reasonably agreed by the Parent and the Company, modifying the
Restructuring in a manner that is reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the
Company). The Company shall promptly notify the Parent in writing following
the completion of any steps of the Restructuring described in _Section_ __ _
6.04(b)_ to the extent completed prior to the Securities Purchase Closing and
shall provide the Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Parent
of such completion.

 

6.05 _Exclusive Dealing_. Except in connection with any issuance of shares
of Common Stock pursuant to a Vested Option or any other issuance permitted
under _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, neither the Company nor the Seller Representative
shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall direct its and
their respective Representatives not to, take any action to knowingly
initiate, solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations or enter into any
understanding or agreement with, or knowingly provide any information to, any
Person (other than the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Parents
Representatives) concerning any purchase of any outstanding Common Stock or
any merger, sale or contribution of any material assets of the Group
Companies (directly or indirectly), recapitalization or other similar
transactions involving the Group Companies (other than assets

 



42

    

 sold in the ordinary course of business and as otherwise permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_) (each such transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
");  _provided_ that this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ shall not apply to the
Company or the Seller Representative in connection with Securityholder
communications related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and direct its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any Person
(other than the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Parents Representatives)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, including
the termination of any online data room access to any such Person. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person (other than
the Parent) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of an Acquisition Transaction to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such
Person in connection therewith.

6.06 _Payoff Letters and Lien Releases_. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
deliver notices of prepayment within the time periods require by the
relevant agreements governing Indebtedness outstanding under the agreements
governing Indebtedness of the type referred to in clause _(a)_ of the
definition of Indebtedness, and (b) arrange for the Payoff Letters and
customary lien releases and instruments of termination or discharge to be
delivered to Parent no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date (with drafts being delivered in advance as may be reasonably requested by
the Parent) and provide any other necessary notices, in each case, to allow
for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the Closing Date of all
Indebtedness outstanding under the agreements governing Indebtedness of the
type referred to in clause _(a)_ of the definition of Indebtedness (and the
release of all Liens thereunder).

6.07 _Written Consent_. Promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after the date
hereof), the Company shall deliver to the Parent the Written Consent. The
Company shall, in accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL,
distribute an information statement and the notice required under Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof to each of the Common Stockholders who have not executed the Written
Consent. 

6.08 _Section_ __ _ 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each Person (each, a "
_Disqualified Individual_ ") to whom any payment or benefit is required or
proposed to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that could constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Section_ __ _
280G_ _Payments_ ") a written agreement (a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ ")
waiving such Disqualified Individuals right to receive some or all of such
payment or benefit (the " _Waived Benefits_ "), to the extent necessary so
that all remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Disqualified
Individual shall not be deemed a parachute payment, and accepting in
substitution for the Waived Benefits the right to receive the Waived Benefits
only if approved by the stockholders of the Company in a manner that complies
with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. In connection with the foregoing, the
Parent shall provide the Company with all information reasonably necessary to
allow the Company to determine whether any payments made or to be made or
benefits granted or to be granted pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
contract entered into or negotiated by the

 



43

    

 Parent or its Affiliates (the " _Parent Payments_ "), together with all
Section 280G Payments, could reasonably be considered to be "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code at least seven
(7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or promptly after such amounts are
known, if later, but in any event not fewer than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date (and shall further provide any such updated information
as is reasonably necessary prior to the Closing Date). Prior to the Securities
Purchase Closing, the Company shall submit the Waived Benefits of each
Disqualified Individual who has executed a Parachute Payment Waiver in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ for approval of the Companys
stockholders and such Disqualified Individuals right to receive the Waived
Benefits shall be conditioned upon receipt of the requisite approval by the
Companys stockholders in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided_ , that in no
event shall this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ be construed to require the Company
(or any of its Affiliates) to compel any Disqualified Individual to waive any
existing rights under any Contract or agreement that such Disqualified
Individual has with the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
Person, and in no event shall the Company (or any of its Affiliates) be deemed
in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ if any such Disqualified Individual
refuses to waive any such rights despite the Companys commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a Parachute Payment Waiver from such Disqualified
Individual or if the stockholders fail to approve any Waived Benefits.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ or
otherwise in this Agreement, to the extent the Parent has provided materially
inaccurate information, or the Parents material omission of information has
resulted in materially inaccurate information, with respect to any Parent
Payments, there shall be no breach of the covenant contained herein or the
representations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.18(d)(iv)_ to the extent caused
by such inaccurate or omitted information. Prior to obtaining the Parachute
Payment Waivers and seeking the stockholder approval described in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.08_, the Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel
with copies of the analysis under Section 280G of the Code, the Parachute
Payment Waivers and the disclosure statement and other stockholder approval
materials contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ and at least three (3)
Business Days to review and the Company shall consider in good faith any
changes reasonably requested by the Parent or its counsel.

6.09 _Resignations; Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. At the
direction of the Parent, which written direction shall be delivered by the
Parent to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) obtain the
resignation or removal of any director, officer, manager or equivalent of each
Group Company, in each case, effective as of the Effective Time as so
designated in writing by the Parent, and (b) deliver to the Parent, prior to
the Securities Purchase Closing, documentation reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent evidencing such resignation or removal. The Company shall (i)
terminate, as of the Securities Purchase Closing, each Affiliate Transaction
set forth on _Schedule C_ without any further Liabilities on the part of any
Group Company and (ii) deliver to the Parent, prior to the Securities Purchase
Closing, documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Parent evidencing the
termination of such Affiliate Transactions. In the event any Related Party
Financing exists or is found to exist after the date hereof, the Company shall
(A) cause all such Related Party Financing to be repaid, eliminated and
discharged at least twenty four (24) hours prior to the Closing Date, and (B)
deliver to the Parent, prior to the Securities Purchase Closing, documentation
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent evidencing such repayment, elimination
and discharge.

 



44

    

6.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Securities Purchase Closing, Parent, the Company,
and the Seller Representative shall cooperate fully and in good faith, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with any
Tax matters contemplated by this Agreement. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant, as well as making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, and the
Seller Representative further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any Taxes
discussed in _Section_ __ _ 11.03_).

 

(b) For a period of at least one (1) Business Day following the date of the
Merger Closing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
included in the Parent Guarantors affiliated group, as such term is defined
in Section 1504(a) of the Code. For federal income Tax purposes and applicable
state income Tax purposes, the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not end on the date of the Merger Closing.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 

7.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Effective Time
until the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide the Seller Representative and
its authorized Representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining and copying at the Seller Representatives own cost), during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the books and records which the
Group Companies possess as of the Effective Time with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date to the extent reasonably related
to any Tax audits, Tax Returns, insurance claims, governmental investigations,
legal compliance, financial statement preparation or any other similar matter
arising from the Common Stockholders ownership of the Company prior to
the Merger Closing. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller
Representative, the Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, for a period of six (6) years following
the Closing Date, destroy or delete any of the books and records of any Group
Company for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior notice to the Seller Representative and offering to surrender
to the Seller Representative a copy of such books and records or any portion
thereof which the Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
intend to destroy or delete. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the disclosure of information contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_ shall not be required if (i) it would require Parent or
any Group Company to disclose information which Parent has reasonably
determined upon the advice of counsel could result in the loss of the ability
to successfully assert attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product
privilege, conflict with any third party confidentiality obligations to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is bound, or would violate any
applicable Law, _provided_ , that the Parent and the Group Companies shall
reasonably cooperate in good faith to enable the Seller Representative to have
permissible access to such

 



45

    

 information in a manner that would not result in loss of such privilege,
conflict with such confidentiality obligations or violation of the Law, and in
the case of confidentiality obligations to a third party, shall request the
consent of the applicable third party to permit such disclosure, in each case,
at the Seller Representatives sole cost and expense, or (ii) the Parent, the
Group Companies or any of its or their respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Seller Representative, any Securityholder or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in any Action
and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto. Any access to
books, records or personnel of the Group Companies by the Seller
Representative in connection with the Closing Statement or any dispute thereof
shall be exclusively governed by _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.

 

7.02 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Group Companies_.

 

(a) From and after the Merger Closing, the Parent shall cause each Group
Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Merger Closing, an officer, limited
liability company manager or director of any Group Company (each, a " _D andO
Indemnified Party_"), against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
Liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, Action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
Person was an officer, limited liability company manager or director of such
Group Company to the extent pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or
any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 13.11_) to the same extent that such Person is
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date hereof
by such Group Company pursuant to its respective Organizational Documents and
applicable Law, and pursuant to the indemnification agreements identified on
_Schedule 4.22_ , if any, in existence on the date hereof with such Person.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time and at all times
subject to applicable Law, (i) the Parent shall not (and shall not cause or
permit any Group Company or any of the Parents other Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to) amend or modify in any way adverse to the DandO Indemnified
Parties, or to the beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation and indemnification
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Group Companies or
any of the Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (ii) the Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Group
Companies as of the date hereof with respect to claims arising from the fact
that such Person was an officer or director of the Company to the extent
pertaining to facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Merger Closing;
_provided_ that the Parent may substitute such policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are no less advantageous in the aggregate to the DandO
Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time and in satisfaction of the Parents foregoing obligations under clause
(ii) of the prior sentence, the Company shall purchase (at the Companys
expense) a six (6) year "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability
insurance policy (" _D andO Tail_"), effective as of the Merger Closing,
providing, for a period of six (6) years after the Merger Closing, the
coverage and amounts, and terms and conditions, contemplated by the foregoing
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_. From and after the Merger Closing,
the Parent shall

 



46

    

 (and/or shall cause the Group Companies or its other Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as applicable, to) continue to honor its obligations under any
such insurance procured pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, and shall
not cancel (or permit to be canceled) or take (or cause to be taken) any
action or omission that would reasonably be expected to result in the
cancellation thereof.

 

(c) The Parent agrees to cause each Group Company to pay, to the same
extent permitted by such Group Companys Organizational Documents as of the
date hereof and applicable Law, all expenses, including attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any advancement of expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.02(c)_ shall be conditioned upon the applicable Group Companys receipt of a
customary undertaking by or on behalf of the DandO Indemnified Party to repay
such amount if it shall be ultimately determined by final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that the DandO Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_.

(d) If the Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns proposes to (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and the Parent or the Surviving Company shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made prior to or
concurrently with the consummation of such transaction so that the successors
and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
shall, from and after the consummation of such transaction, honor the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_.

 

(e) With respect to any indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.02(a)_, the Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Group
Companies shall be the indemnitors of first resort with respect to all
indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ ( _i.e._ ,
their obligations to an applicable DandO Indemnified Party are primary and any
obligation of any other Person to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification and/or insurance for the same expenses or Liabilities incurred
by such DandO Indemnified Party are secondary).

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time and (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs and Representatives and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Parent and the Surviving Company and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

 

7.03 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent and the Company shall promptly (and, with respect to
the filings and submissions under the HSR Act, in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) after the date hereof, make or cause to be made all filings and
submissions under the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (which filings and
submissions shall seek early termination if made pursuant to the HSR Act and
the equivalent, if available, with respect to any such other applicable Laws).
Prior to execution of the BlueCielo Purchase Agreement, neither the Parent
nor the Company shall, or shall

 



47

    

 permit any of its Affiliates to, make or cause to be made any filings or
submissions with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transfer of
BlueCielo RUS without the prior written consent of the other Party. In
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, each
of the Parent and the Company shall promptly comply with any additional
requests for information, including requests for production of documents and
production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any Governmental
Entities. Subject to limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, each
of the Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with
any Governmental Entities and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Merger and to cause the condition set forth in _Sections
8.01(d)_ and _8.01(f)_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, and
undertake any and all action required to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Outside Date and lawfully;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to, nor shall
the Company, the Seller Representative or any of their respective Affiliates,
without the prior written consent of the Parent, agree to or proffer to,
divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or similar agreement
with respect to, or agree to any undertaking to restrict the ownership or
operation of, or agree to conduct or operate in a specified manner, any
portion of the Companys business, the Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 

(b) The Parent and the Company shall diligently assist and cooperate with
each other in preparing and filing any and all written communications that
are to be submitted to any Governmental Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in obtaining termination or expiration of
the waiting period under the HSR Act or any governmental or third party
consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals which may be required to be
obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which
assistance and cooperation shall include: (i) promptly providing the other
Party with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Entity relating to any notification under the HSR Act or any required consent,
waiver, authorization or approval; _provided_ that such copies may be redacted
as necessary to address legal privilege or confidentiality concerns or to
comply with applicable Law; _provided_ , ___further_ , that portions of such
copies that are competitively sensitive may be designated as "outside
antitrust counsel only"; (ii) keeping the other Party reasonably informed of
any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by the
first Party, in each case, regarding the Merger; and (iii) permitting the
other Party to review and consider in good faith the other Partys reasonable
comments in any communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or in
connection with any proceeding related to the HSR Act or other applicable Law,
in each case regarding the Merger. Neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub, on
the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall initiate, or
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity with
respect to any filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry
regarding the Merger or filings under the HSR Act or other applicable Law
without giving the other Party(ies) reasonable prior notice of the meeting or
discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity
and applicable Law, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or discussion. All filing fees under the HSR Act and under any other
applicable Laws shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and fifty
percent (50%) by the Participating Securityholders.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in timely providing
all assurances, communications, notices, disclosures and submissions required
or contemplated by or otherwise made pursuant to the National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual or other applicable national security
directives, forms and instructions issued by the Department of

 



48

    

 Defense, Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ "), other applicable Cognizant
Security Agency as designated by a customer with respect to a Government
Contract (" _CSA_ "), or any applicable Governmental Entity under the
Investment Canada Act, or as otherwise requested by DSS or such other
Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub and support and facilitate all such
communications and submissions regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including but not limited to a notice to DSS or CSA or any other
applicable Governmental Entity of the transaction upon the signing of this
Agreement).

7.04 _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but
not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ ). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.04_ shall limit, expand or otherwise modify in any way any efforts standard
explicitly applicable to any of the Parents and/or the Merger Subs
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.05 _Contacts with Customers, Suppliers_ _and Others_. The Parent and the
Merger Sub each hereby agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing
Date or the earlier termination of the Agreement, it is not authorized to, and
shall not (and shall not permit any of its Representatives or Affiliates to),
directly or indirectly, contact and communicate with the employees,
consultants, directors, officers shareholders, members, investors, suppliers
or customers of any Group Company, in each case, without the prior
consultation with, and written approval of, the Companys Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer or the Seller Representative (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall not prohibit any such
contacts or communications by the Parent or the Parents Representatives in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, solely to the
extent that (a) such contacts are unrelated to the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Group Companies, the Confidential Information and/or the fact
that the Company is pursuing a transaction, and (b) none of the foregoing is
directly or indirectly disclosed, discussed, identified or referenced in
connection with such contact or communication.

7.06 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the
twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), the Parent will provide, or will cause the Group Companies to
provide, each Company Employee with (i) base salary or base hourly wage rate
and annual cash based incentive compensation opportunities (other than
deferred compensation, equity or equity-based compensation) that,
collectively, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary or
base hourly wage rate and annual cash based incentive compensation
opportunities (other than deferred compensation, equity or equity-based
compensation) provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) employee benefits (other than any defined benefit
plans, retiree medical plans, long-term incentive plans and equity based
compensation plans) that are substantially similar in the aggregate

 



49

    

 to those benefits provided by the Parent and its Affiliates to similarly-
situated employees of the Parent and its Affiliates. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parent will provide, or will cause the Group
Companies to provide, severance pay to any Company Employee whose employment
is terminated by the Parent or the Group Companies during the Continuation
Period on terms and in amounts no less favorable than the severance pay that
would have been applicable to such Company Employee under the Company Plans
set forth on _Schedule D_ , in each case, unless the Parent or any Group
Company otherwise agrees with such Company Employee.

 

(b) The Parent will, and will cause the Group Companies to, grant all
Company Employees full credit for all service with the Group Companies (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Group Companies provide such past
service credit) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and, with respect to paid time off or severance benefits only
the determination of benefit accrual or determining the level benefits under
any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy or agreement made available
to Company Employees (other than any equity based compensation plan or long-
term incentive plan) on or after the Closing Date occurs (collectively, the "
_New Plans_ ") to the same extent such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Closing Date by the Group Companies under a corresponding Company
Plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that under no circumstance shall any employee
receive credit for service to the extent such recognition would result in the
duplication of compensation or benefits. In addition, the Parent will, and
will cause the Group Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work
requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any New Plans that provide health benefits
(other than any long-term disability plan) in which Company Employees commence
participation during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to the
extent such exclusions, requirements or limitations were waived or satisfied
by a Company Employee under any Company Plan providing health benefits in
which the Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Merger
Closing, and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by any Company Employee (or covered dependent thereof) prior to
the Closing Date under a Company Plan that provides health benefits during
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions under any New Plan that provides health benefits for
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. To the extent reflected in the
calculation of Closing Merger Consideration or otherwise accrued on the
Financial Statements, Parent will, or will cause the Group Companies to, honor
all accrued but unused vacation, paid-time off, personal and sick days of
Company Employees as of the Closing Date.

(c) Effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
and contingent upon the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary
to (i) terminate any and all Company Plans (including the adoption of
resolutions by the board of directors of the employer sponsoring such Company
Plan(s) in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) intended to qualify as
qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code (the
" _Company 401(k) Plans_ ") and (ii) one hundred percent (100%) vest all
participants in their account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan(s).
Effective on or as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing
Date, each Company Employee was a participant in a Company 401(k) Plan (each,
a " _Company 401(k) Participant_ ") shall be allowed to participate in a
qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code that
is sponsored and maintained by Parent or one 

 



50

    

 of its Affiliates (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause or permit, as
applicable, the account balances of each Company 401(k) Participant in the
Company 401(k) Plan(s) to be distributed in accordance with the terms of such
plan, and the Parent shall permit or cause an Affiliate of the Parent to
permit the Company 401(k) Participants who are participants in such plan to
roll over any such distributions into the Parent 401(k) Plan in accordance
with the terms of such plan and applicable law. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (but in any event prior to the distributions and
rollovers described in the previous sentence), the Company shall make pro-
rated employer contributions to the Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of each
eligible Company 401(k) Participant in an amount as determined under the
terms of such Company 401(k) Plan for the plan year or portion thereof ending
on the Closing Date (to the extent such amounts have not previously been
contributed to such employees accounts), but disregarding any end-of-quarter,
end-of-year or other service requirement to receive such contributions.

Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates from
amending, modifying or terminating any benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them, or (iii) will constitute an amendment
to or any other modification of any New Plan or Company Plan or other benefit
or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement.
Further, this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ will be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.06_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever (including any
third-party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this _Section_ __ _
7.06_.

 

7.07 _Release_. Effective as of the Merger Closing, each of the Group
Companies, and their respective successors and assigns (the " _Company
Parties_ " ), hereby fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever
discharges each holder of Common Stock, and their respective former, current
and future equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives, members, managers, general or limited

collectively, the " _Sponsor Parties_ "), and each of the Sponsor Parties
hereby fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the
Company Parties, from any and all manner of actions, causes of actions,
claims, obligations, demands, damages, costs, expenses, compensation or other

Parties operation of the Group Companies or ownership of the Common Stock, in
each case, prior to the Merger Closing, except, for any claims or causes of
action in connection with fraud; ___provided_ that nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.07_ shall be construed as a release with respect to
any employment and related agreements for individuals, any Claims arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder or any other
Claims that may arise between the Parent (or any of its Affiliates), on the
one hand, and any Sponsor Party, on the other hand, unrelated to the Group
Companies or the transactions contemplated hereunder.

delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Effective Time for a period of,
and expire upon the date that is, twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
(b) all other representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto and all covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with prior to

(c) all covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall expire
and terminate at the Effective Time other than covenants and other agreements
contained in this Agreement which by their terms contemplate performance after
the Effective Time, which shall survive the Effective Time for the period
contemplated by their respective terms. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or reduce any
Persons ability to make a claim for Actual Fraud. The period for which a
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement survives the Effective Time
is referred to herein as the " _Applicable Survival Period_." No claim for
indemnification hereunder may be made after the expiration of the Applicable
Survival Period; _provided_ , that in the event notice of claim for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ is given
within the Applicable Survival Period (and with reasonable specificity in
light of the circumstances) in accordance with the provisions of this Article
VIII and such claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such
Applicable Survival Period, the representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement that is the subject of such indemnification claim shall survive
with respect to such claim only until such claim is finally resolved.

9.02 _Indemnification by the _ _Participating Securityholders_. Subject
to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the Merger Closing, the
Participating Securityholders shall, severally and not jointly and based on
their respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify and defend the Parent and its
Affiliates and its and their respective stockholders, members, managers,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Parent
Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold the Parent Indemnitees harmless from,
any Losses incurred or sustained by any Parent Indemnitee in connection with,
or otherwise arising from, (a) any breach of any Company Fundamental
Representation, (b) any breach of any other representation or warranty of the
Company, in each case, contained in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) any breach prior to the Effective Time of
any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement
(other than _S_ _ecti_ _on_ __ _ 6.04_).

9.03 _Indemnification by_ _the Parent_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, from and after the Merger
Closing, the Parent shall indemnify and defend the Common Stockholders and
their respective Affiliates and stockholders, members, managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors

 



55

    

 and assigns (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold the
Seller Indemnitees harmless from, any Loss incurred or sustained by any Seller
Indemnitees in connection with, or otherwise arising from, (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or (ii) any
covenant or agreement of the Parent or the Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement.

(b) The Parent shall indemnify and defend the Company, the other
Group Companies, the Common Stockholders and their respective Affiliates and
stockholders, members, managers, officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold
the Company Indemnitees harmless from, any Loss incurred or sustained by any
of the Company Indemnitees in connection with, or otherwise arising from, (i)
the Securities Purchase or (ii) the Restructuring; _provided_ that (x) the
Parent shall not have any indemnification obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 9.03(b)_ to the extent the Loss arose out of, as a result of, or in
connection with, the failure by the Company to conduct the Restructuring (or
any step thereof) in accordance with _Schedule_ __ _ A_ (or any
modifications as may be agreed by the Company and the Parent), and (y) without
limiting clause _ (x)_, the Parent shall only have indemnification
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ to the extent the Loss would
not have otherwise arisen as a result of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Securities Purchase or any of
the steps undertaken in accordance with the Restructuring). The amount of any
Loss otherwise indemnifiable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ shall
be equitably reduced by the amount of any current or future Tax or other
benefit available to the Company Indemnitees as a result of the Restructuring
and the Securities Purchase, but only to the extent agreed by the Seller
Representative in good faith. The indemnification obligations of Parent under
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ shall be effective regardless of whether the
Securities Purchase Closing or Merger Closing occurs and, if this Agreement is
terminated, shall survive any termination of this Agreement other than
in circumstances in which the Parent is entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.01(c)_.

 

9.04 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
second sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, (i) no Participating
Securityholder shall be liable for any Loss pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_
unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses (excluding any individual
Loss that is subject to and less than the Per Claim Threshold) incurred by
the Parent Indemnitees exceeds $7,500,000.00 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then
only to the extent of the amount of such Losses that exceed the Deductible,
and (ii) no Participating Securityholder shall be liable for any individual
Loss pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ unless and until the aggregate amount
of such Loss exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), in each case
of clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , other than with respect to (x) an Actual Fraud
or (y) any breach of any Company Fundamental Representation.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
second sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, the maximum cumulative obligation
of the Participating Securityholders under this _Article IX_ (other than with
respect to any breach of any Company Fundamental Representation) shall in no
event exceed $7,500,000.00 (the " _Cap_ ") and without limiting any of the
foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which a
Participating Securityholder is obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees
under this _Article IX_ exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration actually
received by such Participating Securityholder, in each case, other than with
respect to an Actual Fraud.

 



56

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, (i) the Parent shall not be liable
for any Loss pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Losses (excluding any individual Loss that is
subject to and less than the Per Claim Threshold) incurred by the Seller
Indemnitees exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of the amount
of such Losses that exceed the Deductible, and (ii) the Parent shall not
be liable for any individual Loss pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ unless
and until the aggregate amount of such Loss exceeds the Per Claim Threshold,
in each case of clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , other than with respect to (x) an
Actual Fraud or (y) any breach of any Parent Fundamental Representation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, the maximum cumulative obligation of
the Parent under _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_ (other than with respect to any
breach of any Parent Fundamental Representation) shall in no event exceed the
Cap, and without limiting any of the foregoing, in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Losses for which the Parent is obligated to indemnify the
Seller Indemnitees under this  _Article IX_ exceed the Base Consideration, in
each case, other than with respect to an Actual Fraud.

(e) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses that are the
subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder and for purposes of
determining whether or not a breach of any representation or warranty has
occurred, each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be read without regard
and without giving effect to any qualifiers or exceptions as to "materiality,"
"Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect," or other similar
qualifications contained in or applicable to such representations and
warranties, other than with respect to _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_, the term
"Company Material Contract" or the term "Material Government Contract".

(f) Parent will cause the Group Companies to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not include any obligation to
litigate or participate in any arbitration or similar proceedings) to obtain
reimbursement for Losses for which any Parent Indemnitee is
seeking indemnification hereunder under (i) each available insurance policy
of the Group Companies (other than the RandW Insurance Policy) under which
coverage may reasonably be obtained and (ii) the agreements listed in
_Schedule E_ to the extent that, at the time that the Parent Indemnitee is
seeking reimbursement, the applicable agreement provides ongoing and valid
recourse against the applicable sellers which are Persons with credit-
worthiness sufficient to indemnify the applicable Losses; _provided_ that,
for clause _(i)_ , the applicable Common Stockholders or their respective
Affiliates shall provide reasonable assistance to the extent required to
enforce such insurance policies (it being agreed that such assistance shall
be limited to responding to requests regarding knowledge such Common
Stockholders or Affiliates may have had that would impact Parents ability to
recovery under such insurance policies); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
obtaining such reimbursement shall not be a condition to the Indemnitee
receiving indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_. The amount of Losses
payable under this _Article IX_ by the Indemnitor shall be reduced by any
and all amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable
insurance policies (other than the RandW Insurance Policy) or from any other
Person responsible therefor, net of any costs, expenses or premiums (including
increases in premiums) 

 



57

    

 incurred by Parent or any Group Company pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.04(f)_. The Parent agrees that the RandW Insurance Policy
will expressly exclude any right of subrogation against the Securityholders
and their Affiliates under this Agreement, except in the case of Actual Fraud.
If the Indemnitee receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies
(other than the RandW Insurance Policy) or from any other Person responsible
for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnitor,
then such Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment
made by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such indemnification up
to the amount actually received by the Indemnitee, net of any costs, expenses
or premiums (including increases in premiums) incurred by such Indemnitee in
collecting such amount. For purposes of avoiding double recovery, no
Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_
with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged
Loss was included in the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Net
Working Capital or Transaction Expenses in calculating the Final Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.10_, _Section_ __ _ 1.11_
or _Section_ __ _ 1.12_.

 

9.05 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state
of facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which an
Indemnitor may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted or sought to
be collected by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee
shall as soon as practicable notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third
Party Claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ "). Failure or delay in notifying the
Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any Liability it may have to the
Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or delay causes
actual harm to the Indemnitor with respect to such Third Party Claim. The
Notice of Claim shall specify in reasonable detail the amount or the estimated
amount of such Losses to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall
not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim), the basis
for any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, breach of covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the
applicable Sections of this Agreement with respect thereto), or other claim
to which such Losses are related. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Notice
of Claim a copy of all material papers served on the Indemnitee with respect
to such Third Party Claim, if any.

 

(b) The Indemnitor will be entitled to, by written notice to the Indemnitee
delivered within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of a Notice of Claim,
defend or prosecute such Third Party Claim and any Action resulting therefrom
(a " _Third Party Defense_ ") with counsel of its choice (subject to approval
by the Indemnitee which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), at the cost and expense of the Indemnitor (or, if it is
finally determined that the Indemnitee incurred a Loss with respect to the
matter in question for which the Indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ or _9.03_ , as
applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitee) upon delivery of notice to such
effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall keep
the Indemnitee reasonably informed on a regular and current basis of the
progress of such defense and prosecution and provide the Indemnitee with
copies of all relevant documents and such other information as the Indemnitee
may reasonably request in relation to such defense and prosecution; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense, but the
Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof
(provided, that the counsel retained by the Indemnitee to participate in such
defense shall not be the counsel of record and shall not

 



58

    

 communicate with the Person or Persons asserting the Third Party Claim, or
any Representatives thereof, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor). The Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the control of
(and, if Seller Representative has assumed control, shall transfer to the
Indemnitee the control of) a Third Party Defense if such Third Party Defense
(i) relates to any criminal Action, (ii) seeks an injunction or equitable
relief as a remedy against the Indemnitor, (iii) involves Losses reasonably
estimated to exceed the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which the
Indemnitor could be responsible to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to such
Third Party Claim after applying any limitations set forth in _Article IX_
and accounting for any other claims that have been made or satisfied; (iv)
involves a conflict of interest, which exists or would reasonably be expected
to arise in the event the Indemnitor elects to control or defend any Third
Party Claim, (v) involves a dispute with a material customer or vendor of any
Group Company or its Affiliates, or (vi) at the time of assumption of such
defense or prosecution or thereafter, the Indemnitor fails to conduct the
investigation, defense or prosecution reasonably diligently. If the Indemnitor
chooses to assume control of any Third Party Defense, the Indemnitee shall (at
the Indemnitors cost) reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and
settlement of such Third Party Defense, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to (x) procure witnesses under the Indemnitees control and
related witness statements, (y) promptly furnish documentary evidence to the
extent in its or its Representatives possession, and (z) provide access to
any other relevant documents or party, including any Representatives, in each
case of clauses  _(x)_ to _(z)_ , (A) to the extent reasonably related to
such Third Party Defense and (B) the Indemnitor and its Representatives (as
applicable) shall agree to keep all such information confidential and to use
it only for the purpose of defending or prosecuting the Third Party Claim.
The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle
or compromise, or consent to the entry of judgment in respect of, any Third
Party Defense that the Indemnitor has assumed the control of, in each case,
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment does not involve any finding or
admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor obtains, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnitee from any liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not timely elect to control a Third Party
Defense or is not permitted to do so under  _Section_ __ _ 9.05(b)_, the
Indemnitee shall control the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Defense and any Action resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice (subject
to approval by the Indemnitor which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, it being understood that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP shall be deemed an approved counsel), at the cost and expense of the
Indemnitor subject to the limitations set forth in _Article IX_  (or, if it
is finally determined that the Indemnitee incurred a Loss with respect to the
matter in question for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ or _9.03_ , as applicable, at the cost and
expense of the Indemnitee for the portion of the costs and expenses equitably
allocated to such matter) upon delivery of notice to such effect to the

right to participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense,
but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and settlement
thereof; and (ii) the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent

to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of
the final amount of such Third Party Claim), the basis for any anticipated
liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach
of covenant or agreement set forth herein (including the applicable Sections
of this Agreement with respect thereto), or other claim to which such Losses

by any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to any claim notice submitted in
accordance with this _Article IX_ , not fully resolved prior to the time of

Parent Indemnitee, the excess funds in the Escrow Account shall be released in
the same manner provided in the preceding sentence, _mutatis mutandis_.

to the Seller Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, upon and by virtue
of the Stockholder Approval or acceptance of any consideration pursuant to
this Agreement, all of the Securityholders collectively and irrevocably
constitute and appoint the Seller Representative, as their agent and

 upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Seller Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon
the Securityholders. The Parent and the Surviving Company are entitled to deal
exclusively with the Seller Representative on all matters relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. Any action
taken or not taken, or decisions, communications or writings made, given or
executed by the Seller Representative shall be deemed an action taken or not

their behalf. In such event, each Securityholder shall vote in accordance with
the pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration paid to such Securityholder

the authorization of the Securityholders. The appointment of the
Seller Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by
any Securityholder in any manner or for any reason. This authority granted to
the Seller Representative shall not be affected by the death, illness,
dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to act of any
principal pursuant to any applicable Law. Genstar Capital VII, L.P. hereby
accepts its appointment as the initial Seller Representative.

 

(c) _Resignation; Vacancies_. The Seller Representative may resign from

in its capacity as such, shall not have any personal liability for any amount
owed to the Parent pursuant to this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _
1.11_ or _Section_ __ _ 1.12_. The Seller Representative, in its capacity as

for any personal liability of a Securityholder or otherwise, or for anything
which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement. The

in his or its capacity as the Seller Representative, for any personal
liability of a Securityholder or otherwise, or for any

 



64

    

 error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good
faith, or for any mistake in fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or
refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement, except in the case of
the Seller Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Seller Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel
in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or its duties or rights hereunder, and it shall
incur no personal liability in its capacity as the Seller Representative to
the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Securityholders and shall be
fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in
good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Seller
Representative shall not by reason of this Agreement have a fiduciary

received on behalf of the Securityholders.

 

(e) _Indemnification; Expenses_. The Seller Representative may use the
Seller Representative Amount to pay any fees, costs, expenses or other
obligations incurred by the Seller Representative acting in its capacity as
such. Without limiting the foregoing, each Participating Securityholder shall,
only to the extent of such Participating Securityholders Pro Rata Share
thereof, indemnify and defend the Seller Representative and hold the Seller
Representative harmless against any loss, damage, cost, Liability or expense
actually incurred without fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Seller Representative (as determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the Seller
Representatives duties under this Agreement. Any expenses or taxable income
incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with the performance of
its duties under this Agreement shall not be the personal obligation of the
Seller Representative but shall be payable by and attributable to the
Participating Securityholders based on each such Participating
Securityholders Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Seller Representative shall be entitled and is hereby
granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid or non-reimbursed expenses
and unsatisfied Liabilities incurred by the Seller Representative in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder from amounts actually
delivered to the Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement.
Additionally, in connection with any unpaid or non-reimbursed expenses
and unsatisfied Liabilities incurred by the Seller Representative in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, the Seller
Representative shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right to direct any
funds that would otherwise be actually payable to the Participating
Securityholders from the Escrow Account to itself no earlier than the date
such payments are actually made. The Seller Representative may also from time
to time submit invoices to the Participating Securityholders covering such
expenses and Liabilities, which shall be paid by the Participating
Securityholders promptly following the receipt thereof based on their
respective Pro Rata Share. Upon the request of any Participating
Securityholder, the Seller Representative shall provide such Participating
Securityholder with an accounting of all expenses and Liabilities paid by the
Seller Representative in its capacity as such.

of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire
Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have

65

    

 purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to the
sections of this Agreement; however, any item disclosed in any part, subpart,
Section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule referenced by a particular
Section or subsection in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other Section and subsection in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the omission of an
appropriate cross-reference. Any item of information, matter or document
disclosed or referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure Schedules shall
not (a) necessarily represent a determination by the Company that any item is
or has "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement or to establish a standard of materiality, (b)
necessarily represent a determination by the Company that such item or matter
did not arise in the ordinary course of business, (c) be deemed or interpreted

party, (f) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission to any third
party concerning such item or matter or (g) constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, an admission or indication by the Company, the Parent or the
Merger Sub that such item meets any or all of the criteria set forth in this
Agreement for inclusion in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any
agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Capitalized terms

meanings given to them in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Group Companies, the
Securityholders, any Affiliate thereof or any other Person is making any
representation or warranty regarding the Restructuring and/or the Securities
Purchase and/or any transaction undertaken solely with respect thereto; for
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be deemed to have
breached any representation or warranty in _Article IV_ as a result of the
failure to include on any Disclosure Schedule any item or matter that has
arisen solely as a result of or solely in connection with the
Restructuring or the Securities Purchase (including, without limitation, any
entity formed, agreement entered into, filing made or consent required with
respect thereto) and would not have otherwise arisen as a result of the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the
Securities Purchase or any of the steps undertaken in accordance with the
Restructuring).

(a) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees

the related Tax Returns and other documentation described in the following
sentence) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Participating Securityholders. All such Taxes, fees and
charges shall be paid by the Parent when due and the Parent shall file all

fees and charges; _provided_ , that the Seller Representative shall cooperate

Securities Purchase (and the costs of preparing the related Tax Returns and
other documentation described in the following sentence) shall be borne solely
by the Parent, to the extent such Transfer Taxes would not have otherwise been
incurred pursuant to the Merger. All such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the
Parent when due and the Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges; _provided_ ,
that the Seller Representative shall cooperate in good faith in connection
with the preparation of such Tax Returns and other documentation.

13.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by the Company, the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Seller
Representative without the prior written consent of the non-assigning Parties;
_provided_ , that, without the consent of any of the other Parties, Parent
may assign or transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates.

 

13.06 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 

13.07 _References_. The table of contents and the Section and other
headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto
are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
Parties, and shall not in any way affect the meaning

 



86

    

 or interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to
days (excluding Business Days) or months shall be deemed references to
calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be deemed references to
United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to
a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to
refer to a Section of this Agreement, an exhibit to this Agreement or a
Schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "including" or any variation thereof means "including,
without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement
that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately
following it. Unless the context requires otherwise, words in this Agreement
using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively, and the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to
include the other genders. The words "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and shall not simply mean "if". The
term "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or." When
calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which,
any act is to be done or step taken under this Agreement, the date that is
the reference date in calculating such period will be excluded. If the last
day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question will end on
the next succeeding Business Day. The words "shall" and "will" shall be
construed as creating a mandatory obligation. Any Contract or Law referred to
herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented. The words "made available", "provided", "disclosed to the
Parent" or similar terms in _Article IV_ means, with respect to a particular
document, item or other piece of information, inclusion and availability to
Parent and its Representatives in the virtual data room hosted by Merrill
Corporation in connection with the Merger on or prior to 11:59 p.m. New York
time on July 29, 2018.

 

13.08 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto does not necessarily represent a
determination by the Company that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or
the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits alone in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is nor is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in
this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained

party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract).

 the Merger Closing) and the Seller Representative, and (b) in the case of a
waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving rights hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any amendment
to this Agreement which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders
of the Company shall be subject to such further approval by such stockholders.
No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent

Paying Agent Agreement, the Release and Support Agreements, any Option
Cancellation Agreements, the Warrant Cancellation Agreement, any Securities

agreement between the Parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral,
which may have related to such subject matter in any way, including any data
room agreements, bid letters, term sheets, summary issues lists or other
agreements.

 

13.11 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Provisions of this Agreement that
expressly provide for the enforcement by the Seller Representative on behalf
of the Securityholders are intended for the benefit of the Securityholders;

herein to the contrary (including _Section_ __ _ 7.02_), no DandO Indemnified
Party shall have any right to advancement, indemnification, contribution or

TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT

 



88

OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES
TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

 

13.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party or to any such
contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages are executed
and delivered by each of the Company, the Parent, the Merger Sub and the
Seller Representative.

 

13.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than
one (1) Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

 

13.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and any other matters relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

13.16 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, Action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection
with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought
and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware; ___provided_ that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, any such suit, Action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively
in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any other
court of the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, Action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, Action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, Action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, Action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 13.03_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.

 



89

    

13.17 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

13.18 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any action, suit or claim for breach of
this Agreement may only be made against, the Parties to this agreement, and
no Non-Recourse Party of a Party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or, unless otherwise expressly provided in any
Transaction Agreements, any of the transactions contemplated herein.

13.19 _Specific Performance_.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the rights of each Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate
remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that prior to a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, subject to
and without limiting _Section_ __ _ 13.19(b)_, _(c)_ or _(d)_ below
(if applicable), such non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an
Action or Actions for damages but also by an Action or Actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security). Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis
that, and hereby waives any defenses in any Action for an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief that, the other Parties have
an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity and hereby waives any
requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that prior to the proper termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each Party shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause the other Parties to effect the Securities
Purchase Closing and the Merger Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, in each case, if the conditions in _Section_
__ _ 8.01_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_, as applicable, have been satisfied or
waived (other than those to be satisfied at the Securities Purchase Closing,
each of which is capable of being, and is, satisfied or waived upon the
Securities Purchase Closing) at the time when the Securities Purchase Closing
would have occurred pursuant to the terms hereof and remain satisfied or
waived.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of a Partys
right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 13.19_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit such Partys right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and be paid monetary
damages and any other amounts pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that
under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the Securities Purchase
Closing or the Merger Closing occurring and the payment of monetary damages
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.02_.

 



90

    

(d) To the extent the Parent or the Merger Sub brings any Action, claim,
complaint or other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement prior to the Securities Purchase Closing, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action,
claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business
Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such Action, claim, complaint or other proceeding.

13.20 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Irell and Manella LLP
("Irell") has been engaged and has acted as legal counsel to certain of the
Securityholders, the Group Companies and their respective Affiliates prior to
the Merger Closing, and that Irell intends to act as legal counsel to certain
of the Securityholders after the Merger Closing, each of the Parent and the
Surviving Company (including on behalf of the Group Companies) hereby waives,
on its own behalf and agrees to cause their respective Affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with Irell representing any of the
Securityholders and/or their respective Affiliates, in each case after the
Merger Closing, as such representation may relate to the Parent, any Group
Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between any
Securityholders and their respective Affiliates in the course of, and to the
extent relating to, the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to such Securityholders and their respective
Affiliates (and not the Parent and the Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Parent and the Group Companies shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Irell relating to such engagement, whether
or not the Merger Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Merger Closing, (a) the applicable
Securityholders and their respective Affiliates (and not the Parent and the
Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to the engagement of Irell in connection with the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
none of the Parent, the Group Companies or the Surviving Company, (b) to the
extent that files of Irell in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the applicable Securityholders and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Parent and the Group Companies) shall hold
such property rights and (c) Irell shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the extent
relating to such engagement to any of the Parent or the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Irell and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Parent or any of the Group Companies, on the one
hand, and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to disputes arising under this Agreement),
on the other hand, after the Merger Closing, the Surviving Company (including
on behalf of the Group Companies) may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Irell to such
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of the other Group Companies may waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, on behalf of the
Securityholders. 

 



91

    

13.21 _Joint and Several Liability_. Parent 1 and Parent 2 shall be
jointly and severally liable for all obligations, liabilities, agreements,
covenants, representations and warranties of the Parent under this Agreement
and all Transaction Agreements.

 

13.22 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent Guarantor hereby unconditionally
guarantees the due and punctual performance of the payment obligations of the
Parent under this Agreement that are required to be performed at, prior or
after the Merger Closing and any other monetary obligations of the Parent
arising under this Agreement. This guaranty is an irrevocable guaranty of
payment and shall continue in effect notwithstanding any extension or
modification of the terms of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
13.09_.
