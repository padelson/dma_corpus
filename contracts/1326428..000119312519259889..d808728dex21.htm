MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

3.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or equity interests in Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into
one share of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Class A common
stock, par value $0.001, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Each certificate or book
entry evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall
thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any Cancelled Shares and any
Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $1.52 in cash,
without interest (such amount, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) Each share of common stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will remain issued and outstanding and will not
be affected by the Merger.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Cancelled
Shares will automatically be cancelled and no consideration will be received
therefor.

(e) Company Stock Awards will be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.5_.

 



19

    

3.2 _Rights As Stockholders; Share Transfers_. All shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant
to the Merger. At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") and each
holder of non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid, without interest, in consideration therefor in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of (a) any
holder of Company Stock Awards will be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_,
(b) any holder of Cancelled Shares will be as set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.1(d)_ and (c) any holder of Dissenting Shares will be as set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, holders as of the relevant record date
of shares of Company Common Stock will have continued rights to any dividend,
without interest, with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock with a
record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared
or made by the Company with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remains unpaid as of the
Effective Time. Such dividends by the Company are not part of the Merger
Consideration and will be paid on the payment date set therefor to such
holders of Company Common Stock whether or not they exchange their shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. At the Effective Time,
the transfer books of the Company will be closed immediately and there will
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company with respect to shares of Company Common Stock.

 

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. __ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as required by this _Article_ __ _
III_ (the " _Payment Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Payment Agent for the benefit
of the holders of the applicable shares of Company Common Stock, for payment
in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_, through the Payment Agent, cash
in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Any funds
deposited with the Payment Agent for payment of the Merger Consideration are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Payment Agent will,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Parent and the Company, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, the Exchange Fund will not be
used for any other purpose.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Payment Agent
to mail to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its
Subsidiaries) (A) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of
Certificates, delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment

 



20

    

 Agent, and which will be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the
Company prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions (in customary form
and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates,
if any, for cancellation to the Payment Agent together with such letters of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
(including in respect of Book-Entry Shares) as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, each holder who held shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company and its
wholly owned Subsidiaries and Parent and its wholly owned Subsidiaries) will
be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares therefor, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ III_. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration.

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock
may be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Company
Common Stock or evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Shares is presented to
the Payment Agent, and in the case of both Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
of Company Common Stock, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will
pay to the Payment Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that
of the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, or will
establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not payable. Until such required documentation has been delivered
and Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such delivery and surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock.

(c) _No Further Rights in_ _Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock after
365 days following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand
by Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of shares of
Company Common Stock who have not complied with this  _Article_ __ _ III_ by
such date will thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent. Without limitation of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, after 365 days following the Effective Time, any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock will become
the property of Parent, subject to 

 



21

    

 the legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled thereto under
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the Sponsor, the Guarantors, the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent nor any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock or Company
Stock Awards, as applicable, for any amount properly delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in a customary
amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent will pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(f) _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and the Payment Agent (without duplication) are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock
Awards, or any other Person, such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent reasonably deems to be required
to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local
or non-U.S. Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid or issued to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

(g) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Payment Agent to
invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, in Parents sole
discretion; ___provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon
affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Awards, as
applicable, pursuant to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid promptly to Parent; _provided_ _further_ , that the
Exchange Fund shall not be invested in any instruments other than direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the government of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or in
money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment.

 



22

    

3.4 _Adjustment_. Without limiting the covenants in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, in
the event the outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class after the date hereof by
reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, share dividends,
combinations or exchanges of shares Company Common Stock, the Merger
Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Stock Awards, as applicable, the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event,
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

3.5  _Treatment of Company Stock_ _Awards_.

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _
3.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, effective as of the Effective
Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock Units that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically, and without any
required action of the holder thereof, become fully vested and non-forfeitable
and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company
Restricted Stock Units subject to such award multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) _Company Performance Share Units_. Except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, effective as of the Effective
Time, each award of Company Performance Share Units that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically, and without any
required action of the holder thereof, be cancelled without consideration.

(c) All cash amounts payable to the former holders of Company Restricted Stock
Units shall be subject to all Tax and other withholding amounts that are
required to be withheld under applicable Law and shall be paid through the
regular payroll or other applicable pay processes of the Company in connection
with the Closing.

 

(d) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Company to file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 registration
statement filed by the Company on October 16, 2018 deregistering all shares of
Company Common Stock thereunder.

 

(e) Not later than the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated each
Company Stock Plan and no further Company Performance Share Units, Company
Restricted Stock Units or other rights with respect to Company Common Stock
shall be granted thereunder. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date hereof and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the treatment of the
Company Performance Share Units or Company Restricted Stock Units pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, which resolutions will also provide that such
Company Performance Share Units or Company Restricted Stock Units shall
terminate conditioned upon, and effective immediately after, the Effective
Time.

 

3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to each Dissenting Share, such Dissenting Share shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be cancelled and shall represent the right to receive only the
payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the
Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _ provided_, __ _ however_, that if
any such Person shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of

 



23

    

 such Person to receive those rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
cease and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any written withdrawal or
purported withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time that relates
to such demand, and Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle,
make any payments with respect to or offer to settle, any claim with respect
to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent, in Parents sole
discretion. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Payment Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ to pay for Company Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.6 _shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

4.7 _Financial Reports and the Company SEC Document_ _s._

 

(a) Since September 24, 2018, the Company has filed or furnished with the SEC
all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules, exhibits and
statements required to be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act. At the time filed (or, in the case of registration statements,
solely on the dates of effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by
a subsequently filed Company SEC Document prior to the date hereof, in which
case as of the date of such amendment), each Company SEC Document complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, as the case may be, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



27

    

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (the " _Company Financial Statements_ ") as of their
respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto, to the extent permitted by applicable SEC
regulations) and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to the absence of footnotes and to normal year-end adjustments).

 

4.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established and
maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting, including policies and procedures that (a)
mandate the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the material transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
appropriate authorizations of management and the Company Board and (c) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board, and  _Schedule 4.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, (i) all significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have identified for the Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such deficiencies or frauds
have not occurred that would reasonably be expected, either individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
the Company, since September 24, 2018, no complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been
received by the Company. Since September 24, 2018, the Company has
not received any material complaints through the Companys whistleblower
hotline or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding
possible violations of applicable Law. The principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

Governmental Authority alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law,

Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in full force

4.14 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the Oil and Gas Properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the reserve report prepared by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (the " _Company Indepen_ _dent Petroleum Engineers_
"), in each case referred to in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the " _Company Reserve_ _Report_ "),
was accurate in all material respects at the time such data was provided to
the Company Independent Petroleum Engineers. With respect to the proved
reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Report, the Company Reserve Report
conforms in all material respects to the guidelines with respect thereto of
the SEC. Except for changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity
prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Company Reserve Report that would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and except for property
(i) sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the
date of the Company Reserve Report, (ii) reflected in the Company Reserve
Report or in the Company SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise
disposed of, or (iii) other than sales or dispositions after the date hereof
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, free
and clear of all Liens, except for Liens constituting Permitted Encumbrances,
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the continued use and operation of the Oil and Gas
Properties to which they relate by the Company and each of its Subsidiary.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that
the Companys or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title to
each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be
held or owned by them) (A) entitles the Company (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production
Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share
shown in Company Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and
Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (B)
obligates the Company (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to
bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and
development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of
not greater than the working interest shown on Company Reserve Report for such
Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive differences in such
percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on Company Reserve
Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate
(or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (C) is
free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens constituting Permitted
Encumbrances, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to materially impair the continued use and operation of the Oil and
Gas Properties to which they relate in the conduct of the business of the
Company and each of its Subsidiary as presently conducted. _Schedule 4.14(b)_
lists any third parties to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
have paid amounts associated with Production Burdens in excess of $1,000,000
since January 1, 2018.

 



34

    

(c) (i) All rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or
individual under (or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases of the
Company or any of its Subsidiary have been properly and timely paid, (ii) all
royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other Production
Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly paid (in each
case, except (A) such Production Burdens (x) as are being currently
paid prior to delinquency in the ordinary course of business or (y) the
amount or validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and (B)
such payments that may be delayed due to timing of pooling orders from the
Oklahoma Corporation Commission or division order title opinions) and (iii)
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to Companys Knowledge,
no third-party operator) has violated any material provision of, or taken or
failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or
entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease)
included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the material Oil and
Gas Properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any
preferential purchase, consent or similar right that would become operative
as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity, each material Oil and Gas Lease (i) constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and effect and
(iii) immediately after the Effective Time will continue to constitute a valid
and binding obligation of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties thereto in accordance
with its terms. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent it is
a party thereto or bound thereby) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
other party thereto has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under each material Oil and Gas Lease. There is
not, to the Knowledge of the Company, under any material Oil and Gas Lease,
any default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice
of termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case, except
such events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to which
requisite waivers or consents have been obtained, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of any material violation or breach of, material default under or
intention to cancel, terminate, modify or not renew any material Oil and Gas
Lease.

 

(f) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being received by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a timely manner in all material respects.

 



35

    

(g) All of the Hydrocarbon Wells and all water, CO2 or injection Wells located
on the Oil and Gas Leases or of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
drilled, completed and operated, as applicable, within the limits permitted by
the applicable Contracts and applicable Law, in all material respects, and all
drilling and completion (and plugging and abandonment, including plugging and
abandonment of permanently plugged Wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases) of
the Hydrocarbon Wells and such other Wells and all related development,
production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with all
applicable Law in all material respects.

(h) All Oil and Gas Properties operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil and
gas field practices in all material respects and in material compliance with
the applicable Oil and Gas Leases and applicable Law.

 

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, other than as set forth in the Companys
capital budget as provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
there is no outstanding authorization for expenditure or similar request or
invoice for funding or participation under any Contract which are binding on
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Oil and Gas Properties and which
the Company reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000.

 

4.15 _Rights-of-Way_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has such
consents, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses from each Person
(collectively, " _Rights-of-Way_ ") as are sufficient to conduct its business
in the manner currently conducted, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence
of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with
respect to such Rights-of-Way and conduct their business in a manner that does
not violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows,
or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination
thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any
such Rights-of-Way, except for such violations, revocations, terminations and
impairments that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All pipelines operated by
the Company and its Subsidiaries are subject to Rights-of-Way or are located
on real property owned or leased by the Company, and there are no gaps
(including any gap arising as a result of any breach by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way
other than gaps that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.16  _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, litigation, claims, causes of
action, arbitrations, mediations or other proceedings (collectively, "
_Proceedings_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
a threatened party.

4.17 _Information Supplied_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will,
on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to Company Stockholders, and
at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable

(a) (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to
be timely filed when due (taking into account extensions of time for filing)
with the appropriate Taxing Authority all U.S. federal income Tax Returns and
all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax
Returns were true, complete and correct in all material respects and (ii)
all material Taxes owed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return), including Taxes required to be collected or withheld
from payments to employees, creditors, shareholders or other third parties,
have been duly and timely paid in full, except for amounts being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP by the party responsible for payment
thereof.

 

(b) No deficiencies for material Taxes with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Taxing

income) as reflected on the face of the applicable balance sheet (rather than
in any notes thereto). Since the Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes outside

(e) No written claim has ever been made by any Taxing Authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file a Tax
Return that it is or may be subject to any material Tax in such jurisdiction
in respect of Taxes that would be covered by or the subject of such Tax
Return, nor has any such assertion been threatened or proposed in writing and
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of
deduction from, taxable income for any period (or any portion thereof) ending

transaction disposition made prior to the Closing, (ii) an adjustment under
either Section 481(a) or Section 482 of the Code by reason of an accounting
method change prior to the Closing for a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date, (iii) a "closing agreement" described in Section 7121 of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law) with any Taxing Authority filed or entered into prior to the
Closing, (iv) any prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing or (v) an
intercompany transaction or any excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

 

(g) There are no Liens for material Taxes upon any assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(i) Except for the Tax Matters Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax allocation, sharing, indemnity or
reimbursement agreement or arrangement (excluding any such agreements pursuant
to customary provisions in Contracts not primarily related to Taxes).
The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of the
Tax Matters Agreement. No material claims for loss or indemnity have been made
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Tax Matters Agreement
that are now pending.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code (or any
similar group defined under a similar provision of foreign, state or local Tax
Law), other than a group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or
was the common parent, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability for material Taxes of any other person (other than Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law), as a
transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

 

(k) Within the last two (2) years, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a party to any transaction intended to qualify for tax-
free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.

control or other similar payment in excess of $100,000 shall be considered a
material Company Employee Benefit Plan. A " _Company Employee Benefit Plan_ "
means each Employee Benefit Plan that is sponsored, maintained or contributed
to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or with respect to which the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates could have any material obligation or
material liability (including any contingent liability).

 

(b) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Employee
Benefit Plan has been maintained, administered and operated in all respects
(i) in compliance with its terms, and (ii) in compliance with the applicable
provisions of all Laws applicable to such Company Employee Benefit
Plan. There are no governmental audits or investigations, actions or claims
pending (other than routine claims for benefits), or to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, with respect to any of the Company Employee Benefit Plans
that would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Since August 31, 2017, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the

contributed to, or has had any liability with respect to, any plan that is (i)
subject to the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code, (ii)
subject to Title IV of ERISA or (iii) a "multiemployer plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer plan as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code.

 



39

    

(e) Each of the Company Employee Benefit Plans intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is maintained pursuant to a prototype or a
volume submitter document approved by the Internal Revenue Service and is
entitled to rely on a favorable opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to such prototype or volume submitter document, as
applicable, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone or in combination
with another event or events, (i) result in any payments of money or property,
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting, or provisions of other rights,
(ii) result in any loan forgiveness to any current or former Employee or
(iii) increase the amount or value of compensation (including funding of
compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise).

 

(g) No amount or benefit that could be, or has been, received (whether in cash
or property, or the vesting of property or the cancellation of indebtedness)
by any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code would be reasonably expected to be an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) Each Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred

(i) There is no Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement which requires the
Company or any Subsidiary to pay a Tax gross-up or reimbursement payment to
any employee or other service provider, including without limitation, with
respect to any Tax-related payments under Section 409A of the Code or Section
280G or 4999 of the Code.

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for

Subsidiaries, except as required to comply with Section 4980B of the Code or
any similar state law provision.

 

(k) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.19(k)_ of the Company Disclosure

any Company Employee Benefit Plan that is a short-term or long-term bonus.

 

(l) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with
all applicable Law relating to the employment of labor, including all such
applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers compensation,

aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse

 



40

    

 Effect, as of the date hereof, there are no pending or threatened claims,
actions, suits or arbitrations, by or on behalf of any current or former
Employees or other service providers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise concerning the labor or employment-related practices
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would not result in a
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, no individual
who has performed services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been
improperly excluded from participation in any Employee Benefit Plan. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material direct or
indirect liability, whether actual or contingent, with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than as an
employee, as exempt versus non-exempt, or with respect to any employee
engaged or leased from another employer.

(m) Neither the Company not any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or subject
to, a collective bargaining agreement with any labor union or similar
representative of any current or former Employees and no trade or labor union
or other labor representative or organization has made a demand for
recognition, or filed a petition to be certified, as the bargaining unit
representative of any current or former Employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are, and within the prior three (3) years have been, no
pending or threatened strikes, work stoppages, lockouts, material grievances,
unfair labor practice charges, or other material job actions against or
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(n) No Employee or individual service provider of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries resides outside of the United States or provides services
primarily outside of the United States, and there is no Company Employee
Benefit Plan that covers Employees or individual service providers of the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries who reside outside of the United States or
perform, or performed, services primarily outside the United States.

(o) _Schedule 4.19(o)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, along with (i) their current annualized base
salary or hourly wage rate (and for hourly employees the number of regularly
scheduled hours worked per week), and (ii) an itemized breakdown of all cash
and other payments that would become payable on a non-discretionary basis to
such employees under all applicable Company Employee Benefit Plans (excluding
the Roan Resources LLC Health and Welfare Plan or any component program
thereunder and the Roan Resources 401(k) Plan) if their employment is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation (or its applicable Subsidiary)
immediately following the Effective Time and assuming such employee signs and
does not revoke a release of claims, excluding amounts payable under _Section_
__ _ 3.5_.

 

(p) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.19(p)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no penalty or termination fee is required to be paid, and no notice
is required to be sent, in order to terminate the engagement of any individual
engaged in the capacity of an independent contractor by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

4.20 _Intellectual Property_. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have the
right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of its
business as presently conducted (collectively, the " _Company Intellectual
Property_ "), free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances,
except where the failure to own or have the right to use such Intellectual
Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to have a Company

 



41

    

 Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, the use of the
Company Intellectual Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of the business of the Company as presently conducted does not
infringe upon or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person,
except for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

4.21 _Insurance_. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain, or are entitled
to the benefits of, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as the Company believes to be customary for the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. Except as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (a) all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement are in
full force and effect, and all premiums due on such policies have been paid
and (b) the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and
provisions of all insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under, or has taken any
action that would permit termination or material modification of, any material
insurance policies.

 

4.22 _Financial Advisors_. The Company has not incurred any liability for
fees, commissions or reimbursement of expenses of any broker, finder,
investment banker, financial advisor or similar advisor in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company will have
any responsibility or liability whatsoever, excluding fees to be paid to
the Company Financial Advisors. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of the Companys letter agreements under
which fees and expenses are payable to, and related indemnification and other
material agreements with, the Company Financial Advisors entered into in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.23 _Opinion_ _s of the Company Financial Advisors_. The Company Board has
received the separate opinions of the Company Financial Advisors each to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other matters set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the Company Stockholders
(other than, as applicable, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

 

4.24 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IV_ are and shall constitute the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties made with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the representations and
warranties referred to in previous sentence, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person has made or is making any express or implied
representations or warranty, statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including
with respect to any express or implied representation or warranty as to the
merchantability, quality, quantity, suitability or fitness for any particular
purpose of the business or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ IV_, all other warranties, express or implied, statutory or
otherwise, of any nature, including with respect to any express or implied
representation or warranty as to the

 



42

    

 merchantability, quality, quantity, suitability or fitness for any
particular purpose of the business or the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, are hereby expressly disclaimed. The Company represents,
warrants, covenants and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that
in determining to enter into and consummate this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, it is not relying upon, and has not been
induced by, any representation or warranty made or purportedly made by or on
behalf of any Person, other than those expressly made by Parent as set forth
in _Article_ __ _ V_, or by any estimate, projection forecast, plan, budget
or other prediction, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or
presentations, including any memoranda and materials provided by or on behalf
of Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries or any other Person. Such information
is not and shall not be deemed to be a representation or warranty of Parent,
except to the extent explicitly set forth in _Article_ __ _ V_ hereof as a
representation and warranty by Parent.

licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing to do business as a
limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its
properties makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for such

standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Merger Sub (i) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted and (ii) is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing to do business

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

5.2 _Power, Authority and Approvals of Transactions_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has the requisite limited liability company or corporate power and

rights generally or by general equitable principles).

 



43

and state securities laws, assuming the other consents and approvals
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_ are duly
obtained and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in
_Section_ __ _ 7.7(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
by Parent do not and will not: (a) constitute a breach or violation of, or
result in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise,
lease, Contract, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties is subject or bound except for
such breaches, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b)

Parent LLC Agreement; (c) materially contravene or conflict with or constitute
a material violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or (d) result in the creation of any

pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or property or to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or properties is otherwise a party
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a threatened party, except for Proceedings

5.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied (or to be
supplied) in writing by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
Company Stockholders, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
or its Affiliates or Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



44

    

5.7 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged
in no business other than in connection with entering into this Agreement and
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.8 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and
accurate fully executed copies of (a) a debt commitment letter (including any
amendments thereto to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed such letter as of the date hereof,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), among the lenders party thereto (the "
_Lenders_ ") and Parent, (b) the related fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ," and
together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Letters_ ") redacted in
a customary manner solely with respect to all fees, syndication hold levels
and all flex items, which redacted information does not adversely affect the
amount, availability or conditionality of the funding of the Debt Financing,
in each case, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to
such letters in effect as of the date hereof, pursuant to which and subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth therein,
the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Debt Commitment
Letter and (c) the Equity Commitment Letter (together with the Debt Letters,
the " _Commitment Letters_ "), between the Guarantors and Parent, pursuant to
which the Guarantors have committed to invest the amounts set forth therein in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein (the " _Equity Financing_
" and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third-party
beneficiary thereof and Parent and the Guarantors will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights, in each
case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter. Except as permitted under _Section_ __ _ 7.14(a)_, the Commitment
Letters (i) have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (ii) to the Knowledge of
Parent, no such withdrawal, rescission, amendment, restatement, modification
or waiver is contemplated (other than any such amendment, modification, or
restatement to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who have not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date
hereof). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
subject in each case to bankruptcy laws and similar laws affecting creditors
rights and general principles of equity. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment
Letters, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. At the
Closing and assuming the full funding of the Financing, Parent and Merger Sub
will have sufficient funds to pay all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses required to be paid in
connection therewith. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the
part of Parent under the Commitment Letters or otherwise result in any portion
of the Financing to be unavailable. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no side letters or other agreements or Contracts that could affect the
availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full

 



45

    

 any and all commitment fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior
to the date hereof under the terms of the Commitment Letters and will pay all
other commitment fees and other fees as required to be paid as a condition to
funding the Financing under the terms of the Commitment Letters on or prior to
the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent (A) is not aware of any
fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Parent in any of the Commitment Letters that constitutes a
condition precedent to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date
inaccurate in any material respect and (B) assuming the accuracy of Companys
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and performance by
Company of its obligations hereunder, has no reason to believe that, subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in _Sections 8.1_ ,
_8.2_ and _8.3_ , any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be made available on
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
a breach of this representation and warranty shall not result in the failure
of a condition precedent to the Companys obligations under this Agreement,
if (notwithstanding such breach) Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able
to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date.

5.9  _Guarant_ _ee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Guarantors, enforceable against the Guarantors
in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
rehabilitation, liquidation, preferential transfer, moratorium and similar
Laws now or hereafter affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at equity or law)). No event has
occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would, or
would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee.

 

5.10 _No Other Arrangements_. Except for the Voting Agreements, neither
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors nor any of their respective Affiliates is
a party to any Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed
or agreed to enter into, any formal or informal arrangements, agreements or
understandings (binding or non-binding) with any Company Stockholder or its
Affiliates, or any director, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Company
(including, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, any Significant

with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, and request the
return or destruction of all confidential information previously provided to
such Persons by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company
agrees that it shall promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Except as permitted by this _Section_

solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information) any proposal or offer or any
inquiries regarding the making of any proposal or offer, including any
proposal or offer to its stockholders, that constitutes, or would be
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal; (ii) participate
or engage in or otherwise knowingly facilitate any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any

exchange agreement or any other agreement (whether binding or not) with
respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would

Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; or (v) resolve or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 



51

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company has received a bona fide written Alternative Proposal that is made
after the date of this Agreement and that did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_; and (ii) the Company
Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal,
then the Company may, subject to clauses (x), (y) and (z) below, (A) furnish
information, including confidential information, with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company provides to Parent the notice
required by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ with respect to such Alternative
Proposal, (y) the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers and employees, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives not
to disclose any non-public information to such Person unless the Company has,
or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality provisions that are not materially less restrictive to such
Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent a
copy of which shall be promptly provided to Parent, which shall not contain
any exclusivity provision or other term that would restrict, in any
manner, the Companys ability to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or to comply with its disclosure obligations
to Parent pursuant to this Agreement, and (z) prior to or substantially
concurrently with providing or making available to such other Person any non-
public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent, the Company will provide such
non-public information to Parent.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company will promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing of any
Alternative Proposal or any offer, proposal or request for discussions
or negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal (and any changes thereto)
or non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that could reasonably be expected to lead to or in connection with an
Alternative Proposal, including the identity of the Person making the
Alternative Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or request and (i) if it is
in writing, a copy of any such Alternative Proposal or inquiry, request,
offer or proposal and any related draft agreements or (ii) if not made in
writing, the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal.
The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of material
developments with respect to any such Alternative Proposal, including
material changes to the status and materials terms of any such proposal or
offer (including any material amendments thereto or any material change to the
scope or material terms or conditions thereof).

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof will directly or indirectly: (i) (A)
withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or fail to make, or, except in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e) or __Section_ __ _
6.3(f)_, authorize or resolve to or propose or announce its intention to
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (B) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal or (C) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business
Days after Parent so requests in writing, which request is transmitted within
five (5) Business Days after any public disclosure of an Alternative Proposal
(provided that the Company shall have no obligation to make such reaffirmation
on more than one occasion other than following a material modification of such
Alternative Proposal); (ii) approve, adopt, authorize, resolve or recommend,
or propose to approve, adopt, authorize, resolve or recommend, any

 



52

    

 Alternative Proposal; (iii) approve, adopt, authorize, resolve or recommend,
or propose to approve, adopt, authorize, resolve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar Contract or any tender or exchange offer providing
for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal; or (iv)
fail to publicly announce, within ten (10) Business Days after a tender offer
or exchange relating to the securities of the Company shall have been
commenced, a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection
of such tender offer or exchange offer and affirms the Company Board
Recommendation (any action described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ being
referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
a public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an Alternative
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not
be deemed a Change in Recommendation.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal from any Person that did not
result from or arise in connection with a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this _Section_ __ _
6.3(e)_, after (x) determining in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) determining in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(i) make a Change in Recommendation or (ii) terminate this Agreement under
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(h)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating
to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not take any such action pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii)
unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice (which notice must state
that the Company Board has made the determinations contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_) to Parent
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including
a description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and identifying the Person or group making such Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously delivered to Parent a copy of the proposed definitive
agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for such Superior Proposal
in the form to be entered into (and any other relevant proposed transaction
agreements) at least three (3) Business Days in advance of its intention to
take such action, unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be
given there are less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Company
Meeting, in which case the Company will provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Superior Proposal Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ and a new Superior Proposal
Notice Period, except that such new Superior Proposal Notice Period in
connection with any such amendment shall be for two (2) Business Days from the
time Parent receives such notice (as opposed to three (3) Business Days));

(ii) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company has negotiated
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



53

    

(iii) at the end of the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, taking into account any adjustment or modification
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing,
that (A) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal if the amended terms proposed by Parent were to be given effect and
(B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure of the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 9.1(h)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company shall not
be entitled to enter into any definitive acquisition agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless and until (i) this Agreement is terminated and (ii)
the Company Termination Fee has been paid by the Company to Parent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval to make a Change in Recommendation in connection with an Intervening
Event but only if prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not make
such a Change in Recommendation unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice (which notice must specify
in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change in Recommendation) at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of its intention to make such Change in
Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be
given there are less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Company
Meeting, in which case the Company will provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Intervening Event Notice Period_ ");

(ii) during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company has negotiated
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit
the Company Board to determine that the failure of the Company Board to
make a Change in Recommendation would not reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(iii) at the end of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
and taking into account any adjustment or modification to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing, that the failure
of the Company Board to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



54

    

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Company Stockholders,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such position does not comply with the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or otherwise has the substantive
effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying or qualifying the Company Board
Recommendation, such action shall be deemed to effect a Change in
Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement. Any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication by the Company or the Company Board to the Company Stockholders
that contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company
Stockholders) will not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal,
modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion
of the Company Board Recommendation.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, and did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, relating to or would reasonably be expected to
lead to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions), outside of the ordinary
course of business, of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or to
which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income, assets or earnings
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are attributable;(B)
direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the
Company, including pursuant to a stock purchase, merger, consolidation or
other transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole;(C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or other equity securities of the Company (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company,
including pursuant to a stock purchase, merger, consolidation or other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or(D)merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or at least 20% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the
Company (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company, including pursuant to a stock
purchase, merger, consolidation or other transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



55

    

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written offer, obtained after the date
of this Agreement that did not result from or arise in connection with a
material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, to acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the Company Stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at the
time of determination all financial, legal and regulatory terms and
conditions of the alternative proposal and this Agreement, including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed
to by Parent in writing in response to such Superior Proposal, including
any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, any risks of non-
consummation, of such proposal and, to the extent third-party financing is
required and the Company Board determines in good faith that such financing
is reasonably likely to be obtained.

ARTICLE VII.

 

COVENANTS

The Company hereby covenants to and agrees with Parent, and Parent and Merger
Sub hereby covenant to and agree with the Company, on their behalf and on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, that:

 

7.1 _Proxy Statement_ _; Company Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent will prepare and the Company will file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other
in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and furnish all information
concerning itself that is required in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the Other Party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company
Stockholders. The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and the Company will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



56

    

(b) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Company Meeting. Subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company will, through the Company Board, recommend
to the Company Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement in accordance with
the DGCL (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). The Proxy Statement shall
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) include the Company Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) if there are not
holders of a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Company Meeting to constitute a quorum at the
Company Meeting, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders prior
to the Company Meeting and (iv) if the Company has delivered any notice
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and the time period contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.3 _has not expired.

 

7.2 _Consummation of the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section_
__ _ 7.2(d)_), Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing
to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than
March 17, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ "), and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws); (ii) obtain
promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all Governmental
Approvals and expirations or terminations of any applicable waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay any HSR Act filing
fee.

 



57

    

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding
initiated by a private Person; (ii) promptly inform the Other Party of (and
supply to the Other Party) any communication received by such Party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) permit the Other Party to review in
advance and incorporate the Other Partys reasonable comments in
any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with
respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) consult with
the Other Party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, the Parties will take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable
privilege.

 

(d) Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its
Subsidiaries), any all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and to avoid or eliminate each impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent
or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), or the Surviving
Corporation or any equity interest in any joint venture held by Parent (or any
of its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) creating, terminating
or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of
Parent or the Company (or and of their respective Subsidiaries) or the
Surviving Corporation and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to take any
action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or Company (including
any of their respective Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Corporation or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by Parent (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Corporation, in each case as may be required in
order to obtain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust
Law or to avoid the commencement of any action to prohibit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under

 



58

    

 any Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Merger or
delay the Closing. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the Company will enter into one or more
agreements requested by Parent to be entered into prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any
action that limits the Surviving Corporations freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Surviving Corporation or any equity interest in any joint
venture held by the Surviving Corporation (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the consummation of the transactions provided
for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action will be conditioned upon
the Closing.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, if any administrative or judicial
Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company will use reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.

7.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, throughout the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ IX_ hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to (and,
with respect to books and records, the right to copy) all of its and its
Subsidiaries properties (including for purposes of environmental assessment,
which may include subsurface or other invasive testing or sampling only upon
the Companys express prior written approval, such approval not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), commitments, books, Contracts,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other Representatives. Each Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Party
(i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by
it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a
copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party
from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, properties and
personnel as the Other Party may reasonably request (including information
necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement). Except for disclosures permitted by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each Party and
its Representatives shall hold information received from the Other Party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not require either Party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of
such Party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
Contract to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or Law applicable
to such Party or its Subsidiaries or (ii) the potential waiver of any
privilege (including

 



59

    

 attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would
be entitled to assert with respect to such information and such potential
waiver could in such Partys good faith judgment (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material
respect such Partys position in any pending or, what such Party believes in
good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)
could be, future litigation. Nor shall any party be required to permit access
to any information reasonably pertinent to any litigation in which the Other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, are adverse to each other. Notwithstanding
the foregoing in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Parties hereto
shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of
such information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar
agreement) to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of
the Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in
the violation of any such Contract or applicable Law or reasonably be likely
to cause a potential waiver of privilege with respect to such information
or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-
room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the Other
Party shall be provided access to such information. In addition, the Party
being requested to disclose the information shall (1) notify the Other Party
that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any such Contract or applicable Law or are
reasonably likely to cause a potential waiver of privilege, (2) communicate
to the Other Party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such
notification and the subject matter of such information (to the extent it is
able to do so in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and (3) in the
case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any Contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such Contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such Contract).

 

7.4 _Public Statements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will
not, and each will cause its respective Representatives not to, issue any
public announcements (including a press release) or make other
public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, without the prior written approval of the Other Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Party or its Representatives may issue a public announcement
or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which such Partys equity securities are traded; _provided_ that
such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an
opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and
provide reasonable comment regarding the same. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.4_, however, shall be deemed to restrict in any manner (i) the Companys
ability to communicate with its employees or (ii) any customary
communications or distributions of marketing materials in connection with
obtaining, marketing and syndicating the Debt Financing, nor shall the Company
be required by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ to consult with Parent or any other
Person with respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt
and existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a
Change in Recommendation, other than as required pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.3_.

 



60

    

7.5 _Confidentiality_. The obligations of Parent and the Company under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and all
information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Confidential Information"
as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
performance by the Company or Parent of their respective obligations under
this Agreement and, in the case of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with
customary practices in connection with the Financing subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ ___further_ , that beginning on the date of this Agreement,
"Representatives" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement shall also
include potential equity financing sources of Parent or the Sponsor.

 

7.6 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Company nor Parent will take any action that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
Agreements to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and
each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements from the Takeover Laws of any state that
purport to apply to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

7.7 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all
filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with the terms and
conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and to
cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable. Each of
Parent and the Company has the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties agrees to
act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it will consult with
the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Parties apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees, upon request, to furnish the Other
Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of such Other Party or any of such
Other Partys Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) This  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall not apply to (i) approval under
Antitrust Laws or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Proxy Statement.

 



61

    

7.8 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent or fiduciary may have under any applicable
insurance policy, any employment or indemnification agreement (including the
Director Indemnification Agreements) or under the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws, resolution of the Company Board or Company Stockholders, this
Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to
the Effective Time, (A) an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) serving at the request of or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not
such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Company), together with
such Persons heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and
administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law from and against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) arising out of or in connection with any Claim or Action
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in clause
(ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_ with respect to a Claim or Action to
enforce rights with respect to indemnification or advancement, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall not be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
Party in connection with a Claim or Action (or part thereof) initiated by such
Indemnified Party; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within fifteen (15)
days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified
Parties any Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim
or Action in advance of the final disposition of such Claim or Action,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Indemnification Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in
each case without the requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if required by applicable Law, it shall be a condition to
the payment or advancement of any Indemnification Expenses that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation receive an undertaking by the Indemnified Party to
repay such Indemnification Expenses paid or advanced if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under
applicable Law or pursuant to this Agreement. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_ extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Effective Time and any Claim or Action relating thereto (including
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
adoption or approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration
and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and
any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified
Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof (with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to such cessation) and inure to the benefit of such
Indemnified Partys heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and the

 



62

    

 Surviving Corporation shall not be required to provide rights to
indemnification or payment or advancement of Indemnification Expenses to any
Indemnified Person that are more expansive than those provided to such
Indemnified Person under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws, and Director
Indemnification Agreements, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_: (x) the term "
_Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action or
proceeding, whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any
other person that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ ") arising out of
or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries
or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any compensation and
benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term " _Indemnification Expenses_ "
means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
reasonable telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred
in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_, including any Action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified
Party; and (z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to, (1) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any provision of the DGCL that authorizes or
permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the
corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL; and
(2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its directors or
officers. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DGCL that adversely
affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only and does
not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect of which
indemnification has been or would reasonably be expected to be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without either Parents or the Surviving
Corporations prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate. In such
instance, the conflicted Indemnified Parties shall have a right to retain one
separate counsel, at the expense of Parent. In the event of any such Action,
each applicable Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof. In the event that any Indemnified
Party receives recovery from any insurance policy for matters for which such
Indemnified Party has been indemnified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.8(a)_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event, within no
later than two (2) Business Days) reimburse Parent or Surviving Corporation
as applicable for such Indemnification Expenses.

 



63

    

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Company Charter
and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement or other organizational
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements
(including the Director Indemnification Agreements) of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and Parent in
the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, except to the
extent required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of the
Companys Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Charter,
Company Bylaws and Director Indemnification Agreements, which provisions will
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then
only to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided_ , ___however_ , that
any such modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or
eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action involving any
occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took
place prior to modification; and _provided_ ___further_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any Claim made
within such period continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such Claim including any appeals therefrom.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the directors and officers
liability insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (" _D andO
Insurance_") at the Effective Time (but Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may, in its sole discretion, substitute therefor other policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring on or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , for avoidance of doubt, that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed to have fulfilled this
obligation by maintaining the "tail" policy for such DandO Insurance as
specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date hereof and will purchase
the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the
coverage described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(d)_ would cost in excess of
that amount.

 



64

    

(e) It is acknowledged and agreed that, as of the date of this Agreement and
in conjunction with the extension of the policy period for the DandO Insurance,
the Company has agreed to prepay the premium for a six (6) year "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Insurance, which "tail" policy shall incept at
the Effective Time. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the DandO Insurance continues to
be extended through the Effective Time and that such "tail" policy incepts as
of the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in
lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) under
_Section_ __ _ 7.8(d)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained
in full force and effect. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the Company to purchase such
other six (6) year "tail" prepaid policies that will incept at the Effective
Time for other insurance policies as appropriate, including the Companys
current fiduciary liability insurance policies. The Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policies in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder.

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ contemporaneous with the
closing of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

(g) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

shall cause Parent and Merger Sub to be added as additional insureds on the
following insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries: general liability, business automobile, umbrella liability and
cost of control and extra expense.

(i) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to be named as the successor-
ininterest to the Companys rights under the "tail" policy for the
Companys DandO Insurance.

(j) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to renew or extend and maintain under similar coverage
terms and conditions any insurance policy currently in place with the Company
that is scheduled to expire prior to the Closing.

 

(k) This _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified

representatives, and will be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns.

7.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, to the extent
in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of (a) (i) any notice or other
communication received by such Party or its Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain
such consent is reasonably likely to be material to the Company, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, (ii) any event or circumstance constituting or relating
to any breach or default by any party to any documentation governing
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) of the receipt by
Company or its Subsidiaries of any written notice from any creditor with
respect to any actual breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to an arrangement governing Indebtedness; (b) any actions, suits,

circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VIII_;
and (d) any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which
would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the
Closing in _Article_ __ _ VIII_. In the case of clauses (c) and (d), however,
the failure to comply with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall not result in the
failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article_
__ _ VIII_, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under 
_Article_ __ _ IX_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure
would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 

7.10 _Section 16_ _Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) or appropriate to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to the Surviving Corporation, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.11 _[Reserved]_. 

7.12 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any security holder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall bear its own fees
and expenses related thereto and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall give the Company

security holder litigation against Parent or its directors relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Company
shall bear its own fees and expenses related thereto and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate, shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to cooperate and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to cooperate in the defense against such litigation.

 



66

    

7.13 _Equity Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Equity Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including, but not
limited to, using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
that are applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries in the Equity Commitment
Letter and comply with all of their respective obligations thereunder and not
take or fail to take, directly or indirectly, any action that would be

of the Equity Financing to Parent at the Closing and (iii) diligently and in
good faith enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

(b) In the event that all conditions to the Equity Financing have been
satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Guarantors to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing (including by taking
enforcement action, which shall include but is not limited to specific
performance, to cause the Guarantors to fund the Equity Financing).

(c) Parent shall not have the right to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or consent to or waive any provision or any of its rights under, the
Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification, consent or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Equity Financing from that contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand upon
the conditions precedent to the Equity Financing as set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter to an amount that would not enable Parent to meet
its obligations under this Agreement, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to pay all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection herewith and with the Equity Financing, (iii) prevent
or impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or make the timely funding of the Equity Financing or satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Equity Financing less likely to occur or
(iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Guarantors when required pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company a true and complete copy of any such amendment or
modification.

 

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt oral and written notice (but in any
event not later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence or discovery
thereof) (i) of any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Equity Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from any Person
(written or oral) with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Equity Commitment Letter, of
any provisions thereof or (B) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to the Equity Commitment Letter that could reasonably be
expected to result in an actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Equity Commitment Letter, or any provision
thereof, or (iii) of the occurrence of any event or development that Parent
expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to
obtain on a timely basis all or any portion of the Equity Financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter.

 



67

    

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the Equity Financing is not
a condition to its obligation to consummate the Merger.

7.14 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
and consummate the Debt Financing on terms and conditions not less favorable
(taken as a whole) to Parent than those described in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements (such
definitive agreements being referred to as the " _Debt Financing Agreements_
") with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto)
in all material respects, or, if available, on other terms at the election of
Parent that would not adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis or obtain the waiver of all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) maintain in full force and effect
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms thereof (including
paying, as the same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts
that become due and payable under the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent
constituting a condition precedent to the funding of the Financing under the
Debt Commitment Letter), (iv) in the event that all conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than conditions that by their nature will not be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) have been satisfied or waived, cause the Persons providing the
Debt Financing (the " _Debt Financing Sources_ " and, together with the
Guarantor, the " _Financing Sources_ ") to fund the Debt Financing in an
amount no less than, in the aggregate with the Equity Financing, the Merger
Consideration and (v) take such actions as are reasonably necessary to
enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach
by the Debt Financing Sources that could reasonably be expected to (A) delay
or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Debt Financing), (B) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources or (C)
adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall have the
right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or
waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ that any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter that amends the Debt Financing
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (1) reduce the length
of the commitment period set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (2) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing such that Parent would not or does not
have sufficient cash or cash proceeds to make all of its required payments
under this Agreement, including under _Article_ __ _ III_, and all associated
fees and expenses required to be paid by it on the Closing Date, (3) impose
new or additional conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing or (4)
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment
Letter in a manner that in any such case of (1) through (3) above, or with
respect to any of the existing conditions precedent to the 

 



68

    

 consummation of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, in each case, could reasonably be expected to (x) delay or make less
likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing), (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Debt Financing Sources or (z) adversely affect the ability of
Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Upon any such replacement, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" (and consequently the terms "Debt Financing," and
"Financing" shall mean the Debt Financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment
Letter as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived), shall mean
such Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived.

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions that are contained in the Fee Letter), Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative Debt
Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing, on terms (including
structure, covenants and pricing) not materially less favorable (taken as a
whole) to Parent (as reasonably determined by Parent) or as otherwise
acceptable to Parent and with lenders or holders, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, from the same or alternative sources, which may
include one or more of a senior secured debt financing or other financing, or
any combination thereof, in an amount such that the aggregate funds that
would be available to Parent at the Closing, including cash on hand, will be
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligations under this Agreement, including
under  _Article_ __ _ III_, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to pay all fees and expenses required to be paid in connection
herewith and with the Financing (the " _Substitute Financing_ ");  _provided_
that any such Substitute Financing shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the consummation of
the Debt Financing or otherwise expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing or (iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision
of the Commitment Letters in a manner that in any such case of (i) through
(iii) above, could reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources or
(C) adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. In such event, the term "Debt
Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Substitute Financing (and consequently the term "Financing" shall include the
Equity Financing and the Substitute Financing), and the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the commitment
letter with respect to such Substitute Financing.

(c) Upon the request by the Company, until the Effective Time, Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail the status of Parents material efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until the Effective Time,
Parent shall notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after it becomes aware thereof, (i) of any termination of the
Debt Commitment Letter or the entry into any material and definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the availability or amount of the Debt Financing, (ii) of any
material breach or default by any party to any Debt Commitment 

 



69

    

 Letter or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing of which
Parent becomes aware and that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the availability or amount of the Debt Financing, (iii) of the receipt by
Parent of any written notice or other written communication (other than
negotiations of the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing)
from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the availability or amount of the Debt
Financing or (iv) if for any reason Parent has concluded in good faith that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information
that is subject to any applicable legal privileges (including the attorney-
client privilege). Parent promptly will provide the Company with copies of all
definitive Debt Financing Agreements, except that the numerical fees, pricing
and other commercially sensitive numbers and provisions specified in any such
Debt Financing Agreements (including any provisions relating to "flex" terms
or similar concepts) that would not adversely affect the aggregate amount,
availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing may have been redacted.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that receipt of the Debt Financing is not a condition
to its obligation to consummate the Merger.

breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.16_ for such counterpartys failure to
authorize the initiation of such Specified Hedging Agreement; _provided_ that

contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

 

7.17 _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent that any sales, purchase, transfer,

to Parent or the Company. In the event of any such termination, the agreements
and obligations of the Parties set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ and  _Article_ __ _ X_ hereof will survive and remain
fully enforceable. In addition, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_,

director, employee or Representative of such Party who would reasonably be
expected to know, or after reasonable due inquiry would learn that the taking
of such act or failure to take such action would be a breach of any covenant
or agreement, or a material failure to perform, will be imputed to such
Person).

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed prior to, and not publicly withdrawn without qualification
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Meeting (or,
if the Company Meeting has not occurred, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_), (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_ and (iii) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Alternative Proposal within
twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement is terminated, then the
Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee.
For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_, the term " _Alternative
Proposal_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ __ _
6.3(h)(i)_, except that the references to "20% or more" are deemed to
be references to "more than 50%."

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(i)_, then the Company will pay
to Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination, the
Company Termination Fee.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(h)_, then the Company will pay to Parent, simultaneously
with such termination, the Company Termination Fee.

The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Company Termination
Fee shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which it
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j)_ or (ii) by either the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ and, as of the date of
such termination, the Company was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j),_ then in
either case Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company (i) the Parent
Termination Fee in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination and (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _
9.4(e)_, the Unwind Reimbursement. The parties acknowledge and hereby agree
that the Parent Termination Fee and Unwind Reimbursement shall not constitute
a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company in the circumstances in which it is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

 



79

    

(e) _Hedge Unwind Reimbursement_.

 

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j)_ or (B) by either the

such termination, the Company was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(j)_ (the "
_Unwinding Scenario_ "), the Company or its applicable Subsidiary may (but
shall not be required to) unwind and liquidate all or any portion of the
Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Specified Hedging Agreements. In
the event the Unwinding Scenario occurs, the Company shall deliver written
notice to Parent identifying the applicable Specified Hedging Agreements it
(or its applicable Subsidiary) is electing to terminate either (1)
concurrently with the Companys termination notice (in the event the Company
is the terminating party) or (2) within one (1) Business Day following
receipt of Parents termination notice (in the event Parent is the terminating
party). Only those Specified Hedging Agreements that the Company (or its
applicable Subsidiary) elects to unwind and liquidate in such notice (the "
_Elected Unwind Hedges_ ") shall be subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 9.4(e)(ii)_, and all other Specified Hedging Agreements, including any
Elected Unwind Hedges that are not unwound or terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)(ii)_ (the " _Elected Retained Hedges_ ") shall instead
be subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)(iii)_.

 

(ii) In the event that the Unwinding Scenario occurs and any Elected Unwind
Hedge is designated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)(i)_, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event by the end of the fourth (4th) Business Day
following the delivery of the notice set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)(i)_)
notify Parent of the aggregate net amount of early termination payments,
calculated in accordance with Section 6(e) of the applicable ISDA Master
Agreement, relating to the Elected Unwind Hedges due and paid by the Company
under the Specified Hedging Agreements (the " _Claimed Amount_ "), together
with supporting documentation and evidence (including, but not limited to,
calculation statements and payment requests from the counterparties) (the "
_Claim Notice_ ") so that Parent may verify the amounts due and owing under
the Elected Unwind Hedges. Parent and the Company shall cooperate, in good
faith, in resolving any disagreements concerning the size of the Claimed
Amount. Following receipt of such Claim Notice, the Company shall as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within eight (8) Business Days) unwind and/or
terminate each of the Elected Unwind Hedges. Parent shall, upon request by the
Company, pay any such termination payments due and owing by the Company (or
its Subsidiary, as applicable) with respect to the Elected Unwind Hedges (such
termination payments, " _Elected Unwind Termination Amount_ ") solely to the
extent that the aggregate Elected Unwind Termination Amount across all
terminated transactions in accordance herewith exceeds the Parent Termination
Fee due and previously paid to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)_, provided that such amount shall not exceed the Unwind Cap
(the amount payable by Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)(ii)_,
which shall not exceed the Unwind Cap, the " _Unwind Reimbursement_ "). The
Company shall provide to Parent any updated calculation statements
and payment requests from the counterparties in respect of any such
termination payment for Elected Unwind Hedges.

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the Company shall
retain, pay, be responsible for, defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever
release Parent and its Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities or
obligations with respect to any Elected Retained Hedge; _provided_ , that,
(A) in the event Closing occurs, Parent shall be entitled to and responsible
for, as applicable, all revenues, gains, proceeds and liabilities related to
the Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby,
it being understood that all such

 



80

    

 revenues, gains and proceeds shall be the property of Parent; and (B) in the
event that this Agreement is terminated in compliance with and pursuant to
this  _Article_ __ _ IX,_ except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
9.4(e)(ii)_, (1) the Company shall be entitled to and responsible for, as
applicable, all revenues, gains, proceeds and liabilities related to
the Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby,
it being understood that all such revenues, gains and proceeds shall be the
property of the Company and (2) the Company shall not be entitled to any
remedy, and no Parent Related Party shall be liable to the Company for any
losses or expenses incurred by the Company, in each case with respect to, any
hedging transaction set forth in a Specified Hedging Agreement following such
termination.

 

(f) Any payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Unwind Reimbursement or
the Parent Termination Fee (or applicable portion thereof) will be made in
cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by
the recipient of such payment.

(g) Each Party will pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering
into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ __ that Parent will pay the filing fees
payable in connection with the filings required to be made under the HSR Act
and the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing
of any filing (other than the HSR Act filings) related to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon payment
of the Parent Termination Fee and/or the Unwind Reimbursement from Parent (if
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(e)_) or
from Sponsor or the Guarantors under the Guarantee in accordance with and
subject to the terms of the Guarantee: (a) such Parent Termination Fee and/or
Unwind Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company
Stockholders, each of their respective Affiliates and the
respective Representatives of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, the Debt Financing
Sources, Sponsor and each of the forgoing Persons former, current or future
Affiliates, portfolio companies, investment vehicles, controlling persons,
officers, directors, employees, equityholders, partners, members, managers,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for, and the Company Related Parties shall be deemed to
have waived all other remedies with respect to, any losses suffered as a
result of the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder, under the Commitment Letters or otherwise (in any case,
whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) and (b) none
of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further Liability relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein. No
Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring, and the Seller shall cause
all other Company Related Parties not to bring, and shall in no event support,
facilitate or encourage, the bringing of any Proceeding (under any legal
theory, whether sounding in law or in equity (in each case whether for breach
of contract, in tort or otherwise)) against a Parent Related Party with
respect to, arising out of, or in connection with, the failure of the Closing
to occur or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, under the
Commitment Letters or otherwise (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), other than a Proceeding to seek
to obtain the Parent Termination Fee and/or Unwind Reimbursement or
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief solely to the
extent

 



81

    

 provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, and the Company shall cause any such
Proceeding pending as of any termination of this Agreement to be dismissed
with prejudice as promptly as practicable after such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(h)_), if the Parent Termination Fee and/or the Unwind
Reimbursement is/are paid to the Company, under no circumstances will any
Company Related Party, or the Company Related Parties in the aggregate, be
entitled to monetary damages or monetary remedies for any claims, damages or
other losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in the Commitment Letters to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder
or for any representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee
and, under circumstances where it is required to be paid pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.4(e)_, the Unwind Reimbursement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(h)_ shall be in any way limit or modify
the rights of Parent and its Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letter or
the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

(i) Without limiting the foregoing, if the Company fails to effect the Closing
for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise), and in each case the Closing has not occurred, in no event shall
Parent seek or permit to be sought any monetary damages from the Company
in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

the Company seek or permit to be sought any monetary damages from any Parent
Related Party in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions

terminated in a manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Financing

to the Debt Commitment Letter.

or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions
hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.8  _Jurisdiction_.

the event, that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the action or
proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware). The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such claim is conclusive
and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law.

(b) Except as specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.13_,
each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in the chosen courts and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such claim in any such court.

10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS
THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY

CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY

Affiliate, director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager,
partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other Representative of any Party
hereto has any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



86

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Company agrees that
Company and Company Stockholders shall not have any claim against any Debt
Financing Source (or any of its respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, agents, Representatives,
Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, " _Debt Finance Related
Parties_ ")) nor shall any Debt Financing Source or any Debt Finance Related
Parties have any liability whatsoever to the Company or Company Stockholders,
in connection with the Debt Financing or in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in each case, whether arising, in
whole or in part, out of comparative, contributory or sole negligence by any
Debt Financing Source or Debt Finance Related Party. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) no amendment or modification to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_ (or amendment or modification with respect to any
related definitions as they affect this _Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_) shall be
effective without the prior written consent of each Debt Financing Source and
Debt Finance Related Party and (ii) each Debt Financing Source and Debt
Finance Related Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of, and
shall have the right to enforce, this _Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_. Each of the
Parties hereto agrees that  _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ shall apply in relation to
this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ with respect to Debt Financing Sources. This
_Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by
the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Finance Related Parties.

10.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
10.11(a)_ in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (a) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _
10.11(a)_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 10.11(a)_ or anything else to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger including
causing Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter (or any similar equity financing commitment) and the Equity Financing
contemplated therein by a decree of specific performance if, and only if, (i)
all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _
8.3_ (other than (x) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing (or are capable of being, and are reasonably expected

 



87

    

 to be, satisfied at the Closing) or (to the extent permissible under
applicable Law) waived in accordance with this Agreement or (y) those
conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of any material breach of
this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub) have been satisfied at the time when
the Closing would have occurred in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, (ii)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that it is ready, willing
and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
the full amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iv) the
Marketing Period has ended and Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete
the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee, provided that the
Company may commence Actions for both in the alternative. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto further agree that (1) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, a party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (2)
nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ shall require any party
hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _
10.11_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article_ __ _ IX_ (and pursuing the Parent Termination Fee after such
termination to the extent permitted in accordance with this Agreement), nor
shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 10.11_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ restrict or
limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of  _Article_ __ _ IX_.

10.12 _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, agreements
and covenants in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the terms of _Article_ __ _ I_ and this 
_Article_ __ _ X_, as well as the covenants and other agreements set forth in
this Agreement that by their terms apply, or that are to be performed in whole
or in part, after the Effective Time, shall survive the consummation of the
Merger. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the agreements
of the Parties in _Sections_ __ _ 7.5_, _9.2_ , _9.3_ and _9.4_ , and this
_Article_ __ _ X_ will survive such termination. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

10.13 _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the Parties: (a) agrees that all actions (whether in
law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter) entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder against the
Debt Financing Sources shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any
appellate court thereof and each Party irrevocably submits itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court, and such action (except to the extent relating to the interpretation
of any provisions in this Agreement (including any provision in the Debt
Commitment Letter or in any definitive documentation related to the Debt
Financing that expressly specifies that the interpretation of such provisions
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of
Delaware)) shall be governed by the Laws

 



88

    

 of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws, (b) agrees not to bring or
support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to bring or support any
action (whether in law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
the Debt Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment
Letter) entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder against any Debt Financing Source in any forum other than
any federal court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (c)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action in any such court, (d)
irrevocably and unconditionally waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury in any action brought
against the Debt Financing Sources directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder, (e) agrees that the Debt Financing
Sources are express third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_ and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 10.10(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.13_
(and any other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification
thereof would affect the substance of any of the foregoing) and (f) under no
circumstances shall any Party to this Agreement be entitled to recovery from
any Debt Financing Source any consequential, indirect, punitive, exemplary or
special damages arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Debt Financing.

A-2

    

_EIGHTH_

 

The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he, or a person
for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
an employee benefit plan (a " _Covered Person_ "), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, against all expenses,
liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with
such proceeding.

The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law
as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, pay the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; __ _ provided,_ __ _
however_, that to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of
expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made
only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts
advanced if it should be ultimately determined by final judicial decision
from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter, a " _final
adjudication_ ") that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified
under this _ Article EIGHTH_ or otherwise.

The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this _
Article EIGHTH_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and
administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _ Article
EIGHTH_, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses
to a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such Covered Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

If a claim for indemnification under this _ Article EIGHTH_ (following the
final disposition of such proceeding) is not paid in full within 60 days after
the Corporation has received a claim therefor by the Covered Person, or if a
claim for any advancement of expenses under this _ Article EIGHTH_ is not
paid in full within 30 days after the Corporation has received a statement or
statements requesting such amounts to be advanced, the Covered Person shall
thereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid
amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the Covered Person
shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim, or a claim
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law. In any such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that
the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or
advancement of expenses under applicable law. In (1) any suit brought by a
Covered Person to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a
suit

 



A-3

    

 brought by a Covered Person to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (2) in any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final adjudication that, the Covered Person has not met any applicable
standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit
that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances
because the Covered Person has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including
its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such
directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the Covered
Person has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Covered Person has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Covered Person, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Covered Person to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder,
or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant
to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Covered Person
is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under
this _ Article EIGHTH_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this _ Article EIGHTH_ shall
not be exclusive of any other rights that such Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the bylaws of the Corporation, any agreement or vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

This _ Article EIGHTH_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized
by appropriate corporate action.

 

Any Covered Person entitled to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses,
in each case pursuant to this _ Article EIGHTH_ may have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement and/or insurance provided by one or more persons
with whom or which such Covered Person may be associated. The Corporation
hereby acknowledges and agrees that (1) the Corporation shall be the
indemnitor of first resort with respect to any proceeding, expense, liability
or matter that is the subject of this _ Article EIGHTH_, (2) the Corporation
shall be primarily liable for all such obligations and any indemnification
afforded to a Covered Person in respect of a proceeding, expense, liability or
matter that is the subject of this _ Article EIGHTH_, whether created by law,
organizational or constituent documents, contract or otherwise, (3) any
obligation of any persons with whom or which a Covered Person may be
associated to indemnify such Covered Person and/or advance expenses or
liabilities to such Covered Person in respect of any proceeding shall be
secondary to the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (4) the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify each Covered Person and advance
expenses to each Covered Person hereunder to the fullest extent provided
herein without regard to any rights such Covered Person may have against any
other person with whom or which such Covered Person may be associated or
insurer of any such person and (5) the Corporation irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases any other person with whom or which a Covered
Person may be associated from any claim of contribution, subrogation or any
other recovery of any kind in respect of amounts paid by the Corporation
hereunder.

 



A-4

    

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any person who is or was serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
