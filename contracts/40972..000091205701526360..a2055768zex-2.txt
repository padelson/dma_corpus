Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("PARENT"), Radio Acquisition Corp.,
a Massachusetts corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the
Company have determined that the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
"MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, would be fair and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders;

         WHEREAS, such Boards of Directors have approved the Merger, pursuant to
which each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the
"COMPANY COMMON STOCK", other than shares owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company or any subsidiary (as defined in Section 8.04) of the Company or by
Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent, will be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.01(c));

         WHEREAS, the Merger and this Agreement require the vote of two-thirds
of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock for the approval thereof
(the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL");

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

applicable law.

         (b) At the Effective Time of the Merger, and without any further action
on the part of the Company or Sub, the By-Laws of Sub as in effect at the

forth in the articles of organization of Sub in effect immediately prior to the

                                   ARTICLE II

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
                            CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

         SECTION 2.01. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time of the
Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Sub, or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock of Sub:

         (a) COMMON STOCK OF SUB. Each share of common stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be
converted into one share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

         (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or by any
subsidiary of the Company, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash, Parent Common Stock
(as defined Section 2.01(c)) or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

         (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section
2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in and to the extent provided in
Section 2.04)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.1733 shares (the
"EXCHANGE RATIO") of Common Stock, par value $0.125 per share, of Parent (the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION").

         (d) CANCELLATION AND RETIREMENT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. As of the
Effective Time of the Merger, all shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock (collectively, the "CERTIFICATES") shall, to the extent
such Certificate represents such shares, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Common Stock, par value $0.125 per share, of Parent (the
"PARENT COMMON STOCK")) to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02.

         SECTION 2.02. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. As of the
Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such
bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT")
which shall provide that Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger, and
any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") issuable pursuant to Section
2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
whose shares were converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation (or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent, if any of such Certificates are
lost, stolen or destroyed) to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such holder), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.04, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time of the Merger to represent only the Parent Common Stock into which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted as provided in this Article II and the right to receive upon such
surrender cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by this Section 2.02.

         (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e) until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificate representing the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of any fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time of the Merger theretofore paid (but withheld
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time of the Merger and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

         (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

with the terms hereof, and all cash paid pursuant to Sections 2.02(c) and
2.02(e), shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

         (e) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu
of such issuance of fractional shares, Parent shall pay each holder of
Certificates an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)
the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the average of
the closing sale prices for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") Composite Transaction Tape for the ten trading days
immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time of the Merger.

         (ii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts
to such holders of Certificates, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
Section 2.02(c).

         (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02 which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates six months after the Effective
Time of the Merger shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Parent and only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which such holders may be entitled.

         (g) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time of the Merger, or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.01(d)),
any such Merger Consideration or cash shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

         (h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

         (i) ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS. In the event Parent changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to
the outstanding Parent Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time of the Merger,
Parent shall merge, be acquired or consolidate with, by or into any other
corporation (a "BUSINESS COMBINATION") and the terms thereof shall provide that
Parent Common Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any
other corporation or entity, then provision shall be made as part of the terms
of such Business Combination so that shareholders of the Company who would be
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Parent Common Stock
issuable to such shareholders as provided herein, the same kind and amount of
securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such Business Combination
with respect to one share of Parent Common Stock (provided that nothing herein
shall be construed so as to release the acquiring entity in any such Business
Combination from its obligations under this Agreement as the successor to
Parent).

         SECTION 2.03. TREATMENT OF OPTIONS. (a) At the Effective Time of the
Merger, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (a "COMPANY
STOCK OPTION") issued pursuant to the Company's 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, as
amended, 1991 Directors' Plan, as amended, 1994 Director Restricted Plan, as
amended, 1997 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Option Plan, as amended, 2001
Directors Stock Option Plan and Non-Statutory Stock Option Agreement by and
between Robert M. Dutkowsky and the Company dated April 24, 2000 (collectively,
the "COMPANY STOCK PLANS"), whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed to
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Option, the same number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as the holder of such Company Stock Option would have been entitled
to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, at a price per share
equal to (y) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (z) the
number of full shares of Parent Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such
Company Stock Option; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of any option to which
Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422
of the Code ("INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS"), the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code.

         (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to adjustments required by this
Section 2.03 after giving effect to the Merger and the provisions set


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

forth above). If necessary, Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company
Stock Plans and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions
of, the Company Stock Plans, that Company Stock Options that qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time of the Merger continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time of the Merger.

         (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Company Stock Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time of the Merger, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form, with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such options and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who subsequent to
the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), where
applicable, Parent shall administer the Company Stock Plans in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the
Company Stock Plans complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

         (d) The Company shall terminate the Company Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "COMPANY ESPP") at or prior to the Closing Date.

         SECTION 2.04. DISSENTING SHARES. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of any holder of Company Common Stock
who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights of such shares in accordance
with Massachusetts Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as
are granted by Massachusetts Law.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under Massachusetts Law shall
effectively withdraw the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time of the Merger and the occurrence of such event, such holder's
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive Parent Common Stock, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate representing such shares as provided in Section 2.01(c).

         (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Massachusetts Law and
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings which take
place prior to the Effective Time of the Merger with respect to demands for
appraisal under Massachusetts Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as may be required by applicable law, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of the Company Common
Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

which it is organized and has the requisite corporate power and authority to

its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would not have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.04) with respect to the
Company. The Company has delivered complete and correct copies of the Restated
Articles of Organization, as amended (the "Articles of Organization"), and
By-laws, as amended (the "By-laws"), of the Company as currently in effect. The

for the ownership interests set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock or other ownership interest in any corporation, partnership,
business association, joint venture or other entity.

paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. All securities
issued by the Company were issued in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable federal and state securities laws and all applicable rules and

may vote (collectively, "VOTING DEBT"). Except as set forth above, there are no
outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,

implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Except as set forth in Section
3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by the Company with the provisions
hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any breach or violation
of, or any default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of, or a "put"
right with respect to any obligation under, or to a loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under, (i) the Articles of

qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the

         (j) TAX MATTERS. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has taken any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code.

         (k) BROKERS. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
person, other than Goldman Sachs ("GOLDMAN SACHS"), the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by the Parent, is entitled to any broker's finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent. Parent agrees to indemnify the Company and to hold the
Company harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or obligations
with respect to any other fee, commission or expense asserted by any person on
the basis of any act or statement alleged to have been made by Parent or its
affiliates.

         (c) SEVERANCE. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall
grant any new or modified severance or termination arrangement or increase or
accelerate any benefits payable under its severance or termination pay policies
in effect on the date hereof.

         (d) WARN. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall

affiliates in advance and without complying with the notice requirements and
other provisions of WARN and any similar state or local law.

         (e) TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION TREATMENT. Neither Company nor Parent
shall, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to,
intentionally take or cause to be taken any action not otherwise consistent with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would reasonably be

Section 368(a) of the Code.


         (f) OTHER ACTIONS. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, or shall
permit any of its subsidiaries to, intentionally take any action that would, or
reasonably might be expected to, result in any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material
respect, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not
being satisfied; provided that the Company and its Board of Directors shall not
be required to take or be prohibited from taking any action to the extent that
such action is not required to be taken or is permitted, as applicable, pursuant
to Section 5.06 of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise
the other party orally and in writing of (i) any representation or warranty
becoming untrue in any material respect, (ii) the failure by such party to
comply with any covenant, condition or agreement hereunder and (iii) any event
which could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Article
VI not being satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such notice shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreement of the parties or the
conditions to their obligations hereunder.


                                    ARTICLE V

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 5.01. PREPARATION OF FORM S-4 AND PROXY STATEMENT; SHAREHOLDER
MEETING. (a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Each party will notify
the other party promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, or for any other
filing or for additional information and will supply the other party with copies
of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Form S-4, the


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

Proxy Statement, the Merger or any other filing. If the SEC requires a Tax
opinion in connection with the filing of the Form S-4, Company shall cause
Nutter, McClennen & Fish, LLP, counsel to Company, to provide such opinion in
the form required by the SEC. The issuance of such opinion shall be conditioned
upon the receipt by Nutter, McClennen & Fish, LLP, of customary representation
letters from each of Company, Parent and Sub in a form previously agreed to by
the parties. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any state in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the registration and qualification of the
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish
all information relating to the Company and its shareholders as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

         (b) Until such time as the Board of Directors of the Company takes any
of the actions with respect to a Transaction Proposal permitted pursuant to
Section 5.06 of this Agreement, all mailings to the Company's shareholders in
connection with the Merger, including the Proxy Statement, shall be subject to
the prior review, comment and approval of Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

         (c) The Company will, as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and in consultation with Parent, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "SHAREHOLDERS MEETING") for
the purpose of approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent required by Massachusetts Law. The Company will,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders approval of the
foregoing matters, as set forth in Section 3.01(p); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Board of Directors of the Company may fail to make or withdraw or modify such
recommendation, but only to the extent that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have concluded in good faith on the basis of advice from outside
counsel that such action is required in order to satisfy its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company under applicable law. Any such recommendation,
together with a copy of the opinion referred to in Section 3.01(o) shall be
included in the Proxy Statement. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to hold such meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 shall
have been declared effective.

         SECTION 5.02. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, officers, employees,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives to, afford to the other
party and its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours,
during the period prior to the Effective Time of the Merger to its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and, during such period,
each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries,
officers, employees and representatives to, furnish promptly to the other
documents filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal
or state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties, financial condition, operations and personnel as such other party
may from time to time reasonably request. Each of the Company and Parent will
hold, and

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

will cause its respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives and affiliates to hold, any
nonpublic information in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated June 25, 2001
between Parent and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

         (b) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall affect any
representations or warranties of the parties herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 5.03. REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. (a) Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) obtaining all consents, approvals, waivers, licenses,
permits or authorizations as are required to be obtained (or, which if not
obtained, would result in an event of default, termination or acceleration of
any agreement or any put right under any agreement) under any applicable law or
regulation or from any Governmental Entities or third parties in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) defending any lawsuits or
other proceedings challenging this Agreement and (iii) accepting and delivering
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and (iv) satisfying the conditions to closing set forth under
Article VI hereof.

         (b) In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and the Company agree to
file with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission a Notification and Report Form in accordance with
the notification requirements of the HSR Act, and to use their reasonable best
efforts to achieve the prompt termination or expiration of the waiting period or
any extension thereof provided for under the HSR Act as a prerequisite to the
consummation of the transactions provided for herein. Nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed as requiring any party to this Agreement or its affiliates to
(i) sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or voting securities other
than as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) take any action which
either would result in a Material Adverse Change in any such party.

         SECTION 5.04. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) From and after the Effective Time of
the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the Merger eligible
for indemnification pursuant to the Articles of Organization and By-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments, or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, pertaining to
any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
of the merger ("INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES") and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

hereby, in each case to the extent the Company or its subsidiaries would have
been permitted under its Articles of Organization and By-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) to indemnify such person. In the event any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified
Parties (whether arising before or after the Effective Time of the Merger), (i)
any counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties for any period after the
Effective Time of the Merger shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Parent;
(ii) after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Parent or Surviving Corporation
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; and (iii) after the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Parent and Surviving Corporation will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, provided that neither the Parent
not the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim
effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 5.04, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (but the failure so to notify the Surviving Corporation shall not
relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 5.04 except
to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Parent and Surviving
Corporation), and shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation the undertaking, if
any, required by Section 67 of Chapter 156B of the Massachusetts Law. The Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for the fees and expenses
hereunder with respect to only one law firm to represent the Indemnified Parties
as a group with respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the positions of any two
or more Indemnified Parties that would preclude or render inadvisable joint or
multiple representation of such parties.

         (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six years
from the Effective Time of the Merger directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage covering persons who are directors and officers of the
Company on the date of this Agreement, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, and containing terms and conditions which
are not less advantageous to such persons that the policies of the Company in
effect on the date hereof (the "COMPANY INSURANCE"); PROVIDED that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to spend in excess of 150% of the annual
premium for the Company Insurance paid by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the "CURRENT PREMIUM"); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Surviving
Corporation would be required to spend in excess of 150% of the Current Premium
to obtain insurance having terms not less advantageous than the Company
Insurance, the Surviving Corporation will be required to spend up to such amount
to maintain or procure as much insurance coverage as can be procured for such
premium.

         SECTION 5.05. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Neither Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will issue any press release or public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, without the other party's prior consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by applicable
law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any agreement with any
securities exchange or quotation system on which securities of the disclosing
party are listed or quoted. In addition to the foregoing, Parent, Sub and the
Company will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any such press release or other public
statements with respect to such transactions. The parties agree that

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior
to the issuance thereof.

         SECTION 5.06. NO SOLICITATION. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries), nor shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries
authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors, agents,
representatives, advisors or subsidiaries to, (a) solicit, initiate or take any
action knowingly to facilitate the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers
from any person (other than Sub or Parent) relating to (i) any acquisition or
purchase of 10% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries or of over 10% of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer (including a self tender offer)
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person (as defined in
Section 8.02) beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, sale of substantially all assets, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 10% of the consolidated assets of the Company other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) any other transaction the consummation
of which would or could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the Merger (collectively, "TRANSACTION PROPOSALS"),
or agree to or endorse any Transaction Proposal, or (b) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any of the forgoing, or
furnish to any other person any information with respect to its business,
properties or assets or any of the foregoing, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort
or attempt by any other person (other than Sub or Parent) to do or seek any of
the foregoing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
Company (either directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries) from (i) furnishing information pursuant to an appropriate
confidentiality letter (which letter shall not be less favorable to the Company
in any material respect than the Confidentiality Agreement between the Company
and Parent, and a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes
only to Parent) concerning the Company and its businesses, properties or assets
to a third party who has made a bona fide Transaction Proposal, (ii) engaging in
discussions or negotiations with such a third party who has made a bona fide
Transaction Proposal, (iii) following receipt of a bona fide Transaction
Proposal, taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or otherwise making
disclosure to its shareholders, (iv) following receipt of a bona fide
Transaction Proposal, failing to make or withdrawing or modifying its
recommendation referred to in Section 3.01(p), and/or (v) taking any action
required to be taken by the Company pursuant to a non-appealable, final order by
any court of competent jurisdiction, but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) only to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have concluded in good faith on the basis of
advice from outside counsel that such action is required in order to satisfy its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any
of the foregoing actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) until after
prompt advance notice to Parent (which notice shall in no event be given less
than two (2) business day prior to furnishing such information or entering into
such discussions) with respect to such action and that such Board of Directors
shall, to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties, continue to advise
Parent after

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

taking such action and, in addition, if the Board of Directors of the Company
receives a Transaction Proposal, then the Company shall promptly inform Parent
of the terms and conditions of such proposal and the identity of the person
making it. The Company will immediately cease and cause its advisors, agents and
other intermediaries to cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such parties
in possession of confidential information about the Company that was furnished
by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such information in the
possession of any such party or in the possession of any agent or advisor of any
such party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or restrict in any way
the Company's ability to negotiate (and consummate) the sale of its Advanced
Diagnostics Solutions division and all subsidiaries and assets associated
therewith consistent with Section 4.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 5.07. STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise
of Company Stock Options to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance.

         SECTION 5.08. LETTERS OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTANTS. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent public accountants, dated
a date within two business days before the Form S-4 shall become effective and a
letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated a date within two business days
before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent, for letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Form S-4.

         SECTION 5.09. LETTERS OF PARENT'S ACCOUNTANTS. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Parent's independent public accountants, dated a
date within two business days before the Form S-4 shall become effective and a
letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated a date within two business days
before the Closing Date, each addressed to the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

         SECTION 5.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Parent intends to include Company
employees in Parent's welfare plans (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA) and fringe benefit plans (the "Parent Plans") on the same basis and terms
as Parent employees not later than two years following the Effective Time and,
in any event, with respect to particular welfare plans of Parent, upon the
termination of the equivalent Company welfare plans; and until such time of
inclusion, Parent intends to cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect, on terms not materially less favorable to employees of the Company as
were in effect at the Effective Time of the Merger, all Company Plans which are
welfare plans or fringe benefits, other than employer stock option or stock
purchase plans. With respect to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who
remain as employees of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, Parent shall take into
account for

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

purposes of eligibility and vesting under such Parent Plans the service of such
employees with the Company or any subsidiary thereof as if such service were
with Parent or its subsidiaries, to the same extent to which such service would
have been credited under the applicable Parent plan and to the extent not
prohibited under such Parent Plan and consistent with Parent's policies. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent intends that
Company employees be eligible to participate in Parent's stock option and stock
purchase plans on the same basis and terms as Parent employees are eligible to
participate in such plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may at any time
terminate or modify the terms of any such Company Plans if the cost of
maintaining any such Company Plan has increased by a material amount or if, in
the good faith judgment of Parent, continuing to maintain any such Company Plan
conflicts in any material respect with Parent's overall compensation policies
then in effect. Nothing in this Section 5.10 will require that Parent permit
Company employees to participate in its defined benefit pension plan, which
Company and Parent understand is frozen to new accruals.

         SECTION 5.11. COMPANY SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. On or before the fifth
business day following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, satisfy the Company's outstanding obligations under
the Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of March 24, 2000, as
amended to date, with Fleet National Bank et al (the "Credit Facility
Agreement"); provided, however, that in no event shall Parent's obligation
hereunder exceed the sum of (a) with respect to the term loans outstanding under
the Credit Facility Agreement, an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount
included in the 2001 Balance Sheet less any scheduled payments made prior to the
Closing Date as set forth on Schedule 5.11 and (b) with respect to the revolving
credit facility under the Credit Facility Agreement, an aggregate amount not to
exceed the amount set forth on Section 4.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 5.12. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. The Company shall use its best
efforts to provide to Parent no later than September 3, 2001 all information
reasonably requested by Parent for Parent to determine (i) whether any payment
resulting from any agreement, contract, plan or other arrangement (separately or
in the aggregate) to which either the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party would be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code (without regard to the exceptions set forth in Sections 280G(b)(4)
and 280G(b)(5) of the Code) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) the amount of such excess parachute payments, if
any.

issuable or required to be reserved for issuance pursuant to this Agreement

<PAGE>

authorizations, qualifications, and orders of governmental authorities and other
third parties as are necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated

Entity or any other person or solely with respect to any Governmental Entity,
threatened y any suit, action, or proceeding, (i) challenging or seeking to

of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the following

Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except where the failure of

representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b)
(other than with respect to the delivery of the officers' certificates required

fifteen-day period provided Parent continues to exercise such commercially
reasonable effort.

         SECTION 7.02 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub, or the Company, other than the
provisions of Section 3.01(n), Section 3.02(k), the last sentence of Section
5.02(a), this Section 7.02, Section 8.02, and Section 8.07. Nothing contained in

<PAGE>

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights.

         SECTION 7.05. PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, EXTENSION, OR
WAIVER. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, an amendment
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 8.01. NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time of the Merger and
all such representations and warranties will be extinguished on consummation of
the Merger and neither the Company, the Parent, Sub, or any officer, director or
employee or shareholder of any of them shall be under any liability whatsoever
with respect to any such representation or warranty after such time. This
Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after Effective Time of the Merger.

fide intention to make a Transaction Proposal (including by making such a
Transaction Proposal) and (y) on or prior to August 1, 2002, the Company either
consummates with a Person a transaction the proposal of which would otherwise
qualify as a Transaction Proposal under Section 5.06 or enters into a definitive
agreement with a Person with respect to a transaction the proposal of which
would otherwise qualify as a Transaction Proposal under Section 5.06 (whether or
not such Person is the Person referred to in clause (x) above) other than a
transaction pursuant to which the Company or any of its affiliates issue
equity-related securities or Voting Debt to a Person in an aggregate amount of

termination of this Agreement shall affect any payment of fees or expenses due
and payable pursuant to this Agreement.

         (b) In addition to the other provisions of this Section 8.02, in the
event (i) a fee is or becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.02(a) hereof or (ii)

notice thereof, together with related bills or receipts, to reimburse Parent and
Sub for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
investment bankers and counsel and the expenses of litigation incurred in
connection with collecting the fee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section as
a result of any breach by the Company of its obligations under this Section
8.02; provided, however, that in the event the Company is obligated to reimburse
Parent pursuant to (b)(i) hereof, the Company's obligation to reimburse Parent
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses shall not exceed an
aggregate of $750,000.

         (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Parent shall pay all fees
relating to any filing required to be made in connection with the Merger under
the HSR Act or reasonably required to be made in connection with the Merger
under any similar law in any foreign jurisdiction; provided, however, that in
the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
