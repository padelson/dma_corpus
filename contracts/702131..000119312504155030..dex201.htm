<U>Construction</U>. The parties and their respective counsel have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In addition, each of the parties acknowledges that it is sophisticated and has been advised by experienced
counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in connection with the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The parties intend that each representation, warranty and
agreement contained in this Agreement will have independent significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty or agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or agreement relating to the
same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or agreement. Any reference to any
Law will be deemed to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The headings preceding the text of articles and sections included in this Agreement and the headings to the schedules and
exhibits are for convenience only and are not be deemed part of this Agreement or given effect in interpreting this Agreement. References to sections, articles, schedules or exhibits are to the sections, articles, schedules and exhibits contained
in, referred to or attached to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. The word &#147;including&#148; means &#147;including without limitation.&#148; The use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender or the singular or plural form of words
will not limit any provisions of this Agreement. A statement that an item is listed, disclosed or described means that it is correctly listed, disclosed or described, and a statement that a copy of an item has been delivered means a true and correct
copy of the writing has been delivered. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">23. <U>Time of
