WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each common share, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Share_ ") issued and outstanding

to recommend that Merger Subs sole shareholder approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Transactions;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the parties intend that the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Merger
Agreement, and in accordance with Section 104H of the Bermuda Companies Act,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Company_ ") as a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be fulfilled at
the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), at
the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto (the date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties will on or prior to the Closing Date (a) execute and deliver the
Statutory Merger Agreement, (b) cause an application for registration of the
Merger and the Surviving Company (the " _Merger Application_ ") to be

that the Registrar issue the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date at the time of day
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent and set forth in the Merger
Application. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of the
Certificate of Merger by the Registrar or such other time and date as the

ARTICLE II

 

 _CERTAIN GOVERNANCE MATTERS_

 

Section 2.1 _Board of Directors of Parent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall select four persons who shall
be proposed by the Company and be reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "
_Company Board Designees_ ") and Parent shall take all necessary actions to
cause the Company Board Designees to be appointed to the Board of Directors of
Parent immediately following the Effective Time. The Company Designees shall
be selected from among the directors of the Board of Directors of the Company
identified as independent in the Companys definitive proxy statement for its
most recent annual shareholders meeting preceding the Closing;  _provided_
that such Company Board Designee shall meet the criteria for service on the
Board of Directors of Parent under Applicable Law and NYSE rules, and any
criteria established by the Board of Directors of Parent or the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent for
such service that are generally applicable to members of the Board of
Directors of Parent.

 

(b) Effective as of immediately following the Effective Time and until the
annual meeting of shareholders of Parent in 2024 (or, if earlier, such time
that less than two Company Board Designees serve on the Board of Directors of
Parent), Parent shall take all necessary actions to cause each committee of
the Board of Directors of Parent (including any committee formed following
the Closing) to have at all times at least one Company Board Designee;
_provided_ that such Company Board Designee shall at all times during his or
her service on such committee meet the criteria for such service under
Applicable Law and NYSE rules, and any criteria established by the Board of
Directors of Parent, such committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Share Capital of the Company_.

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Shares and Merger Sub Common Shares_. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the parties or the holders of any Company Common Shares (or options
thereon):

(i) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_, each issued and outstanding Company
Common Share (other than any Dissenting Shares or any Company Common Shares to
be converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_) shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.2838 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Shares, together with cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares as specified below, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist. As of
the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share representing any Company Common Share shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender thereof,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

 

(ii) Each share of Merger Sub, par value $1.00 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each Company Common Share held in the
treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue or stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Shares or Parent Common Shares, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company Common
Shares or Parent Common Shares issued and outstanding after the execution of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Treatment of the Company Equity Awards_.

 

(i) Each Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a Parent restricted share unit award (" _Converted RSU Award_
") on the terms and conditions (including any continuing vesting
requirements; _provided_ that any continuing vesting requirements shall lapse
as of the Effective Time with respect to Company RSU Awards held by non-
employee directors of the Company) under the applicable plan, award agreement
and applicable deferral election in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, rounded up to the
nearest whole Parent Common Share, determined by multiplying the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that each such Company
RSU Award that constitutes "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section
409A of the Code shall be settled in accordance with the deferral election
applicable to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and in a manner that would not result in the application of additional
Taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Upon a Qualifying
Termination, the holder of a Converted RSU Award covered by this _Section_ __
_ 3.1(d)(i)_ will be entitled to full vesting of such Converted RSU Award.

 

(ii) Each Company PSU Award, other than any Final Cycle Company PSU Award,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a Converted RSU Award on the terms and conditions
(including any continuing service vesting requirements but excluding all
performance vesting conditions which shall lapse)) under the applicable plan
and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
modified by this Agreement, with respect to a number of Parent Common
Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole Parent Common Share, determined by
multiplying (A) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming target
performance) by (B) the Exchange Ratio (such product, with respect to each
such Company PSU Award, the (" _RSU Target Number_ ")). The actual number of
Parent Common Shares with respect to which each such Converted RSU Award
covered by this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)(ii)_ shall vest shall equal the
product determined by multiplying (A) the RSU Target Number by (B) the Vesting
Percentage.

 

(iii) Each Final Cycle Company PSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a
Parent performance share unit award (" _Converted PSU Award_ "), with respect
to a target number of Parent Common Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole
Parent Common Share, determined by multiplying (A) the number of Company
Common Shares subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming target performance) by (B) the Exchange Ratio (such
product, the " _PSU Target Number_ "). The Converted PSU Award

 



-5- 

    

 shall be subject to the same performance vesting opportunities and
performance goals applicable to performance share unit awards granted by
Parent in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. The actual number of
Parent Common Shares with respect to which each such Converted PSU Award shall
vest shall be determined based on actual performance, subject to the
applicable holder remaining employed with Parent and its Subsidiaries through
February1, 2024, if the Effective Time occurs in 2021 or February 1, 2025, if
the Effective Time occurs in 2022; _provided, however,_ that if the holder of
the applicable Converted PSU Award experiences a Qualifying Termination prior
to February 1, 2024, if the Effective Time occurs in 2021 or February1, 2025,
if the Effective Time occurs in 2022, the holder of such Converted PSU Award
will be entitled to full service-vesting of such Converted PSU Award
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any such award that,
prior to conversion, was a "partner unit plan" Company PSU Award), and the
number of shares with respect to which such Converted PSU Award shall vest
shall equal the PSU Target Number.

(iv) Each Company DSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent deferred
share unit award on the terms and conditions under the applicable plan, award
agreement and applicable deferral election in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, with the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares covered by such Parent deferred share
unit award, rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying
the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company DSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that
each such Company DSU Award that constitutes "deferred compensation" for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code shall be settled in accordance with the
deferral election applicable to such Company DSU Award as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and in a manner that would not result in the
application of additional Taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code.

(v) Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into an option to purchase (A) the number of Parent Common
Shares equal to the product determined by _multiplying_ (1) the number of
Company Common Shares subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (2) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Common Share, at (B) an exercise
price per Parent Common Share equal to (1) the per share exercise price for
Company Common Shares subject to the corresponding Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (2) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each such option shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company Option under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms.

 



-6- 

    

(vi) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume (A) the Company
RSU Awards, Company Options, Company PSU Awards and Company DSU Awards that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __
_ 3.1(d)_ and (B) sponsorship of each Company Equity Plan, _provided_ that
references to the Company therein shall thereupon be deemed references to

take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient

(e) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Dissenting Share shall be, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law, converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(e)(ii)_ or the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section

written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to exercise
appraisal rights in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act, or agree or
commit to do any of the foregoing. Payment of any amount payable to holders
of Dissenting Shares shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder services
provider (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging, in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
for the Merger Consideration. In addition, at or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Shares evidence of Parent
Common Shares representing the aggregate amount of Parent Common Shares
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration (such shares,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
hereinafter, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ out of the
Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and
outstanding Company Common Shares and whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that
number of whole Parent Common Shares and/or cash, as applicable, that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_
__ _ III_, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration of such Merger Consideration that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of such registration in the name of a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

 



-11- 

    

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to any Parent Common Shares
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_, in each case
until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with
this  _Article_ __ _ III_. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall
be paid to the holder of Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_ __ and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent
Common Shares. Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed prior to the first anniversary of
the Effective Time additional cash sufficient to pay any amounts to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_. 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. All Parent Common
Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to Company Common Shares, theretofore represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and,
subject to compliance with the procedures in  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_,
exchanged as provided in this _Article_ __ _ III_, except as otherwise
provided by Applicable Law.

 

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Common Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after
taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of
(i) the number of full Parent Common Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent for issuance to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares over (ii)
the aggregate number of full Parent Common Shares to be distributed to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (such excess being herein referred to as
the " _Excess Shares_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE,
all in the manner provided herein.

 



-12- 

    

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of
any such sale or sales of Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any
expenses, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or
sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to
which each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if
any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest
to which such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after
taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such
holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly
pay such amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares is not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange
contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this  _Article_ __ _ III_ shall thereafter be
entitled to look only to Parent for payment of their claim for any Parent
Common Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, or any of their respective affiliates, shall
be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Parent Common Shares, any cash in lieu
of fractional Parent Common Shares or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Shares in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests
of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



-13- 

    

(h) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ , that no
losses on such investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of
Company Common Shares pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law. Parent shall provide the Company with
written notice promptly after Parent determines that any such withholding
(other than in the case of any "backup withholding" pursuant to Section 3406
of the Code and the corresponding Treasury Regulations and any withholding in
connection with consideration payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ or
otherwise of a compensatory nature) is or may be required and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to reduce or
eliminate such withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Entity and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect
to Company Common Shares formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on
Parent Common Shares deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on or prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference
to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being
taken ( _provided_ , that such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that
particular subsection and such other subsections of this Agreement to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other subsections), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize
such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries,
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has delivered to or made available to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement true and complete copies of any amendments to
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate of
Incorporation_ "), the Memorandum of Association of the Company (the "
_Company Memorandum of Association_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bye-laws
of the Company (the " _Company Bye-Laws_") not filed as of the date of this
Agreement with the Company Filed SEC Documents. The Company is not in
violation in any material respect of any of the terms of the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, Company Memorandum of Association or Company
Bye-Laws.

 

(b) _Corporate Authority; Non-contravention_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and, subject to the
Company Shareholder Approval and the filing of the Merger Application with the
Registrar, to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, subject (in the case of the Merger) to the Company
Shareholder Approval and the filing of the Merger Application with the
Registrar. The Board of Directors of the Company (at a meeting duly called and
held) has, by the unanimous vote of all directors of the Company: (a)
determined that the Exchange Ratio constitutes fair value for the Company
Common Shares in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act; (b) determined
that entering this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and
consummating the Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company; (c) approved

Parent, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,

performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought (collectively, the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ").

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger
Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Transactions and
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger
Agreement shall not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss
of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any pledge, claim, lien,
charge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ ") upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, under (A) the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, Company Memorandum of Association or the Company Bye-laws or
the comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, (B) any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, trust document,

Transactions.

to the management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

delivered by Parent to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ ,
that such disclosure shall be deemed to qualify that particular subsection and

the case may be, and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the other subsidiaries of

Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, under (A) the Parent Certificate of Incorporation or the Parent
Bylaws or the comparable organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries,

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,

(c) _Other Actions_. Except as required by law, during the period from the

_Article_ __ _ VII_.

(d) _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(i) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees and Representatives to, cooperate in
good faith to implement any necessary, appropriate or desirable arrangements
in connection with the Companys and its subsidiaries credit facilities,
indentures or other documents governing or relating to indebtedness with
respect to any financing matters related to the Transactions, including,
without limitation, the repayment of indebtedness under, and termination of,
the Companys credit facilities upon Closing and any Debt Offers, or similar
transactions in connection with the Companys debt securities, in each case,
so long as the effectiveness of such arrangements is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger.

(ii) In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent) will
be permitted, in consultation with the Company, to commence and conduct
offers to purchase or exchange, and conduct consent solicitations with respect
to, any or all of the outstanding series of senior notes of the Company (the "
_Company Notes_ "), the consummation or completion of which shall be
conditioned upon the Closing and which offers to purchase or exchange or
consent solicitations shall have such other terms and conditions, including
pricing terms and amendments to the terms and provisions of the applicable
indenture, as are specified, from time to time, by Parent in consultation with
the Company (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ ")
and which are permitted by the terms of such Company Notes, the applicable
indentures and applicable Law, including the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent) shall not be permitted to commence any Debt
Offer unless Parent shall have provided the Company with the necessary offer
to purchase, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal or press
release, if any, in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the " _Debt
Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the
applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its counsel to review and
comment on such Debt Offer Documents (which comments shall be considered in
good faith by Parent). Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder
consents, in connection with any or all of the consent solicitations, the
Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Companys indentures in

 



-59- 

    

 accordance with the terms thereof amending the terms and provisions thereof
as described in the applicable Debt Offer documents in a form as reasonably
requested by Parent; _provided_ that the amendments effected by such
supplemental indentures shall be conditioned upon, and shall not become
operative until, the Closing. In connection with any such Debt Offers, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) deliver and to cause counsel
for the Company to deliver, customary legal opinions, to the extent such
opinions would not conflict with Applicable Law and would be accurate in light
of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered and (ii) cause
the Companys independent accountants to provide customary consents for use
of their reports to the extent required in connection with any Debt Offers.
The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other
agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers will be selected by Parent
after consultation with the Company and their fees and out-of-pocket expenses
will be paid directly by Parent. 

(iii) The Company acknowledges and agrees that it may be necessary for Parent
and its subsidiaries to enter into financing transactions (including, without
limitation, the raising of new financing, the refinancing of existing
indebtedness, the retirement, prepayment or redemption of existing
indebtedness, producing amendments, amendment and restatements,
modifications, waivers or consents in relating to existing indebtedness
and/or launch and consummating the Debt Offers) (any such transaction, a "
_Financing Transaction_ "). In connection with any Financing Transaction, the
Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Representatives to, cooperate and use its
and their reasonable best efforts to provide such information and
documentation as may be necessary or reasonably desirable in connection with
the structuring, marketing and execution of any Financing Transaction,
including (A) participating in meetings and due diligence sessions and rating
agency presentations in connection with the Financing Transaction and
preparing materials in connection therewith, (B) assisting with the
preparation of any portion of the disclosure in relation to the Financing
Transaction that relates to the Merger or the Transactions (including any
historical and pro forma financial information and operational data), (C)
executing and delivering any pledge and security document, guarantees,
indentures, other definitive financing documents, and other certificates or
documents and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested (provided such
documents will not take effect until the Effective Time) and (D) delivering,
or procuring the delivery of, such information, certificates, authorization
letters, comfort letters, representation letters and other documents as
may be necessary or desirable (including, without limitation, any investment
or commercial banks appointed in any capacity with respect to any Financing
Transaction). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, but excluding the costs of the Companys preparation of its
annual and quarterly financial statements and any amount in respect of such
costs and expenses for which the Company (or, if relevant, any member of a
group for VAT purposes of which it is a member) is entitled to credit as input
tax) incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective
representatives in connection with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ (including
such Financing Transaction).

 



-60- 

    

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
5.1(d)_, the Company shall not be required to (x) enter into any Financing
Transaction prior to the Effective Time that is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger or (y) disclose any information pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ to the extent that (A) in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Company, any Applicable Law requires the Company or its
subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such information, (B) in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, the information is subject
to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of any such
information or document would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to clauses (A) through
(C) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)(iv)_, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the required consent of any
third party necessary to provide such disclosure, (2) develop an alternative
to providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent and (3) utilize the procedures of a
joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if the parties
determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating Applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.

 

(v) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and
their respective officers, directors, employees and Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them of any type (other than to the extent resulting from
information provided to Parent in writing by the Company or its subsidiaries)
in connection with the Companys obligations under this _Section_ __ _
5.1(d)_, except in the event that such loss, damage, claim, cost or expense
arises out of or results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith by the Company or its subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_.

 

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (each, a "
_Representative_ ") retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly take any other
action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of,
any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Company Alternative
Transaction or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or
cooperate in any way with any person (or group of persons), with respect to
any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Company Alternative Transaction, except to notify
such person (or group of persons) as to the existence of the

 



-61- 

    

 provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that any such proposal that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _
5.2(d)_, the Company and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person (or group of
persons) making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources)
( _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time
it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms (including as to confidentiality and "standstill"
terms) generally no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 19, 2020, as amended, entered into between the
Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") ( _provided_ that
such "standstill" terms may be waived by the Board of Directors of the
Company if it determines, in consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal with the person (or group of persons)
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources). For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Transaction_ " means any
of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person
(or group of persons) or its or their equityholders, other than Parent and its
subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), (such person (or group of persons) or its
or their equityholders, a " _Company Third Party_ "), acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the issued and outstanding
Company Common Shares or securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company, whether from the
Company or pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, share exchange, scheme of arrangement, combination or otherwise
or (ii) any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any
Company Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries
of the Company or any entity surviving any merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, share exchange, scheme of arrangement or combination including
any of them) or businesses of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case
on a consolidated basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, whether from the Company or pursuant to a merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, share exchange, scheme of arrangement, combination or otherwise.

 

(b) ______Except as permitted by _Section 5.2(c)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of
the Merger or this Agreement or the Statutory Merger Agreement, (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company
Alternative Transaction (any action in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being

 



-62- 

    

 referred to as a " _Company Recommendation Change_ "), or (iii) cause or
permit the Company or any of its controlled affiliates to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement related to any Company Alternative Transaction or requiring, or
reasonably likely to cause, the Company to terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent
with, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_).

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after it has received a Company Superior Proposal
(and after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and
the following sentences) effect a Company Recommendation Change, but only at a
time that is after the fourth business day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
the Company has received a Company Superior Proposal specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal (and a copy of such
proposal if in writing), identifying the person making such Company Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Company Recommendation Change;
_provided_ that in the event of any subsequent modification to the material
terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors
of the Company may only effect a Company Recommendation Change, after the
later of (x) the fourth business day following Parents receipt of the
initial written notice advising Parent of the Company Superior Proposal and
(y) the second business day following Parents receipt of written notice from
the Company advising Parent of the modification to such terms and conditions;
_provided_ _further_ that during such four or two business day notice period,
as applicable, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the proposal to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction no longer
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Company Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on
its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by
a Company Third Party to enter into a Company Alternative Transaction (with
all references to 20% in the definition of Company Alternative Transaction
being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not
result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_, (B) is on terms that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to the
Companys shareholders than the Transactions, taking into account all relevant
factors (including any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by
Parent in response to such proposal to enter into a Company Alternative
Transaction and the identity of the person making such proposal to enter into
a Company Alternative Transaction), and (C) is reasonably likely to be
completed on its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such proposal.

 

(d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_, the Company shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours of receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of any request
for information or of any proposal relating to a Company Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
(including any changes thereto and, if in writing, a copy of such proposal)
and the identity of the person making such request or proposal. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
proposal on a current basis and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written materials exchanged between the Company or its subsidiaries or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such
request or proposal, on the other hand, in each case that describes in any
material respect any of the material terms or conditions of any such request
or proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, but only at a time that is after
the fourth business day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
make a Company Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening
Event and specifying in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that
render a Company Recommendation Change necessary; provided that during such
four business day notice period the Company engages (to the extent requested
by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement and
after such four business day notice period, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to
effect a Company Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any material
Effect occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not
known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material consequences of which were
not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case to the Board of Directors or
executive officers of the Company as of or prior to the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any Company Alternative
Transaction; provided that (A) in no event shall any action taken by the
parties pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.3_, or the consequences of any such action, constitute, be deemed to
contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Company Intervening Event and (B)in no event shall any Effect that
would fall within any of the exceptions to the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure
of its position thereunder and (ii) making any required disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure or
statement that constitutes or contains or would reasonably be likely to have
the effect of a Company Recommendation Change shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_.

(g) The Company agrees that in the event any of its controlled affiliates or
any officer, director, employee or Representative of the Company or any of its
controlled affiliates acting on behalf of the Company or any of its controlled
affiliates takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, the Company shall be deemed to be in
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 

(a) Parent shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representative retained by
it or any of its controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
would constitute a Parent Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person (or
group of persons), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of,
any proposal the consummation of which would constitute a Parent Alternative
Transaction, except to notify such person (or group of persons) as to the
existence of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result from a
material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, Parent and its Representatives may
(A) furnish information with respect to Parent and its subsidiaries to the
person (or group of persons) making such proposal (and its Representatives and
financing sources) (provided that all such information has previously been
provided to the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms (including as to
confidentiality and "standstill" terms) generally no less restrictive than
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such "standstill"
terms may be waived by the Board of Directors of Parent if it determines, in
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations

(including any changes thereto and, if in writing, a copy of such proposal)

shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal
on a current basis and (ii) provide to the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence

or proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Recommendation
Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, but only at a time that is after the fourth business day
following the Companys receipt of written notice from Parent

 advising the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent intends to make a
Parent Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event and
specifying in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that render a
Parent Recommendation Change necessary; provided that during such four
business day notice period Parent engages (to the extent requested by the
Company) in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement
and after such four business day notice period, the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to
effect a Parent Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means any material Effect
occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that (i) was not known
or reasonably foreseeable, or the material consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case to the Board of Directors or

and (ii) does not relate to or involve any Parent Alternative Transaction;
provided that (A) in no event shall any action taken by the parties pursuant
to the affirmative covenants set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, or the
consequences of any such action, constitute, be deemed to contribute to or
otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Parent
Intervening Event and (B) in no event shall any Effect that would fall within
any of the exceptions to the definition of " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit Parent
from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure
of its position thereunder and (ii) making any required disclosure to the
shareholders of Parent if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure or statement that
constitutes or contains or would reasonably be likely to have the effect of a
Parent Recommendation Change shall be subject to the provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 5.3(b)_.

(g) Parent agrees that in the event any of its controlled affiliates or
any officer, director, employee or Representative of Parent or any of its
controlled affiliates acting on behalf of Parent or any of its controlled
affiliates takes any action that, if taken by Parent, would constitute a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, Parent shall be deemed to be in breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company or
Parent to disclose any information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ to

by the other party hereto. Each of the Company and Parent shall hold, and
shall cause its respective affiliates, officers, employees and Representatives

_Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ ").

(b) The parties shall jointly develop, and each of the parties shall consult

actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or in respect
of any acts or omissions in their capacities as such directors of officers

(or substitute insurance policies) of the Company in respect of any one policy

insurance for the twelve months prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "), and if Parent or the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount in respect of each policy year
within such period;  _provided_ that in lieu of the foregoing, the Company
may, in consultation with Parent, obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a
six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the Maximum Amount.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ (i) shall survive consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified

attempting to minimize the amount of such Taxes.

 

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, or shall cause one
of its subsidiaries (including the Company) to honor, all contractual
obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and Parent Benefit Plans
(including, without limitation, and in accordance with the terms thereof, the
arrangements identified on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as
applicable). Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of twelve
months thereafter, Parent shall provide to each employee of the Company and

provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries) providing benefits
to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), and
subject to Applicable Law, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company, Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries, as the case may be, before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plans or Parent
Benefit Plans, as applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits and except for benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject to any Applicable Law: (i) each Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans which are welfare benefit plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, as applicable, in which such Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee, Parent or the

 



-75- 

    

 Company, as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for

(f)

member of any VAT group of which it is a member shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to secure that any Termination Fee payable under this Section 8.2 will
not be subject to any VAT and (ii) pay the full amount of any such Termination
Fee free and clear of any deduction or adjustment pursuant to the following
Section 8.2(f)(ii).

 



-84- 

    

(ii) If:

 

(A) a Taxing Authority (or, following an appeal to a court or tribunal, such
court or tribunal) finally determines that any payment of the Termination
Fees constitutes all or part of the consideration for a supply made for VAT
purposes in respect of which the recipient of the sum (or the representative
member of the VAT group of which the recipient of the sum is a member) is
liable to account for VAT, to the extent that such VAT is recoverable by the
payor of the sum (or the representative member of the VAT group of which the
payor is a member) by way of repayment or credit as input tax, the amount of
the sum shall be increased to such amount so that the amount of the sum
(including any amount in respect of VAT), less the amount of such repayment or
credit in respect of input tax equals the amount of the sum had no such VAT
arisen; for the avoidance of doubt if and to the extent that such VAT is
irrecoverable by the payor (or the representative member of the VAT group of
which the payor is a member) then no additional amount shall to that extent be
paid in respect of such VAT and the sum shall, to that extent, be VAT
inclusive; and

(B) a Taxing Authority (or, following an appeal to a court or tribunal, such
court or tribunal) finally determines that any payment of the Termination
Fees constitutes all or part of the consideration for a supply made for VAT
purposes in respect of which the payor of the sum (or the representative
member of the VAT group of which the payor is a party) is liable to account

Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of

shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ below,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

America sitting in Delaware, and appellate courts thereof. Service of
process, summons, notice or document to any partys address and in the manner
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall be effective service of process for
