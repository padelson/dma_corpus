 3.2 _Conversion of Common Stock; Cancellation of Series A Preferred Stock_. 

   

 (a) At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Common Stock, the following shall occur: 

   

 (i) _Conversion Generally_. At the Merger Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive: 

   

 (A) the Per Share Amount at Closing, which aggregate amount per share of Common Stock shall be payable, subject to _Section 3.9_, in the form of (x) a cash payment equal to the product of the Per Share Amount at Closing _multiplied_  by the Purchase Price Cash Component, which cash payment shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds, without interest, (y) such number of shares of Parents Stock having a value (with each share valued using the Parent Stock Value) equal to the product of the Per Share Amount at Closing _multiplied_ by the Purchase Price Stock Component; and 

   

 (B) following the Closing, its pro rata share of any distributions to be made to the Stockholders from the Escrow Funds. 

   

Upon such conversion, all such shares of Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right
to receive the consideration specified in this  _Section 3.2(a)(i)_. 

   

 (ii) _Parent-Owned Shares_. Any shares of Common Stock owned by the Parent or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no merger consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Each share of Common Stock held in the Company treasury immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no merger consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (iv) _Merger Sub_. Upon the consummation of the Merger, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so represented, and the shares so represented shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Series A Preferred Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Preferred Liquidation Amount payable without interest pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_. Upon such conversion, all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the consideration specified in this  _Section 3.2(b)_. 

  

 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates for Common Stock_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and the Parent shall send to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing outstanding shares of Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in such form and having such provisions reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Stockholders Representative and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the merger consideration payable in respect of the number of Shares represented by such Certificates. At the Merger Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Parent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable type and portion of the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Such payment of the applicable portion of the merger consideration shall be paid to such holder by the Parent (i) on the Closing Date, if such holder has on or prior to the Merger Effective Time delivered to the Parent such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, or (ii) within two (2) Business Days from the delivery of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, if such Certificate and letter of transmittal are delivered following the Closing Date. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any merger consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the merger consideration payable in respect of such shares of Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Common Stock is presented to the Parent, accompanied by all documents required to 

   ##### 

  

 

evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable portion of the merger consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate, without any
interest thereon;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no certificates representing
less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates by any holder thereof pursuant to this _Section
3.3(a)_. Any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to
this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall be converted into cash at the Parent Stock
Value. 

   

 (b) _Further Rights in Common Stock_. The merger consideration issued upon conversion of a share of Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Common Stock (other than any rights such holder may have to receive its pro rata share of any distributions to be made to the Stockholders from the Escrow Funds). 

  

 (c) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Common Stock for any cash or shares of Parents Stock from the merger consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates have not been surrendered prior to five years after the Closing (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any merger consideration in respect of those Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any merger consideration payable in respect of those Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled to that merger consideration. 

  

 (d) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond (other than the Institutional Stockholders), in such reasonable amount as the Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Parent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon. 

  

 3.4 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. Subject to _Section 3.3(c)_ , at or after the Merger Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Parent for any reason shall be exchanged for the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificates, without any interest thereon. 

       ##### 

  

     

 3.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may also include any amounts payable into or out of the Escrow Account) such amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 3.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a statement (the " _Statement_ ") of the Company Net Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses. 

  

 (b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date on which the Statement was delivered to the Stockholders Representative, unless the Stockholders Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Parent prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the Parent in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Stockholders and the Parent on the earlier of (i) the date the Stockholders Representative and the Parent resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 3.6(b)_. During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Stockholders Representative and the Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such thirty (30)-day period the Stockholders Representative and the Parent have not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Stockholders Representative and the Parent shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 3.6(b)_, only such matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be KPMG LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the Stockholders Representative and the Parent in writing. The Stockholders Representative and the Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute were properly included or omitted and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the Stockholders Representative and the Parent and their respective representatives and not by independent review and shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court 

   ##### 

  

 

having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to
this _Section 3.6(b)_ shall be borne pro rata as between the Stockholders,
on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand, in proportion to the
final allocation made by such Accounting Firm of the disputed items weighted
in relation to the claims made by the Stockholders Representative and the
Parent, such that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of such
fees, costs and expenses. 

   

 (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Company Net Indebtedness_ " means the Company Net Indebtedness, " _Final Preferred Liquidation Amount_ " means the Preferred Liquidation Amount, and " _Final Company Expenses_ " means the Company Expenses, in each case as finally agreed or determined in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased (any such increase, the " _Stockholder Adjustment Amount_ ") by the  _sum_ of (i) the amount, if any, that the Estimated Company Net Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Final Company Net Indebtedness, (ii) the amount, if any, that the Preferred Liquidation Amount set forth in the Closing Certificate exceeds the Final Preferred Liquidation Amount, and (iii) the amount, if any, that the Company Expenses set forth in the Closing Certificate exceeds the Final Company Expenses. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be decreased (any such decrease, the " _Parent Adjustment Amount_ ") by the _sum_ of (i) the amount, if any, that the Final Company Net Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Company Net Indebtedness Amount, (ii) the amount, if any, that the Final Preferred Liquidation Amount exceeds the Preferred Liquidation Amount set forth in the Closing Certificate, and (iii) the amount, if any, that the Final Company Expenses exceeds the Company Expenses set forth in the Closing Certificate. If the Stockholder Adjustment Amount exceeds the Parent Adjustment Amount, the Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Company Net Indebtedness, the Final Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Final Company Expenses are determined, subject to _Section 3.9_, make payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Stockholder Percentage in the amount of any such excess. If the Parent Adjustment Amount exceeds the Stockholder Adjustment Amount, the Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Company Net Indebtedness, the Final Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Final Company Expenses are determined, cause the Escrow Agent to release to Parent a number of shares of Parents Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement having a value (with each share of Parents Stock valued at the Parent Stock Value) equal to such excess. 

  

 (d) No actions taken by the Parent on its own behalf or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on or following the Closing Date shall be given effect for purposes of determining the Company Net Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the final determination and payment of Company Net Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses in accordance with this _Section 3.6_, the Parent shall afford, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to afford, to the Stockholders and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by the Stockholders in connection with the review of Company Net Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses in accordance with this  _Section 3.6_, direct access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel, representatives (including the Companys accountants) and records of the Company, each Company Subsidiary and such representatives (including the work papers of the Companys accountants) relevant to 

   ##### 

  

 

the review of the Statement and the Parents determination of Company Net
Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses in
accordance with this _Section 3.6_. 

   

 3.7 _Treatment of Options and Aggregate Option Consideration_. 

   

 (a) The Company immediately before the Closing shall take all actions necessary so that each Optionholder of each Option then outstanding and unexercised has a fully vested right to exercise such Option (each an " _Outstanding Option_ "), and Parent effective at the Closing shall assume and adopt the Company Stock Option Plan (the Company Stock Option Plan as so assumed and adopted being the " _New Company Plan_ ") and substitute shares of Parent Stock for shares of Common Stock, the number of which shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Stock available for issuance under the Company Stock Option Plan immediately before the Closing by the Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock. 

  

 (b) Each Optionholders right to purchase Common Stock under each Outstanding Option (or part of an Outstanding Option) under the Company Stock Option Plan that is designated as a "Roll Over Option" pursuant to the formula set forth on _Schedule 3.7_ shall be assumed by the Parent at the Closing, and Parent effective at the Closing shall convert each such Outstanding Option (or part of an Outstanding Option) into a fully vested option to purchase Parent Stock under the New Company Plan in accordance with _Section 3.7(d)_ (each so converted Outstanding Option (or part of an Outstanding Option) being a " _Roll Over Option_ ", and the holder of each such Roll Over Option being a " _Roll Over Optionholder_ "). 

  

 (c) Parent, at the Closing, shall pay to each Optionholder an amount in cash equal to the Per Option Consideration, if any, with respect to each Outstanding Option (other than a Roll Over Option) held by such Optionholder, and the aggregate amount of such payments shall be the " _Aggregate Cash Option Consideration_ ". Each Optionholders right to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any Outstanding Option shall (subject to _Section 3.7(b)_) be cancelled effective at the Closing and shall have no further force or effect whatsoever. 

  

 (d) With respect to each Roll Over Optionholder, effective as of the Closing: 

   

 (i) Each Roll Over Option shall represent a fully vested right to acquire the number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parents Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to the related Outstanding Option (or the applicable part of the related Outstanding Option) immediately before the Closing _multiplied_ by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional share resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per Share of each Roll Over Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by _dividing_ (i) the exercise price per Share under the related Outstanding Option immediately prior to the Closing by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). 

   

 (ii) If the conversion of an Outstanding Option (or part of an Outstanding Option) into a Roll Over Option described in _Section 3.7(d)(i)_ involves a 

   ##### 

  

    

fractional share of Parent Stock which is rounded down to the nearest whole
share of Parent Stock, Parent shall pay the affected Roll Over Optionholder
an amount equal to the Parent Stock Value multiplied by the fractional share,
rounded to two decimal places, and such payment shall be made at the same
time payments are made pursuant to  _Section 3.7(c)_. 

   

 (iii) The term " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Optionholder Per Share Amount by (ii) Parent Stock Value. 

   

 (iv) The terms of each Roll Over Option shall (except as necessary or appropriate to reflect the conversion and as consistent with the regulations under Section 409A of the Code) be the same as the terms of the related Outstanding Option immediately prior to the Closing, including the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the applicable award agreement for the related Outstanding Option. Promptly after the Closing, the Parent shall cause the Roll Over Options to be registered under a Form S-8 registration statement of the Parent filed under the Securities Act. The Roll Over Optionholder shall not be entitled to any additional benefits or be subject to any additional restrictions that he or she did not have under his or her related Outstanding Option. 

  

 (e) The term " _Aggregate Option Consideration_ " shall mean the aggregate of the Per Option Consideration related to each Outstanding Option (including an option which is converted into a Roll Over Option), and the " _Per Option Consideration_ " for each Outstanding Option (including an option which is converted into a Roll Over Option) shall be an amount equal to the product of (I) the excess, if any, of (i) the Optionholder Per Share Amount over (ii) the Exercise Price for such Outstanding Option, _multiplied_ by (II) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Outstanding Option. The " _Optionholder Per Share Amount_ " equals the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) (x) the Estimated Purchase Price (without reduction for the Aggregate Option Consideration or the Escrow Amount) plus (y) the aggregate Exercise Price for all Outstanding Options (including options which are converted into Roll Over Options) by (B) the sum of (1) the total number of Shares and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to all Outstanding Options (including options which are converted into Roll Over Options);  _provided_ that if this calculation results in an Optionholder Per Share Amount being less than the Exercise Price of any of the Outstanding Options, then the same calculation should be repeated but only those Outstanding Options with Exercise Prices less than the Optionholder Per Share Amount produced in the first calculation shall be included in such subsequent calculation, including for the purposes of clauses (A)(y) and (B)(2) thereof. 

  

 (f) To the extent permissible by applicable law, the Stockholders and the Parent shall treat, and cause their Affiliates to treat, the U.S. federal and state income tax deductions resulting from (i) the payment obligations of the Company in cancellation of the Options described in this  _Section 3.7_ (other than Roll Over Options), (ii) the U.S. federal and state income tax deductions resulting from the accrual or payment of any Indebtedness (including the deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Indebtedness repaid at or before Closing) and (iii) Company Expenses, to the extent deductible, as deductible in the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period, and, in the case of a Straddle Period, as allocable for the purposes of this Agreement to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period included in 

   ##### 

  

 

such Straddle Period, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders and the Parent shall not treat,
and shall cause their Affiliates not to treat, the "next day" rule of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any similar provision
of state or local Tax Law as applying to the deductions described in
the previous sentence, and no elections that would result in the ratable
allocation of such deductions shall be made under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2) or any similar provision of state or local Tax Law. 

   

 (g) _Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Fund shall (a) be used solely for the purposes set forth in _Section 3.6(c)_, _Section 12.2(a)_ and _Section 13.1(a)_; _provided_  that the permitted use under _Section 3.6(c)_ shall terminate five (5) Business Days after the date on which each of the Final Company Net Indebtedness, the Final Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Final Company Expenses are finally agreed or determined, (b) thereafter be used solely to satisfy any claims of the Parent for indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_ and _Section 13.1(a)_ made from and after Closing but on or before the Cut-Off Date applicable to the representation, warranty, covenant or indemnity to which such claim(s) relates and (c) terminate at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (other than with respect to claims in subparagraph (b) above made on or before the applicable Cut-Off Date). Any shares of Parents Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund other than amounts with respect to claims in subparagraph (b) above made on or before the applicable Cut-Off Date shall thereafter be distributed to the Stockholders based on such Stockholders Stockholder Percentage. The Escrow Fund shall be held and disbursed solely for the respective purposes and in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 3.8 _Relationship Among the Stockholders_. 

   

 (a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Stockholders Representative as the sole representative of the Stockholders to act as the agent and on behalf of such Stockholders regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement, including for the purposes of: (i) making decisions with respect to the determination of the Company Net Indebtedness, the Preferred Liquidation Amount and the Company Expenses under _Section 3.6_; (ii) determining whether the conditions to closing in _ARTICLE X_ have been satisfied and supervising the Closing, including waiving any condition, as determined by the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion; (iii) taking any action that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE XI_ ; (iv) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the amendment of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 14.2_; (v) accepting notices on behalf of the Stockholders in accordance with _Section 14.5_; (vi) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Stockholders Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or entering into settlements and compromises of any claim for indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE XII_  hereof, (vii) delivering or causing to be delivered to the Parent at the Closing certificates representing the Shares to be sold by the Stockholders hereunder; (viii) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Stockholders, any and all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the Stockholders, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ix) granting any consent, waiver or approval on behalf of the

Stockholders under this Agreement. As the representative of the Stockholders
under this Agreement, the Stockholders Representative shall act as the agent
for all Stockholders, shall have authority to bind each such Person in
accordance with this Agreement, and the Parent may rely on such appointment
and authority until the receipt of notice of the appointment of a successor
upon two (2) Business Days prior written notice to the Parent. The Parent
may conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or
investigation, all decisions made by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with this Agreement in writing and signed by an officer of
the Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (b) Each Stockholder hereby appoints the Stockholders Representative as such Stockholders true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, in such Stockholders name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with the sale of such Stockholders Shares as fully to all intents and purposes as such Stockholder might or could do in person. In acting as the sole representative of the Stockholders hereunder prior to the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative shall take such actions consistent with and in accordance with the terms of the CHS Stockholders Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Stockholders Representative (in its capacity as Stockholders Representative) shall have no liability to the Parent for any default under this Agreement by any other Stockholder. Except for fraud or willful misconduct on its part, the Stockholders Representative shall have no liability to any other Stockholder under this Agreement for any action or omission by the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the other Stockholders. 

  

 3.9 _Limitation on Cash Consideration Payable to the Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent shall in no event pay the Stockholders any amounts of cash in exchange for Common Stock if the Threshold Percentage would be less than 40.5% after such payment. To the extent that an amount of cash otherwise payable to the Stockholders under this Agreement would cause the Threshold Percentage to be lower than 40.5% at the time of such payment (such excess amount, the " _Excess Cash Amount_ "), such Excess Cash Amount shall be payable in an equivalent amount of Parents Stock (with each share of Parents Stock valued for this purpose using the Applicable Stock Value), provided that any fractional share of Parents Stock shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share. 

   

 (a) The term " _Threshold Percentage_ " shall mean the quotient, expressed as a percentage, obtained by _dividing_ (i) the Non-Escrow Stock Consideration by (ii) the sum of (A) the Non-Escrow Stock Consideration _plus_ (B) the Stockholders Cash Amount _plus_  (C) the Preferred Liquidation Amount _plus_ (D) the Warrant Value. 

  

 (b) The term " _Non-Escrow Stock Consideration_ " shall mean, as of the date of a given payment, the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parents Stock delivered to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, excluding the Escrow Amount (whether or not such shares are distributed to the Stockholders) _multiplied_ by (ii) the Applicable Stock Value. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The term " _Applicable Stock Value_ " shall mean the average of the high and low selling prices of a share of Parents Stock quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System Global Market, as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the last trading day immediately prior to (i) the date hereof if, as of the Closing Date, Temp. Reg. section 1.368-1(e)(2) has not expired or has been replaced by a regulation permitting or requiring Parents Stock to be valued, for purposes of applying the continuity of interest requirement under Section 368 of the Code, on the last trading day immediately prior to the date hereof, or (ii) the Closing Date if the condition described in clause (i) is not satisfied as of the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) The term " _Stockholders  Cash Amount_" shall mean, as of the date of a given payment, the aggregate amount of cash paid to the Stockholders in exchange for Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders Cash Amount shall include all amounts of cash paid to the Stockholders pursuant to the penultimate sentence of _Section 3.6(c)_ and pursuant to  _Section 13.5(a)_.

 8.3 _Filings and Authorizations; Consummation_.

   ##### 

  

 

the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order that has the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but only and
to the extent that any such action does not materially deprive the Parent of

Law, a court enters or the applicable Governmental Authority makes an order
or decree permitting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but
requiring that any of the businesses, product lines or assets of any of the
Parent or its Affiliates or of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective Affiliates be divested or held separate by the Parent, or that
would otherwise limit the Parents freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, the Company and any Company Subsidiary or any portion
thereof or any of the Parents or its Affiliates other assets or businesses,
but only and to the extent that any such action does not materially deprive
the Parent of the benefits of the transactions contemplated herein. 

   

 (e) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. The Parent will advise the Company promptly in respect of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (whether oral or written) which the Parent proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The parties hereto recognize and agree that immediate irreparable damages for which there is not adequate remedy at law would occur in the event that the provisions of this _Section 8.9_ are not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or are otherwise breached.

       ##### 

  

   

 8.11 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Parent shall, and shall cause, service completed with the Company or a Company Subsidiary by the individuals who are employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date (" _Grandfathered Employees_ ") to be taken into account for purposes of participation, coverage, vesting and level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or plan which provides post-retirement medical benefits), as applicable, under all severance payment plans, employee benefit plans, programs and policies of the Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) from and after the Closing Date to the same extent as such service was taken into account under corresponding Company Benefit Plans immediately before the Closing Date for such purposes; provided, however, that no such service credit shall result in the duplication of any benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, Grandfathered Employees will not be subject to any pre-existing condition or limitation under any health or welfare plan of the Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) for any condition for which the Grandfathered Employee had coverage immediately before the Closing Date under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan. The Parent shall, and shall cause, the Grandfathered Employees to be given credit under any plan of the Parent and its subsidiaries for co-payments made, and deductibles satisfied, under any corresponding Company Benefit Plan for the plan year which includes the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) No provision of this _Section 8.11(b)_ shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any Grandfathered Employee or any other Person other than the Company or the Parent. 

  

 8.12 _Restrictive Covenants_. In order to adequately protect the interests of the Parent and Surviving Corporation, the Kohlberg Entities and Cucuel agree to be bound as follows: 

   

 (a) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, the Kohlberg Entities and Cucuel (each on their own behalf) shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any of them or any other Person, recruit or otherwise solicit or induce any member of senior management, key employee or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or hire any such Person who has ceased to be employed or otherwise engaged by the Company or any Company Subsidiary during the preceding six months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prevent the Kohlberg Entities or Cucuel, as the case may be, from soliciting or hiring any person (i) who is terminated by the Company, the Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing or (ii) as result of a general solicitation of employment not specifically directed toward employees of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 (b) The Kohlberg Entities and Cucuel (each on their own behalf) agree that, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, each of them shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, hold in strict confidence all Confidential Information they possess. In the event that the Kohlberg Entities, Cucuel or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be, are required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Kohlberg Entities and/or Cucuel, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Parent in writing so that the Parent may, at its sole cost and expense, seek a 

   ##### 

  

 

protective order and/or other motion filed to prevent the production or
disclosure of Confidential Information. If such motion has been denied, then
the Kohlberg Entities and/or Cucuel, as the case may be, may disclose only
such portion of the Confidential Information which is required by Law to be
disclosed; _provided_ , _that_ , (A) the Kohlberg Entities and/or Cucuel, as
the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the remainder of the Confidential Information and (B) the
Kohlberg Entities and/or Cucuel, as the case may be, shall not, and shall not
permit any of their respective Representatives to, oppose any motion
for confidentiality brought by the Parent in any such instance. The Kohlberg
Entities and/or Cucuel will continue to be bound by their respective
obligations pursuant to this _Section 8.12(b)_ for any Confidential
Information that is not required to be disclosed pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence above, or that has been afforded protective
treatment pursuant to such motion. 

   

 (c) Cucuel agrees that, for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date he shall not, directly or indirectly, on Cucuels own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others (except for the Surviving Corporation) provide services substantially similar to those Cucuel performed for the Company or any Company Subsidiary or on behalf of the Kohlberg Entities at any time within the last twelve (12) months of his employment with the Company, to or for the benefit of any Person which provides or offers to provide home infusion therapy services or home nursing services, which Cucuel acknowledges is part of the Companys business, within the Territory. For purposes of this  _Section 8.12_, " _Territory_ " shall mean the fifty states comprising the United States. Cucuel acknowledges that the Company provides services on a national basis and agrees that, given his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and President and Secretary of the Company Subsidiaries, this provision is reasonable and necessary to adequately protect the interests of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) Cucuel agrees that for a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, he shall not, on his own behalf or on behalf of any Person (except for the Surviving Corporation during such time as Cucuel is engaged as a consultant thereto), solicit, contact or call upon for the purpose of selling any service that is competitive with home infusion therapy services, home nursing services, medical equipment or respiratory therapy, any customer or potential customer, or any physician or Hospital that competes with the Company or any Company Subsidiary at the time of Closing, within the Territory. Cucuel agrees that, given his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and President and Secretary of the Company Subsidiaries, this provision is reasonable and necessary to adequately protect the interests of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) Cucuel and the Company have agreed to enter into a Separation and Transition Services Agreement prior to Closing that: (i) terminates Cucuels employment with the Company without Cause effective on the Closing Date, (ii) provides for the payment twelve (12) months of severance pursuant to his existing employment agreement with the Company, (iii) provides for Cucuel to provide certain consulting services on a limited time, non-exclusive basis to the Company for the one year period immediately following the Closing, (iv) grants to the Company a one-time election to extend Cucuels one year consulting period for an additional one year period at its election, (v) extends the one year time restrictions in _Sections_ _8.12(c)_ and _8.12(d)_ of this Agreement by an additional one year in the event that the Company elects to extend Cucuels consulting period; _provided_ , that the Company agrees to pay or has 

   ##### 

  

 

paid Cucuel three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in consulting
fees pursuant to such Separation and Transition Services Agreement during
such two year consulting period. The terms of such agreement, when taking
into account the payments under the existing employment agreement, shall be
consistent with the regulations under Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 8.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) The Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary to contain provisions concerning indemnification of directors and officers no less favorable to the beneficiaries thereof than those set forth in such organizational documents as of the date hereof. From and after the Closing, the Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary, (i) to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and each present and former director and officer, as applicable, of each Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case, when acting in such capacity, against any Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in connection with any action arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in connection with any matters for which such Company Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 8.13_, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; provided that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnification; and provided, further, that any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable law or the organizational documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Company. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation for itself and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain, in effect a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (true and complete copies of which have been heretofore made available by the Company to the Parent and its agents and representatives) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Parent or the Company be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, and if such premium would at any time exceed 200% of such amount, then the Parent or the Company shall maintain insurance policies which provide the maximum and best coverage available at an annual premium equal to 200% of such amount; and _provided_ , further, that this _Section 8.13(b)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been obtained by the Company, at the expense of Parent, which policy or policies provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in this _Section 8.13(b)_ for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date, including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   #####

accuracy or completeness of any information relating to the Company or
any other information furnished by the Company for inclusion in the

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall (i) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under  _Section 12.2(a)_, on the one hand, or of the Parent under _Section 12.2(b)_, on the other hand, in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the then available Escrow Fund (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all breaches constituting Unrestricted Claims shall not be subject to the Cap and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Stockholder under _Section 12.2(a)_ and _Section 13.1(a)_ shall not exceed the amount of cash proceeds and the value of Parents Stock (valued at the Parent Stock Value) actually received by such Stockholder under this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

for the cancellation and exchange of such Stockholders Shares on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to each Kohlberg Entity in
no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Kohlberg Entity or
all of the Kohlberg Entities under _Section 12.2(a)_ and _Section 13.1(a)_
exceed the amount of cash proceeds and the value of Parents Stock (valued at
the Parent Stock Value) actually received by all of the Kohlberg Entities
under this Agreement for the cancellation and exchange of Shares of the
Kohlberg Entities on the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Stockholder Indemnitees or the Parent Indemnitees, respectively, under _ARTICLE XII_ unless (i) any individual Loss or group or series of related Losses exceed $50,000 (such Loss or group or series of related Losses that does not exceed $50,000, the " _DeMinimis Losses_ "), and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under _Section 12.2(a)_, on the one hand, and _Section 12.2(b)_, on the other hand (which shall not include for such purposes DeMinimis Losses), exceed an amount equal to $1,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Stockholder Indemnitee or the Parent Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses (which shall include for such purposes DeMinimis Losses) in excess of the Basket Amount up to the Cap;  _provided_ , _however_ , that claims under _Section 12.2(a)(v)_, claims under  _Section 13.1_ and claims for any and all breaches of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement (other than under _Section 12.2(a)(vi)_) and the Specified Representations shall not be subject to the Basket Amount, but instead shall be recoverable from "dollar one." 

  

 (c) The cumulative indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under  _Section 12.2(a)_ (other than for Unrestricted Claims) and _Section 13.1(a)_ (other than for Unrestricted Claims) shall be recoverable solely from the Escrow Fund (as shall be reduced from time to time to reflect payments, if any, made from time to time from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement). In the event (i) the Parent recovers a payment from the Escrow Fund and (ii) such indemnification obligations arose directly from the breach of a Stockholder Representation or Stockholder Covenant by a Stockholder, such Stockholder shall promptly make a cash payment to each other Stockholder in amount equal to such other Stockholders pro rata portion of the amount recovered from the Escrow Fund. Subject to the penultimate sentence hereof, the Parent agrees and acknowledges on behalf of itself and the Parent Indemnitees, that: (1) a Parent Indemnitee must first assert any claim for indemnification under  _ARTICLE XII_ and _ARTICLE XIII_ against the then available Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (2) if the amount recoverable by a Parent Indemnitee in respect of a breach of a Stockholder Covenant or Stockholder Representation pertaining to any Unrestricted Claim of a Stockholder exceeds the amount of the then available Escrow Fund or if the Escrow Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms, then (x) a Parent Indemnitee shall assert such claim solely against that Stockholder who is in breach of the Unrestricted Claim, and no other Stockholder shall have any liability with respect to such Unrestricted Claim, and (y) in the case of an Unrestricted Claim that is a Company Representation or a Company Covenant, against the Stockholders on a several basis based on their respective Stockholder Percentage (and not on a joint or joint and several basis), for the amount of Losses not recovered by such Parent Indemnitee from the then available Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any such claim against a Kohlberg Entity, (i) the Parent Indemnitees may assert a claim against any Kohlberg Entity for any breach by any other Kohlberg Entity of any Unrestricted Claim that is a breach of a Stockholder 

   ##### 

  

 

Covenant and (ii) each Kohlberg Entity shall be liable based upon the
aggregate Stockholder Percentage of all Kohlberg Entities for the amount of
Losses not recovered by such Parent Indemnitee for such
Unrestricted Claims. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any thing to the contrary herein, in connection with any release (or holdback by the Escrow Agent) of shares of Parents Stock held in the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall release to the applicable party on such release date (or holdback in the Escrow Account on such date) such number of shares of Parents Stock having an aggregate value (with each share of Parents Stock valued at the Parent Stock Value) equal to the aggregate amount to be released (or held back) on such applicable date. 

  

 (e) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified for special, consequential or punitive damages, including diminution in value, multiple of earnings or profits theory, business interruptions, or loss of business opportunity or reputation damages (except to the extent included in a Third Party Claim). 

  

 (f) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing, (ii) any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was included in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price (to the extent so included), including in the calculation of Final Company Net Indebtedness, (iii) any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly delivered prior to the applicable Cut-Off Date, and (iv) any Losses to the extent which there is a related amount expressly reserved against in the Company Financial Statements. 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) none of the limitations on the indemnification obligations of the parties hereto shall apply to claims based on fraud or intentional breaches and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Stockholders and the Company contained herein and any right of indemnification with respect thereto shall not be affected by any investigation conducted for or on behalf of, or any knowledge possessed or acquired at any time by, the Parent or its Affiliates, employees, or representatives concerning any circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation with respect thereto. 

  

 12.4 _Indemnification Claim Process_. 

   

 (a) All claims for indemnification by either a Stockholder Indemnitee or a Parent Indemnitee under this _ARTICLE XII_ shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with  _Sections 12.4_ and _12.5_. 

  

 (b) If a Parent Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XII_ , the Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Stockholders Representative in writing of such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (the " _Claims Notice_ "); _provided_ that, subject to _Section 12.3(f)_ , the failure of the Parent Indemnitee to promptly notify Stockholders Representative shall not relieve the Stockholders from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Stockholders were actually prejudiced by such delay. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If a Stockholder Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XII_ , the Stockholder Indemnitee shall promptly deliver a Claims Notice to the Parent; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 12.3(f)_, the failure of a Stockholder Indemnitee to promptly notify the Parent shall not relieve the Parent from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Stockholders were actually materially prejudiced by such delay. 

  

 (d) The Indemnitor shall have twenty-five (25) calendar days from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice. 

   

 (i) In the event that the Indemnitor (a) notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (b) provides the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, (i) the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully liable, the Indemnitor makes such payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release; _provided_ , _that_ , the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in (but not control), the defense of such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (ii) In the event that (a) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (b) the Indemnitor does not provide the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, (i) then the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully liable, the Indemnitor makes such payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and shall have joint control over the investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor is determined to be liable pursuant to the terms hereof for such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for reasonable costs and expenses of such separate co-counsel. 

   

 (iii) In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense, Indemnitee 

   ##### 

  

    

shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, and the
Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with
respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without
the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) with respect to any such Third Party Claim
for which the Indemnitor has provided to the Indemnitee an Acknowledgement of
Liability Certificate; _provided_ ,  _that_ , if the Indemnitor does not
provide the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, the
Indemnitee may enter into any settlement of, or consent to judgment with
respect to any such Third Party Claim without waiving or otherwise
adversely affecting any rights hereunder. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties shall
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. 

   

 (e) Subject to the provisions of _Section 12.4(d)(i)_ and _12.4(d)(ii)_ , if the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty-five (25) calendar days of receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnitor at any time after such 25 calendar day period. 

  

 (f) The Parent Indemnitee shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to, provide reasonable cooperation with the Stockholders Representative in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which a Parent Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XII_ that the Stockholders Representative has elected to control, including, but not limited to, by providing the Stockholders Representative with reasonable access to books, records, employees and officers (including as witnesses) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. 

  

 12.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall also (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the date such item was paid or accrued; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 12.3(f)_, the failure of the Parent Indemnitee to promptly notify Stockholders Representative shall not relieve the Stockholders from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Stockholders were actually materially prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. 

    ##### 

  

     

 12.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in the case of fraud or intentional breaches, the indemnification provisions of _ARTICLE XII_ and _ARTICLE XIII_ with respect to Taxes shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of parties following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or any other provision of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 12.7 _Tax; Insurance; Other Indemnification_. The amount of any Losses suffered by an Indemnitee shall be reduced by any tax benefit to the extent utilized, any insurance or any other payments actually received pursuant to an indemnification under any Prior Purchase Agreement (net of the direct costs incurred in procuring such payments). The Parent shall, or shall cause the Company, to pursue any and all other commercially reasonable remedies to collect any indemnification or other amounts pursuant to the Prior Purchase Agreements covering the Loss that is the subject to the claim for indemnification to the extent that the Parent determines in good faith that indemnification is available under a Prior Purchase Agreement. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are actually received by the Parent with respect to any Losses after the Parent has received indemnification proceeds hereunder, the Parent shall promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the receipt or recovery of such proceeds or recoveries, pay to the applicable Stockholders in accordance with the Stockholder Percentage or such other percentage as the Stockholders Representative shall direct an amount equal to the lesser of the (x) amount of such recovery proceeds or benefits actually received in respect of such claim and (y) the amount of indemnification Losses the Parent received from the Stockholders in respect of such claim; _provided_ , that, for purposes of valuing any Parents Stock in satisfaction of indemnification Losses that the Parent received from the Stockholders in respect of such claims, the Parents Stock shall be valued at the Parent Stock Value. 

   

 12.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. It is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly. 

   

ARTICLE XIII 

   

 _TAX INDEMNITY AND PROCEDURES_  

  

 13.1 _Indemnification_  

   

 (a) The Stockholders on a several basis (and not a joint or joint and several basis) shall be responsible for and shall pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnitees from and against any Losses as a result of: 

  

 (i) Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary imposed or sought to be imposed on the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the foregoing for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) Without duplication, Taxes imposed or sought to be imposed on the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the foregoing as a result of any breach of any of the representations contained in _Section 6.12_, or any of the covenants or agreements set forth in _Section 8.21_ of this Agreement, and any Losses arising from Taxes imposed on the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the foregoing as a result of a breach of any of the Company Covenants; 

  

 (iii) Taxes imposed or sought to be imposed on the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the foregoing with respect to any taxable period pursuant to any obligation (other than an obligation solely between or among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are Subsidiaries on the Closing Date) to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary or other group basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or included the Company or any Subsidiary at any time on or before the Closing Date, including any such obligation arising under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or similar provision of state, local or foreign law; and 

  

 (iv) Taxes incurred by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the foregoing after the Closing Date related to the items disclosed on _Schedule 6.12_. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Parent Indemnitees only for Taxes that are actually payable, and not for
the inability to utilize Tax attributes in any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each Kohlberg Entity shall jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnitees for any indemnification
obligation of any Kohlberg Entity pursuant to this _ARTICLE XIII_. 

   

 (b) The indemnification obligations contained in _Section 13.1(a)_ shall be the sole remedy available to the Parent in connection with Taxes, and such indemnification obligations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations contained in this _Section 13.1_ shall be subject to _Section 12.3_, and claims for indemnification under this _Section 13.1_ shall not be considered to be claims arising under  _ARTICLE XII_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the indemnity obligations contained in this _Section 13.1_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 12.7_. 

  

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, the Parent shall indemnify the Stockholders and their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Tax Indemnified Stockholder Parties_ ") against and hold harmless from any and all Taxes of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof for periods beginning on the Closing Date other than amounts for which the Parent is entitled to be indemnified by the Stockholders under _Section 13.1(a),_ and such indemnification obligations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. 

  

 (d) All amounts required to be paid by the Stockholders pursuant to this _ARTICLE XIII_  shall be paid in accordance with the relevant provisions of _Section 12.3_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.2 _Tax Returns_. (a) The Stockholders shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Stockholders expense, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (as successor to the Company) to timely file, all Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed with any Tax authority after the Closing Date. The Stockholders shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with applicable law and consistently with  _Section 3.7(f)_ and with past practice to the extent permitted by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the income Tax Returns for the period ending on the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative shall have the sole discretion regarding whether the net operating loss generated in such period (if any) will be carried back or carried forward. The Stockholders Representative shall provide, or cause to be provided, a draft of any such Tax Returns to the Parent for its review at least 30 days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for filing such Tax Return. The Parent shall notify the Stockholders Representative of any reasonable objections the Parent may have to any items set forth in such draft Tax Return and the Parent and Stockholders Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any such objections, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Stockholders and the Parent. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Stockholders and the Parent. 

   

 (b) The Parent shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date. Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Returns_ ") shall be prepared consistently with past practice to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Stockholder Representative a draft of any Straddle Return at least 30 days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for filing such Tax Return, for review by the Stockholders Representative. Stockholders Representative shall notify the Parent of any reasonable objections Stockholders Representative may have to any items set forth in such draft Straddle Return and the Parent and Stockholders Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any such objections, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Stockholders and the Parent. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Stockholders and the Parent. The Parent shall notify the Stockholders Representative of any amounts due from the Stockholders in respect of any Tax Return in respect of a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, the Stockholders shall pay to the Parent the amount of Taxes for which Stockholders are responsible. 

  

 (c) Except to the extent required by law, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the written consent of the Stockholders which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.3 _Cooperation_. After the Closing, the Parent and Stockholders shall promptly make available or cause to be made available to the other, as reasonably requested (at the expense of the requesting party), and to any taxing authority, all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities and potential Tax liabilities relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods prior to or including the Closing Effective Date and shall preserve all such information, records and documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof. 

   

 13.4 _Contests_. 

   

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 13.4(b)_ below, whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Stockholders are or may be liable under this Agreement, the Parent shall, if informed of such an assertion, promptly inform the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Stockholders may be liable under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that if such settlement may affect the liability for Taxes (or right to a tax benefit) for which the Parent is liable (or to which the Parent is entitled), such settlement shall not be agreed to without the consent of the Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 13.4(a)_, whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, Parent shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute, except to the extent such proceedings affect the amount of Taxes for which Stockholders are liable under this Agreement, in which case such settlement shall not be agreed to by the Parent without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the procedures described in this _Section 13.4_ shall govern all claims for Taxes, and such claims shall not be governed by _Sections 12.4_ or  _12.5_ of this Agreement. 

  

 13.5 _Refunds_. __ 

   

 (a) The Stockholders will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent such credits or refunds do not arise from or relate to the "carryback" of a Tax item from a period beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period. Subject to _Section 3.9_, the Parent shall cause such refund to be paid to the Stockholders promptly following receipt. 

  

 (b) If the Stockholders Representative determines that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will carry back the net operating losses (if any) described in _Section 13.2(a)_ , Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (as successor to the Company) to 

   ##### 

  

    

file appropriate refund claims within a reasonable period after the Surviving
Corporation files such Tax Returns. 

  

 (c) Except as provided in _Section 13.5(a)_, the Surviving Corporation (as successor to the Company) will be entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 13.6 _Tax Elections_. The Parent shall not, without the prior consent of the Stockholder (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make, or cause to permit to be made, any Tax election, or adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, or undertake any other extraordinary action on the Closing Date, that would materially affect the Taxes of the Stockholders or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent not paid prior to Closing, all amounts set forth on _Schedule 6.17(f)(2)_ shall be treated as Company Expenses.

 _Exhibit A_ 

   

Form of Escrow Agreement 

   ##### 

  

  

FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT 

   

 ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of _ _ ___, 2010 by and among U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), Kohlberg Investors V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the Stockholders Representative (the " _Stockholders  Representative_"), and BioScrip, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent_ ").

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 4.2(k) of the Merger Agreement, the Parent has delivered to the Escrow Agent certificates representing [ _ _] shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Parent (the " _Parent Shares_ "), having an aggregate value (with each Parent Share valued at the Agreed Upon Share Value as defined 

   ##### 

  

    

herein) equal to Twenty-two Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars ($22,500,000), registered in the name of the Escrow Agent along with
stock powers executed in blank (the " _Escrow Property_ "), for the sole
purposes of satisfying (x) the Stockholders obligations, if any, to pay to
the Parent a post-closing purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 3.6 of
the Merger Agreement and (y) certain indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders pursuant to Articles XII and XIII of the Merger Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, all dividends and other distributions declared and paid on the Escrow Property is referred to as the " _Escrow Property Interest_ "; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, and the Parent desire to create an escrow account for the Escrow Property, and to appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent for such account upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties have agreed that for purposes of making purchase price adjustment and indemnification payments under the Escrow Property and the disbursement of the same, each Parent Share shall be valued at $8.3441 (the " _Agreed Upon Per Share Value_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties wish to specify their respective rights and obligations with respect to the Escrow Property and the Escrow Property Interest. 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 1\. (a) The Stockholders Representative and the Parent hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent to hold, in a separate account, the Escrow Property Interest in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to establish and maintain the Escrow Property in a separate account and shall invest any cash Escrow Property Interest, as directed by the Stockholders Representative, from time to time, in writing, in (i) designated readily marketable direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America (" _U.S. Securities_ "), (ii) bank time deposits evidenced by certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks in the United States having capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000, (iii) commercial paper rated at least A-1 or the equivalent thereof by Standard and Poors Corporation or at least P-1 or the equivalent thereof by Moodys Investors Service Inc., (iv) repurchase agreements with the Escrow Agent or one of the Escrow Agents affiliates using U.S. Securities as collateral, in each case with a maturity of not more than sixty (60) days, or (v) a money market fund that invests only in U.S. Securities (collectively, all investments referred to in clauses (i)-(v) are referred to herein as " _Permitted Investments_ "). All Escrow Property Interest shall accrue for the benefit of the Stockholders and shall be paid in accordance with Section 2(b)(vii), and the Parent shall not be entitled to receive any such Escrow Property Interest. 

  

 (c) The Parent shall have deposited with the Escrow Agent, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Escrow Agreement, stock 

   ##### 

  

    

certificates registered in the name of the Escrow Agent evidencing the Escrow
Property. The Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent undated stock powers
separate from the stock certificates representing the Parent Shares, endorsed
in blank. Without limiting the foregoing, any and all other rights with
respect to the Parent Shares, including, without limitation, voting rights,
shall be exercised by the Escrow Agent as directed by the Stockholders
Representative but in no event shall any of such rights be exercised in a
manner inconsistent with or in violation of any of the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement or the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (d) The Escrow Property will be held for the benefit of the parties hereto and will not be subject to any lien or attachment of any creditor of any party hereto and will be used solely for the purposes and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Until such time as the Parent Shares are released from the Escrow Property in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Stockholders will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers all or a portion of the economic consequences associated with, or pledge or grant any security interest in, or otherwise encumber any of the Parent Shares. 

  

 (e) Neither the Escrow Agent nor any nominee shall be under any duty to take any action to preserve, protect, exercise or enforce any rights or remedies under or with respect to the Escrow Property (including without limitation with respect to the exercise of any voting or consent rights, conversion or exchange rights, defense of title, preservation of rights against prior matters or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Escrow Agent is so requested in a written request of the Stockholders Representative received by the Escrow Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

date on which the Escrow Agent is requested therein to take such action (or
such later date as may be acceptable to the Escrow Agent), the Escrow Agent
shall execute or cause its nominee to execute and deliver to
the Stockholders Representative a proxy or other instrument in the form
supplied to it by the Stockholders Representative for voting or otherwise
exercising any right of consent with respect to any of the Escrow Property
held by it hereunder, to authorize therein the Stockholders Representative
to exercise such voting or consent authority in respect of the Parent Shares
held in the Escrow Property (provided that the Escrow Agent shall not be
obliged to execute any such proxy or other instrument if, in its reasonable
judgment, the terms thereof may subject the Escrow Agent to any liabilities
or obligations in its individual capacity). The Escrow Agent shall not be
under any duty or responsibility to forward to any party, or to notify any
party with respect to, or to take any action with respect to, any notice,
solicitation or other document or information, written or otherwise, received
from an issuer or other person with respect to the Escrow Property, including
but not limited to, proxy material, tenders, options, the pendency of calls
and maturities and expiration of rights. 

  

 (f) The Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or investigation, all decisions made by the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Stockholders in connection with this Agreement in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders Representative agrees that it shall send a copy of all notices or statements received or sent hereunder to each Stockholder, within a reasonable period of time after receipt or delivery (as applicable) thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2\. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, the Escrow Property shall be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent as follows: 

   

 (a) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days after the date that the Statement becomes final and binding upon the Stockholders and the Parent as provided in Section 3.6(b) of the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders Representative and the Parent shall, if any payment is due to the Parent, give a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of a portion of the Escrow Property (the " _Purchase Price Disposition Notice_ "). Within three (3) Business Days of the receipt of the Purchase Price Disposition Notice, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Parent such number of Parent Shares from the Escrow Property having an aggregate value (based upon the Agreed Upon Per Share Value) as set forth in the Purchase Price Disposition Notice. 

  

 (b) _Indemnification Payments_. 

  

 (i) If the Parent intends to assert a claim against the Escrow Property for Losses pursuant to Articles XII or XIII of the Merger Agreement, the Parent shall deliver a Claims Notice in accordance with Section 12.4 of the Merger Agreement or notice in accordance with Section 13.4 of the Merger Agreement to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders Representative prior to the termination of the applicable survival period for such claim. 

  

 (ii) If, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders Representative of a Claims Notice or other notice pursuant to Article XIII of the Merger Agreement (the " _Objection Period_ "), the Escrow Agent has not received a written statement from the Stockholders Representative (the 

   ##### 

  

    

" _Objection Notice_ ") disputing the Parents right to indemnification
and/or the amount of indemnification sought in such notice, the Escrow Agent
shall, within five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the Objection
Period, deliver to the Parent out of the Escrow Property such number of
Parent Shares having an aggregate value (based upon the Agreed Upon Per Share
Value) equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of the available remaining
Escrow Property (based upon the Agreed Upon Per Share Value) and (y) the
amount specified in the Claims Notice or other notice pursuant to Article
XIII of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (iii) If, during the Objection Period, the Escrow Agent receives an Objection Notice, the Escrow Agent shall (i) promptly forward a copy of that statement to the Parent, (ii) if applicable, deliver to the Parent out of the remaining Escrow Property such number of Parent Shares having an aggregate value (based upon the Agreed Upon Per Share Value) equal to the amount that is specifically set forth in the Objection Notice not to be in dispute and (iii) continue to hold, to the extent available, in escrow such number of Parent Shares having an aggregate value (based upon the Agreed Upon Per Share Value) equal to the amount in dispute, until receipt of (A) a joint statement signed by the Stockholders Representative and the Parent directing the disposition of all or part of the remaining Escrow Property or (B) a certified copy of a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction of the disputed matters set forth in the Objection Notice ordering the Escrow Agent to dispose of the amount in dispute (but in no event to exceed the number of Parent Shares remaining in the Escrow Property). Upon receipt of any such statement or court determination, the Escrow Agent shall promptly comply with its terms. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) The Escrow Property shall only be available to pay for (x) any purchase price adjustment in favor of the Parent, (y) Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee for Taxes under Article XIII of the Merger Agreement and (z) Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee under Article XII of the Merger Agreement (such Losses referred to in clauses (y) and (z) above, " _Indemnification Losses_ ". 

  

 (v) The Parent and the Stockholders Representative acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Property shall be the Parents sole and exclusive remedy for any claims under Sections 12.2(a) and 13.1(a) of the Merger Agreement (other than Unrestricted Claims). In the event the number of Parent Shares in the Escrow Property is insufficient to pay the amount of the purchase price adjustment in favor of the Parent under the Merger Agreement or any claim for which the Escrow Property is the sole and exclusive remedy in full (other than Unrestricted Claims), the Parent shall not be entitled to collect any amounts in excess of the then available Escrow Property and no Stockholder or other Person shall have any liability for any shortfall. 

  

 (vi) Except as otherwise directed by the Stockholders Representative, not later than ten (10) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement until such time as the Escrow Property is fully depleted, all accrued and unpaid Escrow Property Interest shall be released by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders based on each Stockholders Escrow Allocation Percentage as set forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto. 

  

 (vii) Except as otherwise directed by the Stockholders Representative, on [insert date of the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date], (x) the Escrow Agent shall release all Parent Shares remaining in the Escrow Property (including any remaining accrued and unpaid Escrow Property 

   ##### 

  

    

Interest thereon) along with stock powers executed in blank to the
Stockholders based on each Stockholders Escrow Allocation Percentage and (y)
the Company shall promptly, but in no event more than two Business Days
thereafter, issue new share certificates with respect to such Parent
Shares reflecting the name of each Stockholder and the number of Parent
Shares held by such Stockholder, based on such Stockholders Escrow
Allocation Percentage, and register such Parent Shares on the books of the
Parent in the name of such Stockholder; _provided_ , that the Escrow Agent
shall retain in the remaining Escrow Property a number of Parent Shares
having an aggregate value (based upon the Agreed Upon Share Value), to the
extent available, equal to the sum of (A) any amount then payable to the
Parent under Section 2(b)(ii) and (B) any additional amount of
Indemnification Losses claimed in good faith by the Parent and disputed in
good faith by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with Section
2(b)(iii). 

  

 (c) This Agreement and the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall terminate when all amounts of the Escrow Property have been paid to the Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, or the Parent, on the other hand, in accordance with Section 2(a), Section 2(b) or Section 3 of this Agreement. 

  

 3\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Escrow Agent shall dispose of the Escrow Property in accordance with the joint written instructions of the Parent and the Stockholders Representative given at any time. Whenever this Agreement provides for a writing to be delivered by the Parent or the Stockholders Representative to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall only rely on a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Parent or the Stockholders Representative, respectively, and the 

  ##### 

  

    

 Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on an incumbency certificate from the Secretary of the Parent or the Stockholders Representative, as applicable, as evidence that the officer executing such writing on behalf of such party is an authorized officer of such party. 

   

 4\. Not later than ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month during the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Parent and Stockholders Representative a statement reflecting the investment activity and month-end balance with respect to the Escrow Property Interest, if any, during the prior month. 

   

 5\. In consideration of the services provided by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder, the Parent and the Stockholders agree to promptly reimburse the Escrow Agent for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by it with respect to this Agreement, including reasonable fees of legal counsel, and to further compensate the Escrow Agent in accordance with the fee arrangements described in  _Schedule 2_ attached hereto. All such fees and expenses paid under this Section 5 shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders. 

   

 6\. (a) All parties hereto acknowledge that the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are solely ministerial in nature and have been requested for their convenience. The Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be the agent of either/any party hereto, or to have any legal or beneficial interest in the Escrow Property, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 7 of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agent (i) is a party to this Agreement only and has no duties or responsibilities in connection with, and shall not be charged with knowledge of, any agreements related hereto and (ii) shall not be liable for any act or omission taken or suffered in good faith 

   ##### 

  

   

with respect to this Agreement unless such act or omission is the result of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. In no event
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for punitive, consequential or incidental
damages. 

   

 (b) The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with its duties hereunder and shall be fully protected and incur no liability relative to any action or inaction taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of such legal counsel. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for determining the genuineness or validity of any certificate, document, notice or other instrument or item presented to or deposited with it and shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written instruction given to it by any of the parties hereto and reasonably believed by the Escrow Agent to have been signed by the proper representatives of such parties. 

  

 (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any losses relative to the investment or liquidation of the Escrow Property, provided the Escrow Property Interest is invested and held in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement. In addition, the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for assuring that the Escrow Property is sufficient for the disbursements contemplated under Section 2 of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to break or cancel any investment to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate to make any payment required hereby, and shall not be responsible for any costs or penalties associated therewith. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include, but not be limited to, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations imposed after the fact, fire, communications line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be required to institute legal proceedings of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to defend any legal proceedings which may be instituted against it with respect to this Agreement unless requested to do so in writing by any of the parties hereto, and unless and until it is indemnified by the requesting party to the satisfaction of the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, against the cost and expense of such defense, including without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel. If any conflicting demand shall be made upon the Escrow Agent, it shall not be required to determine the same or take any action thereon and may await settlement of the controversy by appropriate and non-appealable legal proceedings. Upon the commencement of any action against or otherwise involving the Escrow Agent with respect to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to interplead the matter of this escrow in the Chosen Court (as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement) and, in such event, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of and discharged from any and all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement. In any such action, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to the indemnities provided in Section 7 below. 

  

 (e) To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7\. The Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative (acting on behalf of the Stockholders), on the other hand, shall, on an equal basis, hold harmless and indemnify the Escrow Agent, its directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against all obligations, liabilities, claims, suits, judgments, losses, damages, costs or expenses of any kind or nature, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any of them in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agents duties hereunder, except to the extent arising from the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. To the extent the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification, fees or expenses hereunder and such indemnification, fees or expenses are not timely paid, the parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall have, and hereby grant the Escrow Agent, a lien for the payment of such indemnification, expenses, or fees upon the Escrow Property. 

   

 8\. The Escrow Agent may resign as escrow agent at any time and be discharged of its duties hereunder after thirty (30) days notice to the Parent and the Stockholders Representative, but only if a successor escrow agent has been appointed by the Parent and the Stockholders Representative prior to the effective date of the Escrow Agents resignation. Upon receipt of notice of resignation, the Parent and the Stockholders Representative promptly shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to designate a successor escrow agent to serve in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Parent and the Stockholders Representative cannot agree on a successor escrow agent during such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall be 

   ##### 

  

   

deemed to be solely a custodian to the Escrow Property, without further
duties and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint (or to petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint) a successor escrow agent to serve
in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Upon receipt of a
statement signed by the Stockholders Representative and the Parent directing
the disposition of the Escrow Property and/or the Escrow Property Interest to
a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall comply promptly with that
statement. Any successor escrow agent appointed by the Escrow Agent shall be
a banking corporation or trust company having total assets in excess of
$500,000,000, which shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions
hereof. Upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent by the Parent and
the Stockholders Representative or by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow
Agents duties and responsibilities under this Agreement shall terminate. If
the Escrow Agent merges or consolidates with another entity, or transfers all
or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another entity, the
surviving entity or transferee, as applicable, shall be the successor Escrow
Agent hereunder without any further action by the parties hereto. 

   

 9\. This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally and may be changed only with the written consent of the Parent, the Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent, which in the case of the Escrow Agent, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 10\. Any notice or other communication required or which may be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, telecopied or sent by certified, registered or express mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed given when so

Any such termination shall be without prejudice to liabilities arising hereunder before such termination. 

   

 Section 6.2 _Non-Survival_. The representations and warranties made herein shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, that money damages would not be sufficient for any breach of this Agreement and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof (without any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security), in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. 

   

 Section 6.4 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 Section 6.7 _Waiver_. Any waiver shall be valid only if set forth in writing signed by the parties hereto. Mere inaction or failure to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Agreement, or delay in exercising the same, will not operate as, nor shall be construed as, a waiver, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right and may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

   

 Section 6.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 6.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as originally contemplated.

 Section 6.11 _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be instituted in any state or federal court in the State of Delaware, and each party waives any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 6.16. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

   

 Section 6.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  #####

AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR

The parties to this Agreement agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

   

 Section 6.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

 Section 6.15 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and which transfer shall not relieve such Principal Stockholder of his obligations hereunder in the event of a breach by its transferee).

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of this 24th day of January, 2010, by and among BioScrip, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Kohlberg Investors V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Kohlberg_ "), Kohlberg Partners V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Kohlberg Offshore Investors V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Kohlberg TE Investors V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, KOCO Investors V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Robert Cucuel, Mary Jane Graves, Nitin Patel, Joey Ryan, Colleen Lederer, Blackstone Mezzanine Partners II L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Blackstone Mezzanine Holdings II L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and S.A.C. Domestic Capital Funding, Ltd., a Cayman Islands limited company (collectively, the " _Stockholders_ "). 

  

 _W I T N E S S E T H_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company entered into that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), with Camelot Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, Critical Homecare Solutions Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and the Stockholders, pursuant to which the Stockholders shall, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, receive shares of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase Common Stock; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties believe it to be in the best interests of the Company, the Stockholders and the other stockholders of the Company to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, to induce the Company and each Stockholder to enter into the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Stockholders do hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Governance_. 

  

 1.1 So long as the Kohlberg Stockholders and/or their Affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate: (a) at least 50% of the Initial Kohlberg Shares, Kohlberg shall be entitled to designate two directors for election by the stockholders of the Company to the Board of Directors (each, a " _Stockholder Nominee_ "); and (b) at least 15% (but less than 50%) of the Initial Kohlberg Shares, Kohlberg shall be entitled to designate one Stockholder Nominee. If at any time the Kohlberg Stockholders and/or their Affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate less than 15% of the Initial Kohlberg Shares, then the Stockholders shall not have the right to designate any Stockholders Nominees pursuant to this Agreement. So long as Kohlberg has the right to designate one or more Stockholder Nominees in accordance with this Section 1.1, except as provided in Section 1.4, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall be fixed at ten. 

   

 1.2 The Company agrees to include the Stockholders Nominees in each slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors in connection with any meeting of the stockholders of the Company (or written consent in lieu thereof) called for the purpose of 

      ##### 

  

    

electing directors to the Board of Directors, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such Stockholders Nominee
to the Board of Directors, including nominating such individuals to be
elected as directors as provided herein. 

   

 1.3 Upon the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of any director who is a Stockholders Nominee, Kohlberg shall be entitled to collectively designate the replacement director for such Stockholders Nominee. In the event that a vacancy is created at any time upon the death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of any director who is a Stockholders Nominee, the Company hereby agrees to take, at any time and from time to time, all actions necessary to cause the vacancy created thereby to be filled as soon as practicable by a new Stockholders Nominee who is designated in the manner specified in this Section 1.3. 

   

 1.4 In the event that Kohlberg shall cease to have the right to designate one or more directors in accordance with Section 1.1, Kohlberg shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the removal or the resignation of the applicable director or directors who are Stockholders Nominees, if any, and the directors remaining in office shall decrease the size of the Board of Directors to eliminate such vacancy. 

   

 1.5 The Company shall compensate each director who is a Stockholders Nominee in the same manner and to the same extent as it compensates its other non-employee directors and shall reimburse each director who is a Stockholders Nominee for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them for the purpose of attending meetings of the Board of Directors or committees thereof. 

   

 1.6 Until Kohlberg ceases to have the right to designate one or more directors in accordance with Section 1.1, except as may be prohibited by applicable law, at least one of Stockholders Nominees shall be entitled to representation on each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors. 

   

 1.7 The rights of Kohlberg pursuant to this Section 1 are personal to Kohlberg and shall not be exercised by any transferee (other than the Kohlberg Stockholders and/or their Affiliates). 

   

 2. _Transfer Restrictions_. 

  

 2.1. _General Restriction_. For a period of two years from the Closing Date, except as set forth in Section 2.2, none of the Stockholders shall, directly or indirectly, make or solicit any sale, assignment, transfer, distribution or other disposition of any shares of Common Stock, or create incur, solicit, assume or suffer to exist any security interest, pledge, mortgage, lien, charge, adverse claim of ownership or use or other encumbrance with respect to any shares of Common Stock, except in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable law. 

   

 2.2. _Permitted Transfers_. Each Stockholder shall be entitled to make sales and other transfers of Common Stock (i) pursuant to one or more (x) registered secondary public 

      ##### 

  

    

offerings in connection with the exercise of its rights under Section 4; and
(y) private placements exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
including, without limitation, sales under Rule 144 thereof, in each case in
accordance with applicable securities laws; provided, however, that in the
case of a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, no
Stockholder may sell, transfer or dispose of any Common Stock (other than
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act)

the aggregate, with any Affiliates or members of a "group" (within the

set forth in this Agreement, including this Section 2\. The Company may
require any such Permitted Transferee that beneficially owns more than 5% of

effectiveness of such acquisition, to execute a joinder to this
Agreement, agreeing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 2.3. _Transfer of Registration Rights_. The registration rights set forth in Section 4 may be assigned, in whole or in part, to any Permitted Transferee (who shall be bound by all obligations of this Agreement), but may not be assignable by such Permitted Transferee to any subsequent transferee. 

   

 2.4. _Notice of Proposed Transfer_. Before effecting any proposed transaction permitted by this Section 2, each applicable Stockholder shall provide at least 5 business days written notice to the Company, specifying in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such transaction.

The Company shall not (a) transfer on its books any shares of Common Stock that shall have been disposed of in violation of any of the provisions set forth in 

    #####

    ##### 

  

  

 4. _Registration Rights_. 

  

 4.1 _Demand Registration_. At any time, and from time to time, after the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, holders of then-outstanding Stockholder Shares shall have the right to require the Company to effect unlimited registrations on Form S-3, or any successor form then in effect, under the Securities Act (any such registration, a " _Demand Registration_ "). Upon receipt from a Stockholder or Stockholders (the " _Initiating Stockholders_ ") of any request for a Demand Registration for Common Stock having a market value of not less than $25,000,000, based on the closing price of the Common Stock at 4:00 p.m. on the business day prior to the day of the request, the Company shall give prompt (but in any event not later than two (2) business days after receipt of such request) written notice of such request to each Stockholder, and shall include in such Demand Registration all Stockholder Shares with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 30 days after the delivery of the Companys notice. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the registration statement with regard to such Demand Registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission within sixty (60) days after it receives a request therefor, and to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter. If requested by the Initiating Stockholders, the Company shall take steps as are required to register such Stockholder Shares in such Demand Registration for sale on a continuous basis under Rule 415 under the Securities Act and keep such registration statement (or any replacement registration statement effected upon the expiration of the initial or any subsequent registration statement) effective for such period as is necessary to complete the sale and distribution of all of the Stockholder Shares pursuant thereto, but in any event not longer than one hundred twenty (120) days. No later than the effective date of the Demand Registration, the Company shall furnish (or cause to be furnished) to the Companys transfer agent, from time to time, an opinion of the Companys counsel to facilitate the transfer of the Stockholder Shares in the secondary market, including, but not limited to, the removal of any restrictive legends encumbering such shares. If other securities are included in any Demand Registration that is an underwritten offering, and the managing underwriter for such offering advises the Company that in its opinion the number of securities to be included exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability or price thereof, the Company will include in such registration all Stockholder Shares requested to be included therein prior to the inclusion of any securities that are not Stockholder Shares. If the number of Stockholder Shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number of securities which in the opinion of such underwriter can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering, such Stockholder Shares shall be included pro rata among the holders thereof based on the percentage of the outstanding Stockholder Shares then held by each such Stockholder. If other securities are included in any Demand Registration that is not an underwritten offering, all Stockholder Shares included in such Demand Registration shall be sold prior to the sale of any of such other securities. The Company shall have the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer any Demand Registration that is an underwritten offering, subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the Stockholder Shares to be included in such Demand Registration. 

   

 4.2 _Company Registration_. In the event that the Company proposes to register any shares under the Securities Act in connection with a public offering (other than a Demand 

      ##### 

  

    

Registration) on any form (other than Form S-4 or Form S-8) that would legally
permit the inclusion of Stockholder Shares, the Company shall give each of
the Stockholders written notice thereof as soon as practicable but in no
event less than 30 days prior to such registration, and shall include in such
registration all Stockholder Shares requested in writing to be
included therein, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 4.2.
If in connection with such proposed registration the managing underwriter for
such offering advises the Company that the number of Stockholder Shares
requested to be included therein exceeds the number of shares that can be
sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability thereof,
any shares to be sold by the Company in such offering (" _Company Shares_ ")
shall have priority over any Stockholder Shares, and the number of
Stockholder Shares to be included by a Stockholder in such registration shall
be reduced pro rata on the basis of the number of Stockholder Shares held
by such Stockholder and all other holders (other than the Company) exercising
similar registration rights; provided that no other shares, other than the
Company Shares to be sold in such offering, shall have priority over the
Stockholder Shares. 

   

 4.3 _Costs of Registration_. The Company shall bear the costs of each registration in which Stockholders participate pursuant to this Section 4, including (without limitation) (i) all Securities and Exchange Commission, stock exchange and FINRA registration and filing fees and exchange listing fees, (ii) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses, (iii) all fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of one counsel for the selling Stockholders (to be selected by the holders of a majority of the Stockholder Shares to be included in such registration), (iv) all fees and expenses incurred in complying with state securities or "blue sky" laws (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to any underwriter incurred in connection with "blue sky" qualifications of the registrable shares as may be set forth in any underwriting agreement), (v) any other accounting fees, charges or expenses incurred by the Company incident to or required by any such registration (including any expenses arising from any "cold comfort" letters or any special audits incident to or required by any registration or qualification), and (vi) to the extent the Company determines to obtain such insurance, any liability insurance or other premiums for insurance obtained in connection with any demand registration or piggy-back registration thereon, incidental registration or shelf registration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, regardless of whether such registration statement is declared effective, but excluding any underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of Stockholder Shares or the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by the Stockholders. As a condition to the inclusion of Stockholder Shares in any registration, the participating Stockholders and the Company shall execute a customary underwriting agreement or similar agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and the underwriter(s), if any, for such offering containing customary indemnification and holdback provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Stockholder shall be required to incur indemnification obligations (whether several or joint and several) which are in excess of the net proceeds received by such Stockholder pursuant to such registration or relates to information not supplied by such Stockholder for inclusion in the registration statement. 

   

 4.4 _Procedure_. The Company may require each selling Stockholder to furnish to the Company in writing such information pursuant to Item 507 of Regulation S-K (or any similar disclosure requirement applicable to any registration in which Stockholders participate pursuant 

      ##### 

  

    

to this Section 4) required in connection with such registration regarding
such Stockholder and the distribution of such Stockholder Shares to be
included in such registration as the Company may, from time to time,
reasonably request in writing and the Company may exclude from
such registration the Stockholder Shares of any Stockholder who unreasonably
fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving
such request. 

   

 4.5 _Postponement of Demand Registration_. The Company will be entitled to postpone (but not more than once in any 12-month period), for a reasonable period of time not in excess of 90 days, the filing of a registration statement in accordance with Section 4.1 if the Company notifies the Stockholders requesting the Demand Registration that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (in consultation with outside legal counsel and/or an investment banking firm of recognized national standing), such Demand Registration and offering would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect or materially interfere with any bona fide material financing of the Company or any material transaction under consideration by the Company or would require disclosure of material information that has not been, and is not otherwise required to be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which would materially and adversely affect the Company. Such notice will contain a statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay. 

   

 4.6 _Limitations_. The Company shall not be obligated to effect a Demand Registration for a period of three months following the effective date of a registration statement filed in connection with any registration effected under Section 4.1 or 4.2.

Domestic Capital Funding, Ltd., a Cayman Islands limited company (collectively and together with each of their respective successors and assigns, the " _Purchasers_ "). Capitalized terms shall have the meaning specified in _Section 5.1_ hereof. 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Purchasers have agreed to acquire from the Company, and the Company has agreed to issue to the Purchasers, Warrants to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock set forth opposite such Persons name on _Annex 1_ attached hereto, which Warrants represent the right to purchase, in the aggregate, 3,400,945 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company and the Purchasers wish to enter into this Agreement to govern the terms of the Warrants. 

  

AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as follows: 

  

1\. FORM, EXECUTION AND TRANSFER OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES 

   

 1.1. Form of Warrant Certificates 

    

 The Warrant Certificates shall be in the form set forth in _Attachment A_ hereto. The Warrant Certificates may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation of any governmental authority, stock exchange or self-regulatory organization made pursuant thereto (" _Law_ "). Each Warrant Certificate shall be dated the date of issuance thereof by the Company, either upon initial issuance or upon transfer or exchange. Each Warrant Certificate shall represent the right to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock set forth in such Warrant 

   ##### 

  

 

Certificate at a price per share of Common Stock equal to the Exercise Price;
_provided_ , that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants and the Exercise Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment
as provided herein. 

   

 1.2. Execution of Warrant Certificates; Registration Books 

    

 (a) Execution of Warrant Certificates. The Warrant Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an officer of the Company authorized by the Board of Directors. In case the officer of the Company who shall have signed any Warrant Certificate shall cease to be such an officer of the Company before issuance and delivery by the Company of such Warrant Certificate, such Warrant Certificate nevertheless may be issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though the individual who signed such Warrant Certificate had not ceased to be such an officer of the Company, and any Warrant Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any individual who, at the actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Warrant Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Agreement any such individual was not such an officer. 

   

 (b) Registration Books. The Company will keep or cause to be kept at its office, maintained at the address of the Company referenced in _Section 6.6_, at the Companys transfer agent, or at such other office of the Company of which the Company shall have given notice to each holder of Warrant Certificates, books for registration and transfer of the Warrant Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Warrant Certificates, the registration number and date of each of the Warrant Certificates and the Denomination thereof. 

  

       | 1.3.  |   | Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of
Warrant Certificates; Lost or Stolen Warrant Certificates  
---|---|---|--- 
        

   

 (a) Transfer, Split Up, etc. 

   

 (i) _Transfer_. Subject to compliance with the Securities Act, any applicable state securities laws and the Stockholders Agreement, any Warrant Certificate (or portion thereof), with or without other Warrant Certificates, may be transferred to any Person for a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates in an aggregate like Denomination as the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates (or portions thereof) surrendered then entitled such registered holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer any Warrant Certificate shall make such request in writing delivered to the Company, which request shall include the identity of the Transferee and the aggregate number of Warrants to be transferred, and shall surrender the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates (or portions thereof) to be transferred at the office of the Company referenced in _Section 6.6_ , whereupon the Company shall deliver promptly to such Transferee a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested, which Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates shall evidence, collectively, the same aggregate number of Warrants as the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates 

   ##### 

  

   

(or portions thereof) so surrendered for transfer and shall issue a new
Warrant Certificate to the transferor representing the Warrants retained by
the Transferor if such transfer involved less than the entire number of
Warrants held by such Transferor. 

   

 (ii) _Split Up, Combination, Exchange, etc._ Any Warrant Certificate, with or without other Warrant Certificates, may be split up, combined or exchanged for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates, in an aggregate like Denomination as the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates surrendered then entitle such registered holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to split up, combine or exchange any Warrant Certificate shall make such request in writing delivered to the Company, and shall surrender the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates to be split up, combined or exchanged at the office of the Company referenced in _Section 6.6_, whereupon the Company shall deliver promptly to such registered holder a Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested, which Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates shall evidence, collectively, the same aggregate Denomination as the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates so surrendered for split-up, combination or exchange. 

   

 (b) Loss, Theft, etc. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of, and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of, any Warrant Certificate, and: 

   

 (i) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, an affidavit of loss, together with a customary and reasonable indemnity; or 

   

 (ii) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof; 

   

the Company at its own expense will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a
new Warrant Certificate, dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Warrant Certificate and of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Warrant Certificate and evidencing the same
Denomination as the Warrant Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated. 

  

 1.4. Subsequent Issuance of Warrant Certificates. 

  

 Subsequent to the original issuance, no Warrant Certificates shall be issued except: 

   

 (a) Warrant Certificates issued upon any transfer, combination, split up or exchange of Warrants pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_; 

   

 (b) Warrant Certificates issued in replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificates pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Warrant Certificates issued pursuant to _Section 2.3_ upon the partial exercise of any Warrant Certificate to evidence the unexercised portion of such Warrant Certificate; and 

   

 (d) Warrant Certificates to reflect any adjustments pursuant to _Section 4_. 

  

 1.5. Effect of Issuance in Registered Form 

   

 Every holder of a Warrant Certificate by accepting the same consents and agrees with the Company and with every other holder of a Warrant Certificate that: 

   

 (a) the Warrant Certificates, to the extent then currently transferable, are transferable only on the registry books of the Company if and when surrendered at the office of the Company referenced in _Section 6.6_, duly endorsed or accompanied by an instrument of transfer (in the form attached thereto) and payment of any applicable transfer, stamp or issue tax (a " _Tax_ "); and 

   

 (b) the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name each Warrant Certificate is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Warrants evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Warrant Certificates made by anyone other than the Company) for all purposes whatsoever, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. 

  

2\. EXERCISE OF WARRANTS; PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. 

   

 2.1. Exercise of Warrants. 

   

 (a) Manner of Exercise. At any time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Time, the holder of any Warrant Certificate may exercise the Warrants evidenced thereby, in whole or in any part, by surrender to the Company, at its office referenced in _Section 6.6_ , of such Warrant Certificate, together with a duly executed election to purchase (a form of which is attached to each Warrant Certificate) and payment of the applicable Exercise Price for each share of Common Stock with respect to which the Warrants are then being exercised and an amount equal to any applicable Tax (if not payable by the Company as provided in _Section 3.3_). Such Exercise Price shall be payable either: 

   

 (i) in cash pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_; or 

   

 (ii) by delivery of Warrant Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. 

   

 (b) Payment in Cash. Upon exercise of any Warrants, the holder of a Warrant Certificate may pay the Exercise Price by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Company. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Net Exercise. In the event that any holder of Warrant Certificates delivers such Warrant Certificates to the Company and notifies the Company in writing that such holder intends to exercise all, or any portion of, the Warrants represented by such Warrant Certificates to satisfy its obligation to pay the Exercise Price in respect thereof by virtue of the provisions of this _Section 2.1(c)_, such holder shall become entitled to receive, instead of the number of shares of Common Stock such holder would have received had the Exercise Price been paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_, a number of shares of Common Stock in respect of the exercise of such Warrants equal to the product of: 

   

 (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of such Warrant Certificate (or, if only a portion of such Warrant Certificate is being exercised, issuable upon the exercise of such portion); multiplied by 

   

 (ii) the quotient of: 

   

 (A) the difference of: 

   

 (I) the Market Price per share of Common Stock at the time of such exercise; minus 

   

 (II) the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock at the time of such exercise; 

   

 divided by 

   

 (B) the Market Price per share of Common Stock at the time of such exercise. 

   

 (d) Fractional shares of Common Stock. The Company may, in accordance with _Section 2.6_ , pay the exercising holder cash in lieu of issuing a fractional share in connection with an exercise of Warrants; _provided_ that, if it does not issue a fractional share in such circumstances, it will make such cash payment. 

   

 (e) Automatic Exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Warrants issued hereunder shall be fully exercised pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, without the need for any action by the holder thereof or the Company, immediately prior to the Expiration Time, provided that upon such automatic exercise the resulting value is greater than zero. 

  

 2.2. Issuance of Common Stock. 

  

 Upon timely receipt of a Warrant Certificate, accompanied by the form of election to purchase duly executed, and payment of the Exercise Price for each of the shares of the Common Stock to be purchased (if payable in the manner provided in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_) and by an amount equal to any applicable Tax (if not payable by the Company as provided in _Section 3.3_), the Company shall thereupon promptly cause certificates representing the number of whole shares of 

   ##### 

  

 

Common Stock then being purchased to be delivered to or upon the order of the
registered holder of such Warrant Certificate, registered in such name or
names as may be designated by such holder, and, promptly after such receipt
deliver the cash, if any, to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Warrant
Certificate. 

   

 2.3. Unexercised Warrants. 

  

 In the event that the registered holder of any Warrant Certificate shall exercise less than all the Warrants evidenced thereby, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing Warrants equal in number to the number of Warrants remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Company to the registered holder of such Warrant Certificate or to its duly authorized assigns. 

  

 2.4. Cancellation and Destruction of Warrant Certificates. 

  

 All Warrant Certificates surrendered to the Company for the purpose of exercise, exchange, substitution or transfer shall be cancelled by it, and no Warrant Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall cancel and retire any other Warrant Certificates purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. 

  

 2.5. Expiration. 

  

 All Warrants that have not been exercised or purchased in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall expire and all rights of holders of such Warrants shall terminate and cease at the Expiration Time. 

  

2.6. Fractional shares of Common Stock. 

   

 The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of any Warrant. If fractional shares are not issued upon the exercise of any Warrant, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock resulting therefrom, an amount of cash equal to the product of: 

   

 (a) the fractional amount of such share of Common Stock; and 

   

 (b) the Market Price, as determined on the trading day immediately prior to the date of exercise of such Warrant. 

  

3\. AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY. 

   

 3.1. Reservation of Common Stock. 

  

 The Company covenants and agrees that it will at all times cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares of Common Stock such number of shares of Common Stock as will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all Warrants issued hereunder into Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

       | 3.2.  |   | Common Stock To Be Duly Authorized and Issued,
Fully Paid and Nonassessable etc; Compliance with Law  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Common Stock delivered upon the exercise of any Warrant and the payment of the Exercise Price pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (in each case, at the time of delivery of the certificates representing such shares of Common Stock) shall (a) be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable, free of any preemptive rights in favor of any Person in respect of such issuance and free of any security interest, pledge, mortgage, lien, charge or other encumbrance created by, or arising out of actions of, the Company (other than such rights and security interests, pledges, mortgages, liens, charges, or other encumbrances, if any, arising out of the provisions of this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement) and (b) be issued without violation of any applicable Law. 

  

3.3. Taxes. 

   

 The Company covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all Taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of the initial issuance or delivery of: 

   

 (a) each Warrant Certificate; 

   

 (b) each Warrant Certificate issued in exchange for any other Warrant Certificate pursuant to _Section 1.3_, _Section 2.3_ or _Section 4_; and 

   

 (c) each share of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of any Warrant. 

  

 The Company shall not, however, be required to: 

   

 (i) pay any Tax that may be payable in respect of the transfer or delivery of Warrant Certificates in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Warrant Certificate surrendered for exercise, conversion, transfer or exchange (any such Tax being payable by the holder of such certificate at the time of surrender); or 

   

 (ii) issue or deliver any such certificates referred to in the foregoing clause (i) until any such Tax referred to in the foregoing clause (i) shall have been paid. 

  

 3.4. Common Stock Record Date. 

  

 Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares of Common Stock is issued upon the exercise of Warrants shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Stock represented thereby on, and such certificates (if any) shall be dated, the date upon which the Warrant Certificate evidencing such Warrants was duly surrendered with an election to purchase attached thereto duly executed and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (and any applicable Taxes, if payable by such Person) was made. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.5. Rights in Respect of Common Stock. 

  

 Except as otherwise set forth herein or in the Stockholders Agreement, prior to the exercise of the Warrants evidenced thereby, the holder of a Warrant Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Common Stock into which the Warrants shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote in respect of any matter upon which the holders of Common Stock may vote, the right to receive any distributions of cash or property and, except as expressly set forth herein, in the Merger Agreement, in the Stockholders Agreement or in this Agreement, the right to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company. Prior to the exercise of the Warrants evidenced thereby, the holders of the Warrant Certificates shall not have as such any obligation in respect of any assessment or any other obligation or liability as a stockholder of the Company, whether such obligations or liabilities are asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company, but shall have the obligations set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. 

  

 3.6. Noncircumvention. 

  

 The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its charter, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant Agreement, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Warrant Agreement. 

  

4\. ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS. 

   

 4.1. Adjustments. 

  

 The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant, and the Exercise Price, shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in this _Section 4_. 

  

 4.2. Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Reclassifications or Combinations. 

  

 If the Company shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Warrants at the time of the record date for such dividend or effective date of such split, reverse split, subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of such Warrants after such date shall be entitled to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to such Warrants after such date had such Warrants been exercised immediately prior to such date. In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the effective date of such split, reverse split, subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution,
split, reverse split, subdivision, combination or reclassification giving
rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Warrants determined pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ that the Exercise Price shall
not be adjusted to be less than the par value of the Common Stock. 

   

 4.3. Price Based Anti-Dilution 

   

 (a) Without duplication of the adjustments set forth in _Sections 4.2_ or  _4.4_ , (a) if the Company shall issue or sell any shares of Common Stock (as actually issued or, pursuant to _Section 4.3(b)_, deemed to be issued) for a consideration per share less than 90% of the Market Price per share immediately prior to such issuance or sale, or if earlier, upon the execution of the definitive documentation with respect to such issuance or sale (the " _Effective Time_ "), then immediately upon the Effective Time the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Warrants at the time of the effective date shall be increased by multiplying such number of shares of Common Stock by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the Fully Diluted Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the Fully Diluted Number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued or sold would purchase if such shares were sold at Market Price. For the purposes of this _Section 4.3(a)_, none of the following issuances shall be considered the issuance or sale of Common Stock: 

   

 (i) the issuance of Common Stock upon the conversion of any then-outstanding Common Stock Equivalents; 

   

 (ii) the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents for which the adjustment provided in _Section 4.2_ applies; 

   

 (iii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents to Employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is approved by the Board of Directors; or 

   

 (iv) the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of December 3, 2002, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as amended December 13, 2006 and March 4, 2009. 

   

 (b) For the purposes of _Section 4.3(a)_, the following subparagraphs (i) to (iii), inclusive, shall also be applicable: 

   

 (i) If the Company shall grant any rights to subscribe for, or any rights or options to purchase, Common Stock Equivalents, whether or not such rights or options or the right to convert or exchange any such Common Stock Equivalents 

   ##### 

  

    

are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock
is issuable upon the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or
exchange of such Common Stock Equivalents (determined by dividing (A) the
total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration
for the granting of such rights or options, plus the minimum aggregate amount
of additional consideration payable to the Company upon the exercise of such
rights or options, plus, in the case of any such rights or options which
relate to such Common Stock Equivalents, the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue or sale of such
Common Stock Equivalents and upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (B)
the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of such rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange of all
such Common Stock Equivalents issuable upon the exercise of such rights or
options) shall be less than the Market Price per share of Common Stock
immediately prior to the time of the granting of such rights or options, or,
if earlier, the execution of definitive documentation with respect to such
grant, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such rights or options or upon conversion or exchange of the
total maximum amount of such Common Stock Equivalents issuable upon the
exercise of such rights or options shall (as of the date of granting of such
rights or options) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for
such price per share; _provided_ that no further adjustment of the conversion
price pursuant to this _Section 4.3(b)(i)_ shall be made (i) upon the actual
issuance or sale of such Common Stock Equivalents upon the exercise of any
rights to subscribe for, or any rights or options to purchase, such Common
Stock Equivalents or (ii) upon the actual issuance or sale of such Common
Stock upon the exercise of any such Common Stock Equivalents, including
without limitation, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to
shares of Common Stock Equivalents or Common Stock issued or issuable as a
result of the effect of antidilution adjustments under any such security. 

   

 (ii) If the Company shall issue or sell any Common Stock Equivalents, whether or not the rights to exchange or convert thereunder are immediately exercisable, and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (A) the total amount received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the issue or sale of such Common Stock Equivalents, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by (B) the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Common Stock Equivalents) shall be less than the Market Price per share of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of such Common Stock Equivalents shall (as of the date of the issue or sale of such Common Stock Equivalents) be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued for such price per share, _provided_ that no further adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to this  _Section 4.3(b)(ii)_ shall be made upon the actual issuance or sale of such Common 

   ##### 

  

    

Stock upon the exercise of any such Common Stock Equivalents, including
without limitation, in each case with respect to shares of Common Stock
issued or issuable as a result of the effect of antidilution adjustments
under any such security. 

   

 (iii) In case at any time any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or any rights or options to purchase any such Common Stock, or Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor. In case any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or any rights or options to purchase any such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall be deemed to be the Fair Market Value of such consideration. 

  

 4.4. Other Distributions. 

  

 In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a dividend or distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding dividends of its Common Stock and other dividends or distributions referred to in _Section 4.2_), in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades on the Exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (such amount and/or Fair Market Value, the " _Per Share Fair Market Value_ ") divided by (y) such Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any Warrants shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrants then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of shares of Common Stock that would then be issuable upon exercise of such Warrants if such record date had not been fixed. 

  

 4.5. Business Combinations. 

  

 In case of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in _Section 4.2_), a holders right to receive shares of 

   ##### 

  

 

Common Stock upon exercise of any Warrants shall be converted into the right
to exercise such Warrant to acquire the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property (including cash) which the Common Stock issuable (at
the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon exercise of
such Warrants immediately prior to such Business Combination or
reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of
such Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if
necessary, the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights
and interests thereafter of such holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as
to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to such holders right to
exercise such Warrants in exchange for any shares of stock or other
securities or property pursuant to this _Section 4.5_. In determining the
kind and amount of stock, securities or the property receivable upon exercise
of any Warrants following the consummation of such Business Combination, if
the holders of Common Stock have the right to elect the kind or amount of
consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination, then
the holder of such Warrants shall be entitled to elect the kind or amount of
consideration receivable upon consummation of such Business Combination. The
Company shall not enter into or be party to any Business Combination unless
the successor of the Company (if any), assumes in writing all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant Agreement pursuant to written
agreements, including agreements to deliver to each holder of
Warrants hereunder in exchange for such Warrants a security of such successor
evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance
to this Warrant Agreement. 

   

 4.6. Expiration of Rights or Options. 

  

 Upon the expiration of any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or convert or exchange Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents in respect of the issuance, sale or grant of which adjustment was made pursuant to _Section 4.3_, without the exercise thereof, the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant shall, upon such expiration, be readjusted and shall thereafter be such Exercise Price and such number of shares of Common Stock as would have been had such Exercise Price and such number of shares of Common Stock not been originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required, as the case may be), as if: 

   

 (a) the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such rights or options; and 

   

 (b) such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise plus the aggregate consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the issuance, sale or grant of all of such rights or options, whether or not exercised; _provided_ that no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the Exercise Price by an amount in excess of the amount of the reduction initially made in respect of the issuance, sale, or grant of such rights or options. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.7. Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments. 

  

 All calculations under this _Section 4_ shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this _Section 4_ to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which any Warrants are exercisable shall be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a share of Common Stock, or more. 

  

 4.8. Timing of Issuance of Additional Common Stock Upon Certain Adjustments. 

  

 In any case in which the provisions of this _Section 4_ shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the holder of any Warrants exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock; _provided, however_ , that the Company upon request shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holders right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. 

  

 4.9. Miscellaneous. 

   

 (a) Statement Regarding Adjustments. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which any Warrants are exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in _Section 4_, the Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company referenced in _Section 6.6_ a statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Warrants shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the Company shall also cause a copy of such statement to be sent by mail, first class postage prepaid, to each holder of Warrants at the address appearing in the Companys records. 

   

 (b) Notice of Adjustment Event. In the event that the Company shall propose to take any action of the type described in this _Section 4_ (but only if the action of the type described in this _Section 4_ would result in an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock into which Warrants are exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of Warrants), the Company shall give notice to the holders of Warrants, in the manner set forth in _Section 4.9(a)_, which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take place. Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect 

   ##### 

  

    

on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other
securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of any
Warrants. In the case of any action which would require the fixing of a
record date, such notice shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date so
fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least
15 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent notice of any of the foregoing actions or events is
given to the holders of the Common Stock, such notice shall be provided to
the holders of the Warrants on or before such notice to the holders of Common
Stock. 

   

 (c) Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment. As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to this _Section 4_ , the Company shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market or other applicable national securities exchange (an " _Exchange_ ") or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of Common Stock that the holders are entitled to receive upon exercise of this any Warrants pursuant to this _Section 4_. 

   

 (d) Adjustment Rules. Any adjustments pursuant to this _Section 4_ shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur. If more than one subsection of this _Section 4_ is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this _Section 4_ so as to result in duplication. If an adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder would reduce the Exercise Price to an amount below par value of the Common Stock, then such adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder shall reduce the Exercise Price to the par value of the Common Stock.

ATTACHMENT A 

   

[FORM OF WARRANT CERTIFICATE] 

  

 THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT IN A TRANSACTION REGISTERED UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

  

 THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A CERTAIN WARRANT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF _ _, 20___, THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE FROM THE COMPANY UPON REQUEST.

     No. WR-   |   | _ _Warrants  
   Date: _ _, 20___   |   | PPN # _

 This Warrant Certificate certifies that _ _ _ _, or registered assigns, is the registered holder of _ _ ( _ _)Warrants. Each Warrant entitles the owner thereof to purchase at any time on or after the date hereof and on or prior to the Expiration Time, one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $.001 par value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of BIOSCRIP, INC., a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the " _Company_ "), at a purchase price (subject to adjustment as provided in the Warrant Agreement (as defined below), the " _Exercise Price_ ") of $10.00 per share of Common Stock upon presentation and surrender of this Warrant Certificate to the Company with a duly executed election to purchase and payment of the Exercise Price, all in the manner set forth in the Warrant Agreement (defined below). The number of shares of Common Stock that may be initially purchased upon exercise of each Warrant and the Exercise Price are the number and the Exercise Price as of the date hereof, and are subject to adjustment as referred to below. 

  

 The Warrants are issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement (as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented, the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), dated as of _ _, 20___, among the Company and the Purchasers named therein, and are subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions thereof, which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof and to which Warrant Agreement reference is hereby made for a full 

   ##### 

  

 

description of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Company
and the holders of the Warrant Certificates. Capitalized terms used, but not
defined, herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Warrant
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Warrant Certificate and
the Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Agreement shall control and govern. 

   

 As provided in the Warrant Agreement, the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are, upon the happening of certain events, subject to modification and adjustment. Except as otherwise set forth in, and subject to, the Warrant Agreement, the Expiration Time of this Warrant Certificate is as set forth in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 This Warrant Certificate shall be exercisable, at the election of the holder, at any time on or after the date hereof and on or prior to the Expiration Time either as an entirety or in part from time to time. If this Warrant Certificate shall be exercised in part, the holder shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender hereof, another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates for the number of Warrants not exercised. This Warrant Certificate, with or without other Warrant Certificates, upon surrender in the manner set forth in the Warrant Agreement and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, may be transferred or exchanged for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing Warrants entitling the holder to purchase a like aggregate number of shares of Common Stock as the Warrants evidenced by the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates surrendered shall have entitled such holder to purchase. 

  

 Except as expressly set forth in the Warrant Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement, no holder of this Warrant Certificate shall be entitled to vote or receive distributions or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares of Common Stock or of any other Securities of the Company that may at any time be issued upon the exercise hereof, nor shall anything contained in the Warrant Agreement or herein be construed to confer upon the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a holder of a share of Common Stock in the Company or any right to vote upon any matter submitted to holders of shares of Common Stock at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action of the Company (whether upon any recapitalization, issuance of stock, reclassification of Securities, change of par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance, or otherwise), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Warrant or Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate shall have been exercised as provided in the Warrant Agreement. 

  

 THIS WARRANT CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDER HEREOF SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RULES WOULD REQUIRE OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW SPECIFICALLY AND MANDATORILY APPLIES.
