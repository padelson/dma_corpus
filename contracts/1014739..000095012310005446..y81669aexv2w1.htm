operating loss generated in such period (if any) will be carried back or carried forward. The
Stockholders&#146; Representative shall provide, or cause to be provided, a draft of any such Tax

by the Stockholders and the Parent.

reasonable objections Stockholders&#146; Representative may have to any items set forth in such draft
Straddle Return and the Parent and Stockholders&#146; Representative agree to consult and resolve in

Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, against the cost and expense of such defense, including
without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel. If any conflicting
demand shall be made upon the Escrow Agent, it shall not be required to determine the same or take
any action thereon and may await settlement of the controversy by appropriate and non-appealable
legal proceedings. Upon the commencement of any action against or otherwise involving the Escrow
Agent with respect to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
interplead the matter of this escrow in the Chosen Court (as defined in Section&nbsp;13 of this
Agreement) and, in such event, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of and discharged from any and
all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement. In any such action, the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to the indemnities provided in Section&nbsp;7 below.

Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that

anniversary of the Closing Date, holders of then-outstanding Stockholder Shares shall have the
right to require the Company to effect unlimited registrations on Form S-3, or any successor form
then in effect, under the Securities Act (any such registration, a &#147;<U>Demand Registration</U>&#148;).
Upon receipt from a Stockholder or Stockholders (the &#147;<U>Initiating Stockholders</U>&#148;) of any
request for a Demand Registration for Common Stock having a market value of not less than
$25,000,000, based on the closing price of the Common Stock at 4:00 p.m. on the business day prior
to the day of the request, the Company shall give prompt (but in any event not later than two (2)
business days after receipt of such request) written notice of such request to each Stockholder,
and shall include in such Demand Registration all Stockholder Shares with respect to which the
Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within 30&nbsp;days after the delivery of
the Company&#146;s notice. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the
registration statement with regard to such Demand Registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after it receives a request therefor, and to cause such
registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter. If requested by the
Initiating Stockholders, the Company shall take steps as are required to register such Stockholder
Shares in such Demand Registration for sale on a continuous basis under Rule&nbsp;415 under the
Securities Act and keep such registration statement (or any replacement registration statement
effected upon the expiration of the initial or any subsequent registration statement) effective for
such period as is necessary to complete the sale and distribution of all of the Stockholder Shares
pursuant thereto, but in any event not longer than one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days. No later than
the effective date of the Demand Registration, the Company shall furnish (or cause to be furnished)
to the Company&#146;s transfer agent, from time to time, an opinion of the Company&#146;s counsel to
facilitate the transfer of the Stockholder Shares in the secondary market, including, but not
limited to, the removal of any restrictive legends encumbering such shares. If other securities
are included in any Demand Registration that is an underwritten offering, and the managing
underwriter for such offering advises the Company that in its opinion the number of securities to
be included exceeds the number of securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the marketability or price thereof, the Company will include in such registration all
Stockholder Shares requested to be included therein prior to the inclusion of any securities that
are not Stockholder Shares. If the number of Stockholder Shares requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number of securities which in the opinion of such underwriter can be sold
without adversely affecting the marketability of such offering, such Stockholder Shares shall be
included pro rata among the holders thereof based on the percentage of the outstanding Stockholder
Shares then held by each such Stockholder. If other securities are included in any Demand
Registration that is not an underwritten offering, all Stockholder Shares included in such Demand
Registration shall be sold prior to the sale of any of such other securities. The Company shall
have the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer any Demand
Registration that is an underwritten offering, subject to the approval of the holders of a majority
of the Stockholder Shares to be included in such Demand Registration.

accounting fees, charges or expenses incurred by the Company incident to or required by any such

incident to or required by any registration or qualification), and (vi)&nbsp;to the extent the Company
determines to obtain such insurance, any liability insurance or other premiums for insurance

registration or shelf registration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, regardless of whether
such registration statement is declared effective, but excluding any underwriting discounts or
commissions on the sale of Stockholder Shares or the fees and expenses of any additional counsel
retained by the Stockholders. As a condition to the inclusion of Stockholder Shares in any
registration, the participating Stockholders and the Company shall execute a customary underwriting
agreement or similar agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and the
underwriter(s), if any, for such offering containing customary indemnification and holdback
provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Stockholder shall be required to incur
indemnification obligations (whether several or joint and several) which are in excess of the net
proceeds received by such Stockholder pursuant to such registration or relates to information not
supplied by such Stockholder for inclusion in the registration statement.
