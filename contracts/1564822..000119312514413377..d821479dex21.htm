(c) _Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and Proposed Final Closing
Statement_. As promptly as possible and in any event within sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, and will provide to the Sellers Representative, a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(the " _Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a written
statement setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed final determination
of the Net Working Capital (including the Seller Transaction Expenses), as
derived from the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet, and the Closing Debt Amount,
as derived from the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Proposed Final
Closing Statement_ "). The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
determination of Net Working Capital (including the Seller Transaction
Expenses) and the Closing Debt Amount reflected on the Proposed Final Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
Neither the Company nor the Buyer will amend, supplement or modify the
Proposed Final Closing Statement following its delivery to the Sellers
Representative. The Buyer shall afford the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the work
papers and other books and records of the Company Entities and any accountants
retained by the Company Entities for purposes of assisting the Sellers
Representative and its Representatives in their review of the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement.

(d) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet and
the Proposed Final Closing Statement (and the proposed final determinations
of the Net Working Capital (including the Seller Transaction Expenses) and the
Closing Debt Amount reflected thereon) will be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties unless the Sellers Representative provides a written notice
(a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer no later than the twentieth (20th)
Business Day after the delivery to the Sellers Representative of the Proposed
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement. Any
Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the
Proposed Final Closing Balance Sheet or the Proposed Final Closing Statement
which the Sellers Representative believes has not been prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the correct amount of such item and (ii)
the Sellers Representatives alternative calculation of the Net Working
Capital (including the Seller Transaction Expenses) and the Closing Debt
Amount, as applicable. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in the
Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties on such
twentieth (20th) Business Day.

 

(e) _Resolution of Disputes_. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative will
attempt to promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good
faith. Beginning ten (10) Business Days after delivery of any Dispute Notice
pursuant to _Section 2.06(d)_, either the Buyer

 



\- 15 - or the Sellers Representative may provide written notice to the other (the "
_Dispute Submission Notice_ ") that it elects to submit the disputed items to
a nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen jointly by the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the
event that an Accounting Firm has not been selected by mutual agreement of
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative within ten (10) Business Days
following the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice, each of the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall promptly select an accounting firm and
promptly cause such two accounting firms to mutually select a third
independent accounting firm to act as the Accounting Firm within twenty (20)
Business Days of the giving of the Dispute Submission Notice. The Accounting
Firm will promptly, in accordance with such procedures as it deems fair and
equitable, provided that each party shall be afforded an opportunity to submit
a written statement in favor of its position and to advocate for its position
orally before the Accounting Firm, review only those unresolved items and
amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice. The
Accounting Firm will resolve the dispute by selecting either (i) the Sellers
Representatives calculation of Net Working Capital (including the Seller
Transaction Expenses) and the Closing Debt Amount as set forth on the Dispute
Notice (as modified following discussions with the Buyer and as submitted
to the Accounting Firm at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a
copy to the Buyer) or (ii) the Buyers calculation of Net Working Capital
(including the Seller Transaction Expenses) and the Closing Debt Amount as set
forth on the Proposed Final Closing Statement (as modified following
discussions with the Sellers Representative and as submitted to the
Accounting Firm at the outset of the dispute resolution process with a copy to
the Sellers Representative), based upon the submission which results in an
adjustment to the Aggregate Consideration that is closest to the correct
adjustment as determined by the Accounting Firm after resolution of the
disputed items. In any such case, a single partner of the Accounting Firm
selected by such Accounting Firm in accordance with its normal procedures and
having expertise with respect to settlement of such disputes and the industry
in which Company operates shall act for the Accounting Firm in
the determination proceeding, and the Accounting Firm shall render a written
decision with respect to such disputed matter, including a statement in
reasonable detail of the basis for its decision. All of the fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) (in the event that Buyers positions are adopted by the
Accounting Firm) or the Buyer (in the event that the Sellers Representatives
positions are adopted by the Accounting Firm). The decision of the Accounting
Firm with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. As used herein, the Proposed Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Final Closing Statement, as adjusted to
reflect any changes agreed to by the parties and the decision of the
Accounting Firm, in each case, pursuant to this  _Section 2.06_, are
referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final
Closing Statement_ ", respectively. Each of the parties to this Agreement
agrees to cooperate with the Accounting Firm (including by executing a
customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the
commencement of the Accounting Firms engagement.

 

(f) _Aggregate Consideration Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital
(including the Seller Transaction Expenses) or the Closing Debt Amount (as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ and as set forth in the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement) differs from the
estimated amounts thereof set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement,
the Aggregate Consideration shall be recalculated using such final figures in
lieu of such estimated

 



\- 16 - figures, and (i) the Buyer (with respect to the portion to be distributed to
the Sellers) and the Company (with respect to the portion, if any, to be
distributed to the holders of Options) shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the holders of Options,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
the Sellers Representative, the amount, if any, by which such re-calculated
final Aggregate Consideration exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Consideration
_plus_ any interest pursuant to  _Section 2.06(g)_ or (ii) the Escrow Agent
shall, and the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall cause the Escrow
Agent to, transfer to the Buyer out of the Price Adjustment Escrow Account, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, and the Company shall retain in
accordance with _Section 2.07_ an aggregate amount equal to the amount, if
any, by which such Estimated Aggregate Consideration exceeds such re-
calculated final Aggregate Consideration  _plus_ any interest pursuant to
_Section 2.06(g)_ (with the amount released from the Price Adjustment Escrow
Account being determined with reference to the Pro Rata Portions of the
Sellers), provided that if such amount exceeds $500,000, the Sellers
severally based on their respective Pro Rata Portions, and not jointly, shall
promptly pay to the Buyer the amount of such excess. Any of the Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount not paid to the Buyer pursuant to this  _Section
2.06(f)_ shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, promptly following the determination
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement pursuant

date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect from time to time during
the period from the Interest Commencement Date to the date of payment. Such
interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates
and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed.

and this Agreement. In connection with the Closing, the Company will, and the
Buyer will cause the Company to, deposit a portion of the Aggregate

of any time, the amount of the Option Holdback Amount then held by the
Company pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Option Holdback Funds_ ") into an

distribute to the holders of Options from the Option Holdback Funds an amount
equal to that portion of the Option Holdback Funds that bears the same

Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Tax Escrow Fund and the Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund (before giving effect to the disbursement of the Seller Release
Amount) and (ii) to the extent that all or any portion of the amount held by

the Option Holdback Funds that bears the same proportion as the Buyer Release
Amount bears to the amount held in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Tax
Escrow Fund and the Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (before giving effect to the
disbursement of the Buyer Release Amount) (and, for greater certainty, the
holders of Options shall have no entitlement to the amount so retained by the
Company). Any amounts to be further distributed in respect of

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

Section 6.01 _[Reserved]_.

 

Section 6.02 _Access to Premises and Information_. From and after the Closing
Date, in connection with any Tax matter or the determination of any matter
relating to the rights or obligations of any Seller or any of its Affiliates
under this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, upon reasonable prior
notice and as determined in good faith to be appropriate to ensure compliance
with any applicable Legal Requirement and subject to any applicable privileges
(including the attorney-client privilege) and contractual confidentiality
obligations, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company and each Company Subsidiary) and their
respective Representatives to, afford to the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
offices, employees, properties, books and records of the Company Entities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such requests shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Buyer, the Company Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if any Seller and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer, the Company Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are in an adversarial
relationship in litigation or arbitration, the furnishing of information,
documents or records in accordance with this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject
to applicable rules relating to discovery. This _Section 6.02_ shall in no
way limit the Sellers rights pursuant to  _Section 2.06_ of this Agreement.

Section 6.03 _Employee Benefits_. With respect to any employee benefit
plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy that is made available after
the Closing Date to any employees of the Company Entities who are so employed
as of the Closing Date, including any such Person who is on an legally
mandated or other approved leave of absence (the " _Affected Employees_ "),
service with any Company Entity by any such Affected Employee prior to the
Closing Date shall be credited for purposes of determining eligibility and
vesting and for purposes of determining benefits and accruals (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans) to the
extent permitted by the terms of such plan, program, agreement, arrangement or
policy and applicable Legal Requirements. The Buyer shall recognize vacation
days previously accrued and reserved for by the Company Entities immediately
prior to the Closing Date. For a period of not less than twelve months after
the Closing Date, for each Affected Employee, the Buyer shall cause the
Company Entities to (i) provide annual base salary or base rate of pay and
annual cash bonus opportunities that that are, in each case, no less favorable
as those provided by the Company Entities immediately prior to Closing
and (ii) other benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided by the Company Entities immediately prior to Closing.
Furthermore and without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to
specifically make year-end bonus payments to the Affected Employees for
fiscal year 2014 consistent with the Companys past practices and the
financial results of the business to the extent that such bonus payments have
been fully accrued and included in the Net Working Capital with respect to
the period prior to Closing; provided, however, in any event, the Buyer agrees
to make payments to any Affected Employee whose employment is terminated other
than for just cause prior to any year-end bonus payment for fiscal year 2014
in an amount equal to the payment that such Affected Employee would have
otherwise been entitled to receive in the event the Affected Employee was
still employed at the time of such payment prorated for the portion of fiscal
year 2014 that the Affected Employee was employed by the Company to the
extent that such bonus payments have been fully accrued and included in the
Net Working Capital with respect to the period prior to Closing. Nothing
contained in this _Section 6.03_, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person not a party hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any right to

 



\- 36 -  employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Company Plan.

 

Section 6.04 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) _Confidentiality of the Sellers_.

 

(i) Each of the Sellers and the Sellers Representative hereby severally
agrees with the Buyer and the Company (on its own behalf and on behalf of the
Company Entities) that such Seller or Sellers Representative, its Affiliates
and its and its Affiliates Representatives shall not, and that such Seller or
Sellers Representative shall cause its Affiliates and such Representatives
not to, at any time after the Closing, directly or indirectly, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, disclose, any non-public or confidential
information involving or relating to the Business or any Company Entity
(other than in the case of a Seller that is a director, officer or employee of
the Company, in the course of fulfilling his or her duties to the Company in
such capacity). The Sellers and Sellers Representative shall not be liable
under this _Section 6.04(a)(i)_ with respect to any disclosure that is
determined by Sellers Representative or such Seller (with the advice of
counsel) to be required by any applicable Legal Requirement, in which case
the disclosing party will (i) to the extent permissible by such applicable
Legal Requirement, provide the Buyer with prompt written notice of such
requirement to afford the Buyer and the Company to contest the same, (ii)
disclose only that information that it determines (with the advice of
counsel) is required by such applicable Legal Requirement to be disclosed and
(iii) use reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-
public information, including by, at the Buyers request, reasonably
cooperating with the Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such non-
public information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public
information shall not include information that (A) is or becomes available to,
or known by, the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by Sellers
Representative, a Seller or their Affiliates or Representatives in violation
of this _Section 6.04(a)(i)_) or (B) becomes available to Sellers
Representative, a Seller or their Affiliates or Representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than any Company Entity, the Buyer,
any Seller, the Sellers Representative or any Affiliate or Representative of
any of the foregoing if the source of such information is not known by such
Sellers Representative, a Seller, Affiliate or Representative, after due
inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Buyer,
any Company Entity or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section
6.04(a)(i)_ will not prohibit any disclosure made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto and their
respective Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
Contemplated Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or
other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure.

 



\- 37 - Section 6.05 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party will
pay its own respective financial advisory, legal, accounting and other
expenses incurred by it or for its benefit in connection with the preparation
and execution of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the compliance
herewith and therewith and the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , that
the Seller Transaction Expenses not paid prior to Closing or paid or payable
by the Company Entities pursuant to _Section 2.04(r)_ shall be included in
the Net Working Capital.

 

Section 6.06 _Publicity_. The initial public announcement regarding the
Contemplated Transactions shall be a joint press release of Buyer and
Sellers Representative. No public announcement or disclosure may be made by
any party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consents of both the Buyer
and the Sellers Representative; _provided_ , that the provisions of this
_Section 6.06_ shall not prohibit (a) any disclosure required by any
applicable Legal Requirements (in which case the disclosing party will provide
the other parties with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in
advance of such disclosure (including the right to request confidential
treatment of any information)) or any disclosure made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 6.06_ or _Section 6.04_, on and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers Representative and its Affiliates shall be
permitted (x) to disclose to their respective and prospective members, limited
partners and stockholders (who may disclose to their direct and indirect
investors) the fact that the Closing has occurred, the consideration paid
hereunder, other items directly relating to such consideration and other types
of information that are customary for private equity funds to provide to their
respective and prospective members, limited partners and stockholders and (y)
to disclose in connection with normal fund raising and related marketing or
informational or reporting activities of the Sellers Representative and/or
any such Affiliate, including on their websites and in their marketing
materials, any such information permitted to be disclosed pursuant to clause
(x) above and any information previously provided as part of a press release
or public announcement issued or made with the prior written consent of Buyer
and the Sellers Representative, which disclosure may be accompanied by the
logo of the Company.

Section 6.07 _Attorney-Client Privilege_. Each of the Buyer, the Sellers and
the Sellers Representative agrees that it and the Company shall take all
steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Ropes and
Gray LLP; Mogan Daniels Slager LLP or other counsel from time to time
retained by the Company prior to the Closing (collectively, " _Prior Company
Counsel_ "), whether or not in connection with the Contemplated Transaction,
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect; provided that from and
after the Closing such privilege shall be controlled by the Sellers and not
the Company. In addition, each of the Buyer, the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative waives, and agrees to cause the Company to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with (i) Prior Company Counsel
representing the Sellers or the Sellers Representative after the Closing and
(ii) the communication by Prior Company Counsel to the Sellers or the
Sellers Representative, in any such representation, of any fact known to
Prior Company Counsel, including in connection with any negotiation,
arbitration, mediation, litigation or other proceeding in any way related to a
dispute with either

 



\- 38 - Buyer or the Company following the Closing, and the disclosure of any such
fact in connection with any process undertaken for the resolution of such
dispute. Each of the Buyer, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative
acknowledges that it and the Company have had the opportunity to discuss and
obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks
of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and
other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This _Section 6.07_ is for the
benefit of the Sellers, Sellers Representative and Prior Company Counsel, and
Prior Company Counsel is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section
6.07_. This _Section 6.07_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
_Section 6.07_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative and the Prior Company Counsel affected
thereby.

 

Section 6.08 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause each of the directors
of the Company Entities to tender a resignation to act as a director, which
resignation shall be effective as of the Closing. Each such resignation shall
be accompanied by a mutual release substantially in the form attached as
_Schedule F_ hereto.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will
not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the
Companys certificate or articles of amendment, bylaws or other equivalent
governing documents, or in any contract or agreement disclosed in _Section
6.08_ of the Disclosure Schedule, relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and
directors (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") (unless required by law or
other Governmental Authority), it being the intent of the parties that the
officers and directors of the Company will continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of
the law.

 

(c) The Company has obtained and the Buyer shall, following the Closing,
maintain an irrevocable pre-paid "tail" insurance policy naming the DandO
Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least
six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Tail Policy_ "). 50% of the
costs and expenses of such Tail Policy shall be included as a Seller
Transaction Expense. Buyer will not, and will cause the Company Entities to
not, cancel or change such Tail Policy in any respect.

 

(d) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, then Buyer
and the Company will, and in each such case, ensure that the successors and
assigns of the Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.08_. The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ will apply to all of
the successors and assigns of the Company.

 



\- 39 - Section 6.09 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall be responsible for and pay all stock transfer Taxes, real
property transfer or mortgage Taxes, sales Taxes, documentary stamp Taxes,
recording charges and other similar Taxes, if any, arising from the purchase
and sale of the Shares hereunder. Each of the parties hereto shall prepare and
file, and shall fully cooperate with each other party with respect to
the preparation and filing of, any Tax Returns and other filings relating to
any such Taxes or charges as may be required.

(b) The Buyer will cause the Company Entities to file all Tax Returns of the
Company Entities that are required to be filed after the Closing that relate
to taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date and such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the last previous such Tax
Return filed by the Company, unless otherwise required by Legal Requirements.
The Buyer shall provide to the Sellers Representative for its review a draft
of each such Tax Return no later than 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. The
Sellers Representative shall notify the Buyer in writing within 15 days after
delivery of such Tax Return if it has any reasonable comments with respect to
items set forth therein.

(c) Any Tax Benefit that is attributable to any taxable period or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, plus any interest actually
received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authority (less an
amount for applicable taxes calculated as if the amount of any loss carry-
forward was nil and less an amount equal to the any reduction in any tax
attribute, tax credit, or tax deduction to which the recipient would have been
entitled but for the receipt of the Tax Benefit), shall be for the account of
the Sellers and the holders of Options and shall be paid by the Buyer to the
Sellers Representative within 30 days after the receipt of such refund or the
filing of the Tax Return in which the credit is applied against any Taxes of
the Company, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates; provided that the amount
of the Tax Benefit was not otherwise reflected in the Financials at the
Closing and provided further that the amount exceeds the lesser of the (i) the
amount of Losses for the purposes of _Section 8.01(a)_ and (ii) the
Deductible for the purposes of _Section 8.01(b)_. At the direction of and at
the sole cost and expense the Sellers, the Buyer shall file for, or cause to
be filed for, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the receipt of,
any Tax refund or credit to which the Sellers could be entitled under this
_Section 6.09(c)_, including if so requested by the Sellers Representative
by permitting the Sellers Representative to control the prosecution and
content of any such refund or credit claim. The Buyer shall promptly furnish
to the Sellers Representative such information as the Sellers Representative
may reasonably request with respect to Tax matters relating to the Company for
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date.

(d) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the US Asset Transfer and the
steps described in  _Section 2.04(m)_ shall not be taken into account in
determining (A) any obligation of Sellers, including the amount of the Net
Working Capital, Closing Debt Amount or any other item affecting the
determination of the Aggregate Consideration, or (B) whether a
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement (other than the covenants and obligations to complete the US
Asset Transfer) has been breached or not complied with, and (ii) the Buyer
shall bear any direct or indirect consequences incurred by the Company
Entities in connection with the US Asset Transfer and the steps described in
_Section 2.04(m)_, including Taxes and other liabilities, as well
as implementation costs and expenses and liabilities. The Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that an election will not be filed pursuant to subsection 184(3) of
the Income Tax Act with respect to any capital dividends deemed paid pursuant
to  _Section 2.04(m)_ without the concurrence of the Sellers deemed to
receive such capital dividends.

 



\- 40 - Section 6.10 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, upon the
request of either the Sellers Representative, the Buyer or the Company, each
of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other
instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry
out the Contemplated Transactions. The Buyer hereby irrevocably appoints
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC as its agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for purposes
of the Escrow Agreement, with full and exclusive power and authority to act
on the Buyers behalf in respect of the Escrow Agreement, and the Buyer will
cause Pinnacle Foods Group LLC to act only on its behalf (and on behalf of the
other Buyer Indemnified Persons) and in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as if the Buyer were a party to the
Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.01  _Termination of the Agreement_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Contemplated Transactions may be abandoned if the Closing
has not occurred within one (1) Business Day of the Scheduled Closing Date (i)

Sellers Representative nor the Company is in breach of its obligations
hereunder and (b) the Sellers Representative has irrevocably confirmed by

(Publicity), _9.08_ (Governing Law), _9.09_ (Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of
Process) and _9.11_ (Waiver of Jury Trial), which shall survive such

and all other rights and Liabilities of the parties hereunder will terminate
without any liability of any party to any other party, except for liabilities
arising in respect of material breaches under this Agreement by any party
prior to such termination.

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION.

 

Section 8.01 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
VIII_ , including the monetary limitations limiting recovery in respect of
certain Losses to the Indemnification Escrow Fund or the Tax Escrow Fund, as
applicable, each Seller shall severally (and not jointly) in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Portions (or in the case of clauses (i)(B)
and (ii)(B)

 



\- 41 -  below, severally and solely as to itself), indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company
Entities) (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Person_ ") from, against and in
respect of any and all losses, damages, assessments, fines, penalties, fees,
costs, expenses or amounts paid in settlement (in each case, including
reasonable attorneys and experts fees and expenses), whether or not
involving a Third Party Claim (collectively, " _Losses_ "), incurred or
suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons or any of them as a result of, in
connection with or caused by:

 

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
(A) the Company in _Article III_ of this Agreement or (B) by such Seller in
_Article IV_ of this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of (A) the Sellers
Representative in this Agreement or (B) such Seller in this Agreement.

(i) No claim may be made by the Buyer Indemnified Persons, and the Sellers
shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person,
pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of the Fundamental
Representations and the Tax Representations) in respect of Losses unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by the
Buyer Indemnified Persons exceeds $1,750,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") (at which
point the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be indemnified only for all such
Losses in excess of such amount). For greater certainty, the limitation
in this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not apply to claims in respect of the
Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations.

 

(ii) The aggregate liability of the Sellers in respect of all claims for
indemnification pursuant to  _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of

of the Sellers in respect of all claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.01(a)(i)_ in respect of the Tax Representations and pursuant to
_Section 8.01(a)(iii)_ will not exceed the dollar amount of the Tax Escrow
Fund. The aggregate liability of each Seller in respect of all claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)_ will not exceed the amount of
the portion of the Aggregate Consideration actually received by such Seller.

 

(iii) The limitations set forth in this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall not apply in
the case of fraud which cannot be waived under applicable Legal Requirements
(it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties that nothing in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, expressed or implied, constitutes a
waiver of fraud).

 



\- 42 - Section 8.02 _Indemnification by the Buyer_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
VIII_ , the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
Affiliates (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ "), from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified
Persons or any of them as a result of, in connection with or caused by:

(i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
the Buyer in _Article V_ of this Agreement; and

(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the Buyer in or
pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) _Monetary Limitations_.

 

(i) The Buyer will have no obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Persons pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ (other than in respect of
Fundamental Representations) in respect of Losses unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by the Seller
Indemnified Persons exceeds the Deductible (at which point the Buyer

excess of such amount). For greater certainty, the limitation in this _Section
8.02(b)(i)_ shall not apply to claims in respect of the Fundamental
Representations.

 

(ii) The Buyers aggregate liability in respect of all claims for

the case of fraud which cannot be waived under applicable Legal Requirements
(it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties that nothing in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, expressed or implied, constitutes a
waiver of fraud).

 

Section 8.03 _Survival; Time for Claims; Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) _Survival_. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
(and the indemnification obligation set forth in  _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_)
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the
date that is eighteen months from the Closing Date; provided, however, that
the representations and warranties in  _Section 3.01_, _Section 3.02_,
_Section 3.05_, _Section 3.25_, _Section 4.01_, _Section 4.02_, _Section
4.05_, _Section 5.01_, _Section 5.02_, and  _Section 5.06_ (the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") shall remain in full force and effect until
the date that is five years from the Closing Date. All covenants and
agreements of the parties contained herein shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims
asserted in good faith and in writing by a notice in accordance with _Section
8.03(c)_ from any Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Party prior to
the expiration date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be
barred by the expiration of the foregoing survival periods and the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant and such claims shall survive until
finally resolved.

 



\- 43 - (b) _Time for Claims_. No claim may be made or suit instituted pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ after the end of the applicable survival period set forth
in _Section 8.03(a)_.

(c) _Written Notice of Indemnification Claims_. In the event that any
Indemnified Person wishes to make a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Person shall give written notice of such
claim to each Indemnifying Party as promptly as reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of the claim. Any such notice shall describe the breach or
inaccuracy and other material facts and circumstances upon which such claim is
based and the estimated amount of Losses involved, in each case,
in reasonable detail in light of the facts then known to the Indemnified
Person; _provided_ , that no delay in notice or defect in the information
contained in such notice from the Indemnified Person to any Indemnifying Party
will relieve such Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this _Article
VIII_ , except to the extent such delay or failure to include information
actually and materially prejudices such Indemnifying Party (it being agreed
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be so prejudiced if the actual Losses
involved exceed the estimated amount set forth in such notice). For greater
certainty, the estimated amount of Losses set forth in such notice shall not
limit the amount of Losses in respect of which the Indemnified Person is
indemnified against thereunder.

Section 8.04 _Loss Calculation; Escrow Funds_.

 

(a) _Exclusion of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise, no party hereto or any of its Affiliates shall
have liability for any (i) speculative or punitive damages or damages based on
lost profits or (ii) damages that are not reasonably foreseeable as a
proximate result of the breach in question except, in each case, to
the extent, if any, one of the parties hereto is held liable for such damages
to a third party and such party is entitled to be indemnified by any of the
other parties hereto pursuant to this _Article VIII_.

 

(b) _Indemnification Escrow Fund_. The Buyer agrees that any and all amounts
payable as a result of any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)_ (other than in respect of the
Tax Representations and Tax Matters, which recourse thereto shall exclusively
be made against the Tax Escrow Fund) shall be paid solely out of
the Indemnification Escrow Fund (other than in respect of claims with respect
to breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the Fundamental Representations and claims
with respect to breaches or violations of any covenant or agreement) and, in
any case, shall be paid, in the first instance, out of the Indemnification
Escrow Fund to the extent thereof. If the Indemnification Escrow Fund is not
sufficient to pay the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any indemnification claim
with respect to breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the Fundamental
Representations or any claim with respect to breaches or violations of any
covenant or agreement, then subject to the limitations in this _Article VIII_
(including the limitations in  _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_), each Seller shall be
liable for its Pro Rata Portion (or severally and solely as to itself as the
case may be) of any Losses in respect of such claims and the Buyer may pursue
such claim directly against the Sellers, as applicable.

(c) _Tax Escrow Fund_. The Buyer agrees that any and all amounts payable as a
result of any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(i)_ in respect of the Tax Representations and
pursuant to _Section 8.01(a)(iii)_ shall be paid solely out of the Tax Escrow
Fund to the extent thereof.

 



\- 44 - (d) _Benefits_. The calculation of any Loss subject to indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ will reflect and be offset by (i) the amount of any Tax
Benefit actually recognized by the Indemnified Persons (disregarding the
consummation of the US Asset Transfer for purposes of the determination) and
(ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Persons in respect of such Loss. If any Tax Benefit described in
clause (i) of the preceding sentence or insurance benefit described in clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence is received by an Indemnified Person but any
Loss actually paid by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ was not
reduced by such benefit actually received, the Indemnified Person shall pay an
amount equal to such benefit received by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Indemnifying Party within three (3) Business Days of
receipt of such benefit.

(e)  _Loss Mitigation_. The Buyer and the Sellers shall, and the Buyer shall
cause the Company to, take reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Losses with respect to which indemnification may be requested
hereunder.

(f) _No Obligation to Indemnify_. No party hereto shall be obligated to
indemnify any other Person with respect to any Losses with respect to any
matter to the extent such matter was included in the calculation of the
adjustment to the Estimated Aggregate Consideration pursuant to  _Section
2.06(b)_.

Section 8.05 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) _Notice of Third Party Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
Person of written notice of the assertion of a claim (which shall include any
examination, audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes even if no deficiency
or assessment has yet been asserted) by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to an Indemnity
Claim against an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ , the
Indemnified Person shall give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
describing the claim and the basis for indemnification in a reasonably
complete basis in light of the facts then known to the Indemnified Person and
any other information required by _Section 8.03(c)_. No delay on the part of
the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligations under this _Article VIII_ , except to
the extent such delay actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Party (it being agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not be so prejudiced
if the actual Losses involved exceed the estimated amount set forth in such
notice).

(b) _Assumption of Defense, etc_. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified
Person within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Person, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person, and the Indemnified Person shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party is any Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense
of any such Third Party Claim that (i) is asserted directly by or on behalf of
a Person that is a Top Supplier or Top Customer, (ii) seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates, (iii) such Third Party Claim is for Losses which would reasonably
be expected to exceed one and one half times the

 



\- 45 -  amount for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Person hereunder, or (iv) such Third Party Claim relates to or
otherwise arises in connection with any criminal enforcement Action. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
_Section 8.05(c)_, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Person. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to
the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees,
disbursements and other costs of such counsel shall be at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnified Person, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Person there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Person. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim,
fails to notify the Indemnified Person in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement within such 30 day period, or otherwise fails to
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim diligently, the Indemnified
Person may enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry
of any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement
effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim.

(c) _Limitations on Indemnifying Party Control_. The Indemnifying Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment
by the Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (ii)
involves no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Person and (iii) provides an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Person from all Liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim.

 

Section 8.06 _Scope of Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
EACH OF THE BUYER AND SELLERS MAKES NO, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS, AND WAIVES

the Company Entities or their respective Affiliates.

 



\- 46 - (b) Inclusion of a matter on the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a

such matter does, or may, be material or have a Material Adverse Effect.
Matters may be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement for
purposes of information only.

Section 8.07 _Certain other Indemnity Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or otherwise, except in connection with a dispute under

Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons as against any Person

 (other than claims based on fraud which cannot be waived under applicable
Legal Requirements (it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties that
nothing in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, expressed or implied,
constitutes a waiver of fraud)) (and subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article VIII_). For greater certainty, the parties shall be permitted
to bring or commence an Action in accordance with _Section 9.09_ to enforce
their rights under this  _Article VIII_.

Section 8.08 _Effect of Investigation_. An Indemnified Persons right to
indemnification pursuant to, but subject to the limitations of, this _Article
VIII_ , shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person (including by any of its
Affiliates or Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates or Representatives knew or should have known
that any representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

\- 48 - Section 9.02 _Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which such
successors and permitted assigns will be deemed to be a party hereto for all
purposes hereof. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other parties (with the Sellers
Representative acting for all of the Sellers and the Company), and any
attempt to do so will be null and void _ab initio_. Except as expressly
provided herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto
and their successors and permitted assignees and nothing herein expressed or

is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that an Indemnified
Person that is not party hereto is intended to be an express third party
beneficiary of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce its rights
hereunder.

 

Section 9.03 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative (acting for the Sellers), or in the case of a waiver, by the
party (or in the case of any or all of the Sellers, by the
Sellers Representative) against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy
in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or
not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation

covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any

party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will

Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates
explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings,
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.
There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings,
other than those expressly provided for herein and therein.

 

Section 9.05 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be

original, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same
instrument. This Agreement will become effective when duly executed and

may be delivered by facsimile or electronic delivery ( _i.e_., by email of a
PDF signature page) and each such counterpart signature page will constitute

Section 9.06 _Provisions Concerning the Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoints TSG
Administration, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the sole and
exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes
of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions,
with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Sellers behalf ("
_Sellers  Representative_"). The appointment of Sellers

 



\- 49 -  Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable
and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy,
illness or other inability to act of any Seller. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative is hereby authorized,
on behalf of the Sellers, to:

 

(i) in connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents,
instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the
name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the
Contemplated Transactions;

 

(ii) receive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings,
enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute,
defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and
Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or
Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to
the matters set forth in _Section 2.06_, _Section 6.09_ or _Article VIII_
or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Contemplated Transactions;

 

(iii) execute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith
discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any
term or provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, or any
consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements; and

 

(iv) take all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf
of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and exercise
any and all rights that the Sellers or Sellers Representative are permitted
or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

 

Each of the Sellers acts through the Sellers Representative with respect to
the aforementioned matters and none of the Sellers has the right to
act independently with respect to any such matter or to institute or
participate in any suit, action or proceeding, now existing or hereafter
arising, against or by the Buyer or the Company with respect to this
Agreement, any such right being irrevocably and exclusively with the Sellers
Representative.

(b) _Liability_. Sellers Representative shall not be held liable by any of
the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all
or any of the power and authority of Sellers Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, except in the case of Sellers Representatives gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct. Sellers Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and
will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken
in good faith based on such advice. The Sellers will jointly and severally
indemnify Sellers Representative from any and all Losses as well as
any attorneys and experts fees and expenses incurred with respect to the
extent to which a Loss is indemnifiable hereunder arising out of its serving
as the Sellers Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or
caused by Sellers Representatives gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Sellers Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely
for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in
such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and Buyer
agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of Sellers
Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.

 



\- 50 - (c) _Reliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers  Representative_. The Buyer
may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers Representative
granted pursuant to this _Section 9.06_ without any further inquiry or action
until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers
Representative made in accordance with this _Section 9.06_. In so doing, the
Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of Sellers
Representative under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and direct
all communications through such Sellers Representative, notwithstanding any
dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or Sellers Representative
with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or
obligation to inquire of, any Seller, Sellers Representative or any other
Person. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers Representative
shall constitute a decision of all Sellers and shall be final and binding upon
each of the Sellers. At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by
a written instrument that is signed in writing by Sellers that previously held
the majority of the Class B common stock and Sellers that previously held the
majority of the Class A Common Stock and delivered to the Buyer, the Sellers
Representative may be removed and a successor appointed with respect to such
Company. If Sellers Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise
cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no
successor is appointed by such holders within ten (10) Business Days, then the
Buyer shall have the right to petition a court at the Sellers sole cost and
expense to appoint a replacement Sellers Representative who shall serve as
described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such
replacement Sellers Representative.

 

(d) _Sellers  Representative Expense Amount_. The Sellers Representative
Expense Amount will be used to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred by or
for the benefit of the Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) on or after
the Closing Date and shall be paid or distributed at the direction of the
Sellers Representative. In the event that any amount is owed by the Sellers
Representative, whether for fees, expense reimbursement or otherwise, that is
in excess of the Sellers Representative Expense Amount (or after the any or
all of the Sellers Representative Expense Amount has been dispersed to the
Sellers), the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to be reimbursed by
the Sellers for the shortfall. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Buyer is delivering the Sellers Representative Expense Amount to
the Sellers Representative on behalf of and at the direction of the Sellers.
In no event shall the Buyer or any Company Entity have any Liability to the
Sellers, any holder of Options or the Sellers Representatives in respect of
the Sellers Representative Expense Amount or the Sellers Representatives
holding or disbursement hereof. In no event shall the Buyer or any Company
Entity have any Liability to the Sellers, any holder of Options or the
Sellers Representatives in respect of (i) the Sellers Representatives
holding or disbursement of (a) any portion of the Aggregate Consideration paid
to the Sellers Representative, whether on behalf of any Seller or any holder
of Options or otherwise, or (b) any portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, the Tax Escrow Amount or the Price Adjustment Escrow Amount paid to
the Sellers Representative, whether on behalf of any Seller or otherwise, and
(ii) the determination by the Sellers Representative of any amounts owing or
payable to the holders of Options. Each Seller acknowledges that the Sellers
Representative shall disburse amounts released to the Sellers Representative
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with this Agreement and, to
the extent applicable, to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata
Portions.

 



\- 51 - Section 9.07 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision
hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable
in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be
construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to
the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal
Requirements.

Section 9.08  _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the parties
hereunder and all Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection
herewith, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.09 _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_.

 

(a) _Jurisdiction_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 2.06_ (which will
govern any dispute arising thereunder), each of the parties to this
Agreement, by its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the
State of Delaware and the state courts of the State of Delaware for the
purpose of any Action among any of the parties, including without limitation
any such Action relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, (ii) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Legal Requirements, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action brought in one of
the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum non
conveniens_ , should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other Action in any other court other than one of the above-named courts or
that this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the subject matter hereof
or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees
not to commence any such Action other than before one of the above-named
courts. Notwithstanding the previous sentence a party may commence any Action
in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of
enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

(b) _Venue_. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that for any Action
among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or
in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, such party shall bring such Action only in the State of
Delaware. Notwithstanding the previous sentence a party may commence any
Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of
enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts. Each
party hereto further waives any claim and will not assert that venue should
properly lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction.

 



\- 52 - (c) _Service of Process_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby (i)
consents to service of process in any Action among any of the parties hereto
relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions in any
manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii) agrees that service of process made in
accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section 9.01_, will
constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action and (iii)
waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise)
in any such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with
clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

Section 9.10 _Certain Matters of Construction_.

 

(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

or referred to in this Agreement. 

 



\- 53 - Section 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT
THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF
THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS WILL
INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING
WITHOUT A JURY.

 

Section 9.12 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) Each of the parties agrees that irreparable harm for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that it does not fully and timely perform its obligations under or
in connection with this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement and the Closing)
in accordance with its terms. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of
damages and without posting a bond, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which such other parties are entitled under this Agreement and (ii) the
right to obtain an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief is an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and without that
right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at Law.

Section 9.13 _Limitation on Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no claim arising in whole or in part out of
or related to this Agreement, the negotiation, interpretation, construction,
validity or enforcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or otherwise)
shall be brought or maintained by or on behalf of any party hereto or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or their respective successors
or permitted assigns against any Person not a party hereto.
