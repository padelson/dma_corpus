2 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of June 15, 2005,
among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Viper Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_
"), and Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").



THE PARTIES ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, on the basis of the following facts,
intentions and understandings.



A. The Board of Directors of each of the Company, Sub and Parent has approved
and declared advisable the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.



B. Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1.



The Merger



SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3 of this Agreement).
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL. As a result of
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Parent.



SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second Business Day (as defined below) after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable
Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI of this Agreement (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and applicable Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
OMelveny and Myers LLP, 275 Battery Street, San Francisco, California 94111,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company; provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article
VI of this Agreement shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted
by this Agreement and applicable Law) waived on such second Business Day, then
the Closing shall take place on the first Business Day on which all such
conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and applicable Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or a day on which banks in New York City are authorized or
obligated by Law or executive order to close.

 



 

3 SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as promptly as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL or applicable Italian Law. The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date and time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the date and time that the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").



SECTION 1.4  _Effects of The Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.



SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation And Bylaws_.



(a) The certificate of incorporation of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.



(b) The bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.



SECTION 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.



SECTION 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.



ARTICLE 2.



Effect of the Merger on the Capital; Exchange of Certificates



SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:



(a) _Common Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted into and become one
validly issued,



 

4 fully paid and non-assessable share of identical common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of the
Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company Common Stock_
") that is directly owned by the Company, Parent, Sub, or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock,
including the associated right (the " _Rights_ ") to purchase one-hundredth of
a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001
per share (" _Series A Preferred Stock_ "), of the Company or in certain
circumstances Company Common Stock pursuant to the Shareholders Rights
Agreement dated as of June 28, 2001, as amended, by and between the Company
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the " _Rights
Agreement_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) of this
Agreement and the Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d) of this
Agreement) shall be converted into the right to receive $29.10 in cash (as
such amount may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(h)), without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock (and the associated Rights) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
any such share of Company Common Stock (and the associated Rights) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. The right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding and/or deduction that is required under applicable Tax Law in
accordance with Section 2.2(i) of this Agreement. The Merger Consideration
shall be paid in the manner set forth in Section 2.2. 



(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock (and the
associated Rights) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement, but instead such holder shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(c) of this Agreement. The



 

5 Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.



(e) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under any
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company,
including the 1995 Stock Option Plan, the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2001
Stock Option Plan, the 2002 Stock Option Plan and the 2003 New-Hire Stock
Option Plan (collectively, the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "), whether or not
exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any Company Option be cancelled and the holder
thereof will receive within 10 Business Days of the Effective Time a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company
Option, and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). All amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) of this Agreement shall be subject to
and reduced by the amount of any withholding and/or deduction that is
required under applicable Tax Law in accordance with Section 2.3 of this
Agreement. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts such that, upon the Effective Time, each Company Option
is treated in accordance with this Section 2.1(e) of this Agreement.



(f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take any and all actions
with respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as
are necessary to provide that the ESPP shall terminate, effective as of the
Effective Time, and each Option (as defined in the ESPP) outstanding for the
Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) under the ESPP that terminates at the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and each participant in the ESPP for that
Offering Period shall be entitled to receive, within 10 Business Days of the
Effective Time, in lieu of any other amounts otherwise payable to such
participant under the ESPP with respect to such Option, an amount in cash
equal to (a) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (b) the number of whole
and fractional shares of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable
upon exercise of such Option had it been exercised at the Effective Time and
the participant purchased the maximum number of shares subject thereto using
the full amount of his or her Contributions (as defined in the ESPP) to the
ESPP for that Offering Period. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section
2.1(f) of this Agreement shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law, in accordance with
Section 2.2(i) of this Agreement.



(g) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Company Common
Stock or capital stock convertible into Company Common Stock (the "
_Warrants_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled in exchange for a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant and
(B) the Merger Consideration, minus (ii) the per share exercise price of such
Warrant (provided that if such calculation results in a negative number, the



 

6 lump sum cash payment shall be deemed to be $0) (the " _Warrant Cash Payment_
"). Such payment shall be made within ten Business Days of the Effective
Time. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(g) of this Agreement
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding and/or
deduction that is required under applicable Tax Law in accordance with
Section 2.2(i) of this Agreement.



SECTION 2.2  _Exchange of Shares_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this
Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a share of Company Common Stock (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify when delivery of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be effected, and, with respect to certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Certificates_ "), that the risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which
letter of transmittal shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates or the surrender of common stock held
in book-entry form (including through book-entry positions with depository
intermediaries participating in Monte Titoli S.p.A.) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a share of Company Common Stock
shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or compliance with
the instructions for book-entry tender of such share, together with
submission of a letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (and the associated Rights) previously represented by such
Certificate or held in book-entry form shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock (and the associated Rights)
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of
the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.



 

7 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (and the
associated Rights). At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock (and the associated Rights) that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled
against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article
II.



(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.



(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public

the provisions hereof will constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation
of, or a default under the Organizational Documents of Parent, Sub or of any
of Parents Subsidiaries, or (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under,
the acceleration of any obligations, the loss of any right or benefit or the

assets of Parent, Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries (with or without notice,

permit or license to which Parent, Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for such breaches,
violations, defaults, accelerations, creations or changes that would not,

by or on behalf of Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to

business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated
hereby.



(g) _Consents and Approvals_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or Sub nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in a violation of Law
by Parent or Sub. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or

14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of

including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the stockholders of the
Company or (ii) taking actions permitted by Section 4.1(d) of this Agreement.



(f) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event

security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.2 and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity.

the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,

SECTION 5.4 _Employee Matters_.



(a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (subject to
this Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 of this Agreement), or, as applicable,
will cause its Subsidiaries to, honor all obligations under any contracts,
agreements, collective bargaining agreements, plans (as such may be amended in
accordance with this Agreement) and commitments of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that exist on the date of this Agreement (or as established or
amended in accordance with or as permitted by this Agreement) that apply to
any current or former employee, or current or former director, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that this undertaking is not
intended to prevent the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from
amending, modifying, suspending, revoking or terminating any such contract,
agreement, collective bargaining agreement or commitment. The
Surviving Corporation acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries
that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
constitute a "Change of Control" or a "Change in Control," as applicable under
the Employee Benefit Plans. Until the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (exclusive of any employees who
are subject to a collective bargaining agreement) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits from
time to time that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



(b) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company Employees
(other than Company Employees who are party to individual agreements providing
for severance benefits) shall be eligible to receive severance benefits in
amounts and on terms and conditions no less favorable than those provided to
Company Employees pursuant to policies (severance benefit provisions contained
in individual agreements with Company Employees shall not be used for purposes
of determining comparability of severance policies) in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time.



(c) Subject to its obligations under applicable Law and applicable collective
bargaining agreements, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as well as
each of their



 

32 respective Subsidiaries, shall give credit under each of their respective
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which Company Employees
participate to Company Employees for all service prior to the Effective Time
with the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, or
any predecessor employer (to the extent that such credit was given under
similar plans, programs and arrangements by the Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable) for all purposes for which such
service was taken into account or recognized by the Company or Parent
or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, but not (i) to the extent
crediting such service would result in duplication of benefits, or (ii) for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan.



SECTION 5.5 _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation
and Insurance_.



(a) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers, employees or fiduciaries under benefit
plans currently indemnified of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as provided
in the Organizational Documents or other indemnification agreements in effect
as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. In addition, from and after
the Effective Time, directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries under
benefit plans currently indemnified of the Company or its Subsidiaries who
become directors, officers, employees or fiduciaries under benefit plans of
the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to the indemnity rights and
protections afforded to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries under
benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance policies currently maintained by the Company covering
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance policies on terms with respect
to such coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those set forth in the
relevant policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend annually in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage (and to the extent the annual premium would
exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 250%
of such annual premium) . In addition, the Company may satisfy its obligations
under this Section 5.5(b) by purchasing a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, or any
other person entitled to the benefit of Sections 5.5(a) and (b) of this
Agreement, as applicable, than the existing directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated hereby. If such "tail"
prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
the Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, to maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full
term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder. 



 

33 (c) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless each present director and officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, determined as of the date hereof, and any person who becomes
such a director or officer between the date hereof and the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Person_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law (and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, provided that if required by applicable
Law the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification); and provided, further, that any determination as to
whether an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses hereunder pursuant to applicable Law shall be made by independent
counsel jointly selected by the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified
Person. Parent or the Surviving Corporation will have the right to assume and
control the defense of any action for which indemnification is sought
hereunder or under the Companys Organizational Documents or indemnification
agreements. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay for
only one firm or counsel for all indemnified parties in any jurisdiction,
except to the extent there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of such
indemnified party and any other indemnified party, in which case each
indemnified party with a conflicting position on a significant issue shall be
entitled to retain separate counsel mutually satisfactory to Parent and such
indemnified party. The indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).



(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.5 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Person, or any other person entitled to the
benefit of Sections 5.5(a) and (b) of this Agreement, as the case may be, to
whom this Section 5.5 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified
Person or such other person, as the case may be. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.



(e) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and each other person
entitled to the benefit of Sections 5.5(a) and (b) of this Agreement, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.



 

34 SECTION 5.6 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as provided in this Section 5.6, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.



(b) The Company shall pay Parent a fee of $58 million (the " _Termination Fee_
"), if this Agreement is terminated:



(i) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), 7.1(b)(iii) or 7.1(c), and prior to
such termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and,
except with respect to a Takeover Proposal that is consummated or with respect
to which an Acquisition Agreement is entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries during the nine-month period following such termination (a "
_Subsequent Takeover Proposal_ "), not withdrawn or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Takeover Proposal and, except with respect to a Subsequent Takeover Proposal,
not withdrawn such intention, and within nine months of such termination the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal (and the Takeover Proposal set forth in such
Acquisition Agreement is subsequently consummated, whether during or after
such nine-month period) or consummates a Takeover Proposal (for the purposes
of the foregoing (and Section 7.1(e)) the terms " _Acquisition Agreement_ "
and " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
Section 4.2 of this Agreement except that the references to "10%" in the
definition of " _Takeover Proposal_ " in Section 4.2(a) of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be references to "50%");



(ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(e); or



(iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(f).



(c) The Termination Fee shall be payable by wire transfer of same day funds
immediately upon termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f), within two Business
Days of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e), and upon consummation of a
Takeover Proposal after termination pursuant to the circumstances described
in Section 5.6(b)(i).



(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 5.5(b)
of this Agreement are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 5.5(b) of this Agreement, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fees set forth in Section 5.5(b) of this
Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.



 

35 SECTION 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent each shall consult
with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and prior to making any filings with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, except as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or national market system on which
such partys securities are listed or traded, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other to
the extent practicable. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.



SECTION 5.8  _Rights Agreement_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all further action reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the
Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 5.9 _Conduct of Parent_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, except as consented to in
writing by the Company, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall make
any acquisition that is reasonably likely to (i) materially impair Parents
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
cause a material delay of the Merger.



SECTION 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance
with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.



SECTION 5.11 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of, and furnish Parent with any information it may reasonably request
with respect to, (i) any representation or warranty becoming untrue such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) would not be satisfied, or (ii) the
failure by the Company to comply with any of its covenants such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied; provided,
however, that in no event will the failure of the Company to deliver notice to
Parent pursuant to clause (i) be considered a failure of the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(b) or a basis for termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c)
as it relates to a breach of covenants. The Companys satisfaction of its
obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement and no information delivered to Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall update the Disclosure Schedule.

Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date), except for any failure of such representations and warranties
to be true and correct that would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect (it being understood
that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties, all materiality and " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "
qualifications in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded).
The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by
an executive officer of Parent to such effect.



(b)  _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub_. Parent and Sub shall

or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 6.1,
6.2 or 6.3 of this Agreement, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or to use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to
Section 5.3 of this Agreement.



ARTICLE 7.

therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

Agreement and (B) is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by the
Company within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice of such

the effects referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.2(c) of this
Agreement shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;

Agreement and (B) is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by Parent
within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice of such breach or

(e) by the Parent if prior to obtaining Stockholder Approval (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) (i) shall have withdrawn

material modification to such Takeover Proposal occurring after the receipt
of Parents written request and provided, further, that such 10-Business Day
period shall recommence each time a Takeover Proposal has been made following
the receipt of Parents written request by a person that had not made
a Takeover Proposal prior to the receipt of Parents written request, (iii)
shall have approved or recommended, or proposed to approve or recommend, a
Takeover Proposal, (iv) the Company shall have entered into any letter of
intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or commitment accepting

Information; Confidentiality), Section 5.6 (Fees and Expenses), this Section
7.2 and Article VIII of this Agreement, which provisions shall survive such

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.



SECTION 7.5 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 of this Agreement or an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 of this Agreement shall, in order to be
effective, require, in the case of Parent or the Company, action by its Board
