expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th Business Day following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the SEC).
 Sub expressly reserves the right to modify the terms of the Offer, except

Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), and (ii) without the consent
of the Company (unless the Company takes any action permitted to be taken
pursuant to _Section 6.02(b_ )), Sub shall not (A) reduce the number of
Shares subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price, (C) modify or add to
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ , (D) except as provided

not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived;

the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any condition to
the Offer is not satisfied, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend
the Offer at the request of the Company for not less than twenty

     

   

(20) Business Days. In addition, Sub may and, if requested by the Company,
Sub shall, extend the Offer after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a

Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered

ARTICLE III

  

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or any
holder of Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share that
is held by the Company as treasury stock, or owned by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, Parent Sub, or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

(c) _Conversion of Shares and Options_.

  

(i) Subject to _Sections 3.01(b)_  and _3.01(d)_ , each issued and
outstanding Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

(ii) Subject to _Sections 3.01(b)_  and _3.01(d)_ , as of the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.02_ , without
interest.

  

(iii) Company Employee Stock Options shall be treated as set forth in
_Section 7.04_.

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ , but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_
, _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_. The Company
shall provide prompt notice

     

   

to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares,
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of any such demands and any other
documents received in connection with any assertion of rights to payment of
fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

Section 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank,
trust company or other paying agent to act as the Paying Agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates. The
Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, as
and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to satisfy the
amounts due under this Agreement in respect of the Shares converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates, other than holders of Certificates representing
Shares referred to in _Section 3.01(b)_ , (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration,
for each Share theretofore represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay to the Paying
Agent any Stock Transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or
(B) establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax has been paid or is otherwise not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each Certificate (other
than Certificates representing Appraisal Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.

  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.  The Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any
Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no

     

   

further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holder
of Shares who has not theretofore complied with this  _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Applicable Law) for payment of its claim for the
Merger Consideration.

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. If
any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date that is five (5)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such
shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

  

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
as determined in accordance with _Section 3.01_ , provided that the Person
to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a condition precedent to
the payment thereof, indemnify the Surviving Corporation and Parent in a
manner satisfactory to Parent (including the posting by such Person of such
bond and security as the Surviving Corporation and Parent may reasonably
request) against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation
and Parent with respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.

Section 4.04 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_.

  

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to be executed and
delivered by or on behalf of it pursuant to or in connection with or as
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and to consummate the
Transactions.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions (other than
the Company Stockholder Approval in the case of the Merger) have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
except for the Company Stockholder Approval in the case of the Merger (if
required), no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary
to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes (assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Sub, as applicable),
a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and subject to general principles of equity.

of this Agreement, unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving, adopting

Transactions, (ii) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that the holders of Shares accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and (iv) recommending
that the Companys stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement. Subject to
the truth, accuracy and completeness of Parents representation in _Section
5.07_ , the actions set forth in such resolutions are sufficient to render
inapplicable to Parent and Sub and this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions the restrictions
on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. The Company
has been advised by each of its directors and executive officers that each
such Person intends to tender all Shares owned by such Person pursuant to the
Offer, except to the extent of any restrictions created by Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act.

     

   

(c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the approval
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ ").  No vote or approval of any holder of Company Capital Stock is
necessary to approve any Transaction Agreement other than this Agreement or
to consummate the Offer or any Transaction other than the Merger.

  

Section 4.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.05(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or
impose any penalty or fine under, or result in the creation of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the
Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any Material
Contract, (iii) any other Contract to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective material
properties or assets is bound or (iv) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in _Section 4.05(b)_ , any provision of any Order or
Applicable Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ ,
_(iii)_ or _(iv)_  above, any such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act
and any applicable laws, regulations or statutes relating to the regulation
of monopolies or competition in any foreign jurisdiction (" _Foreign
Competition Laws_ "), (ii) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Schedule 14D-9,

Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the
other jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business, (iv)
such filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in
_Section 7.08_ , and (v) such other items as are set forth in
_Section 4.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.  For purposes of this
_Section 4.05(b)_ and any other relevant representations and warranties of
the Company, the representations and warranties are made based upon the
assumption that the Company shall be the Surviving Corporation.

regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC, and the statements contained
in all such certifications were as of the respective dates made, complete and
correct except for such failures to be complete and correct as have not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its officers has received notice from
the SEC or the Nasdaq National Market questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or submission of
such certifications. The Company is, and through the Closing Date will be,
otherwise in material compliance with all applicable effective provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules of the Nasdaq National Market.

operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

  

(d) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise, asserted or unasserted, due or to become due, known
or unknown, and whether or not required to be disclosed on a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities (i) stated or adequately
reserved against in the Financial Statements of the Company included in the

Disclosure Letter, or (ii) incurred in the ordinary and usual course of
business since December 31, 2005, that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

supplied in writing by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will not, at the
time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the
Companys stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, and (b) the Proxy Statement
will not, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent
or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

_Section 6.01(a)_ , other than actions in connection with entering into this

Section 6.02 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not (and the Company
shall not permit any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of its or their
officers or directors to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent any of the Companys or any Company Subsidiaries non-officer
employees, or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it or any Company Subsidiary from taking
any action to) directly or indirectly (i) solicit, knowingly encourage,
engage in discussions or negotiate with any Person that could submit a bona
fide offer (whether such discussions or negotiations are initiated by the
Company or otherwise) or take any other action intended or designed to
facilitate, any inquiry or effort of any Person that could submit a bona fide
offer (other than Parent or Sub) relating to any Alternative Acquisition,
(ii) provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other
than Parent, relating to a possible Alternative Acquisition by any Person,
other than Parent, (iii) enter into an agreement with any Person, other than
Parent, providing for a possible Alternative Acquisition or (iv) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
possible Alternative Acquisition by any Person, other than by Parent;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall prevent or
preclude the Company from issuing press releases, filing required documents
with the SEC or holding a quarterly earnings call, in each case in the
ordinary and usual course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to, and subject to the
conditions of, the Offer, (A) the Company has received an unsolicited written
proposal for an Alternative Acquisition (" _Alternative Acquisition Proposal_
") that did not result from a breach of the first sentence of this _Section
6.02(a)_ and (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with an independent financial advisor and independent counsel)
(1) that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal is or, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal (as defined in _Section 6.02(e)_ ) and (2) that
such actions are necessary in order to comply with the fiduciary obligations
of the Company Board under Delaware law, the Company may, subject to
providing prior written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action,
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to the Person making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal and its
representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms not
materially more favorable to the Person making the Alternative Acquisition
Proposal than those applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit
disclosure to Parent of the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal and any material changes thereto) and (y)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person and
its representatives. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause its representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that may have occurred prior to the date of this Agreement
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this _Section
6.02_ and _Section 9.02(b)(ii)_, the term "Person" shall include any "group"
as defined in 17 CFR 240.13d-5.

  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof authorized by the
Company Board in such regard shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or

     

   

any such committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (ii) approve
or cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, definitive agreement or similar agreement constituting or
relating to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (iv) agree or
resolve to take actions set forth in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_  or _(iii)_ of
this sentence.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the period prior to
the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company
Board receives a Superior Company Proposal that did not result from a breach
of the first sentence of _Section 6.02(a)_ and the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with independent counsel, that it is
necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations under
Delaware law, the Company Board may, during such period, in response to such
a Superior Company Proposal, withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and, in connection
therewith, approve or recommend such Superior Company Proposal at any time
after the third Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice
from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has received a
Superior Company Proposal and intends to withdraw or modify its
recommendation, identifying the Person making such Superior Company Proposal
and specifying the financial and other material terms and conditions of such
Superior Company Proposal (it being understood and agreed by the parties that
such withdrawal or modification of the Company Boards recommendation shall
not alter the Company Boards approval of this Agreement, the Tender
Agreement and the Transactions (including for purposes of Section 203 of the
DGCL)).

  

(c) The Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days,
shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could lead to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making any such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the material terms of any
such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status, including any change to the
details, of any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) with copies of all material

taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required

portion thereof without the prior written consent of Parent.

consent, and (e) not make any material Tax election, settle or compromise any
material Tax liability or refund or file any amended Tax Return without

set forth therein) to the extent arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of, any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys duties as an
officer, director or employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, including in respect to this Agreement, any other Transaction
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,

the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required
by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee in an amount equal to $10,000,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") if:

  

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ (but only
with respect to a breach of _Section 6.02_ ) or _Section 9.01(d)_ or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_ ; or

  

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, any Person shall have made, or
proposed, communicated or disclosed in a manner which is or otherwise becomes
public prior to or during the pendency of the Offer (which shall include
being known by stockholders of the Company) an intention to make an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal;

  

(B) this Agreement is terminated for any reason (other than termination
pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_ , _9.01(b)(ii)_ ,  _9.01(b)(iii)_ , _9.01(f)_
or _9.01(g)_ ); and

  

(C) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company enters into a
definitive agreement for an Alternative Acquisition, or the transactions

     



   

contemplated by an Alternative Acquisition Proposal are consummated, with
such Person; _provided_ , that solely for purposes of this _Section
9.02(b)(ii)(C)_ , the phrase "twenty percent (20%)" in _clauses (ii)_ and
_(iii)_ in the definition of "Alternative Acquisition" shall be deemed to be
replaced by the phrase "a simple majority".

  

(c) (i)  Any fee due under this _Section 9.02_ shall be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement
(except that, in the case of a payment pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)(ii)_ ,
such payment shall be made on the date of execution of such definitive
agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transaction) and (ii) upon
failure to pay any such fee on the date due pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this
_Section 9.02(c)_ , interest shall accrue on the amount of such fee from such
date to the date of actual payment at a variable rate equal to the prime rate
(as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ " _Money Rates_ ") plus three
percent (3%) per annum.

  

(d) All fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Company shall share equally the filing fees in connection
with the HSR Act and the filing fees in connection with the Offer Documents.

  

(e) The right to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_
and other amounts pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ shall be the exclusive
remedy for any breach by the Company of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or other provisions of this Agreement, except in the
case of fraud and except that if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)_ with respect to a breach of _Section 6.02_ Parent shall
have the option, exercisable by written notice to the Company at any time
within ten (10) Business Days after such termination, to elect not to accept
the Termination Fee, and, if already paid to Parent, refund the Termination
Fee to the Company, in which case Parent thereafter may pursue any remedy
available to it in law or equity without regard to any limitation contained
in this _Section 9.02(e)_.  Acceptance by Parent of the Termination Fee due
under this Section shall constitute final and definitive acceptance by Parent
of the validity of any termination of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

  

Section 9.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso
of _Section 9.03_ , waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any

     



   

party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

Section 9.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.03_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 9.04_ shall, in order to be effective, be in writing and require
in the case of Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors
or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors (subject, in the
case of the Company, to the requirements of _Section 2.03_ ).

to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Section 10.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The
Transaction Agreements, the Company Disclosure Letter and all exhibits and
schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, taken together, (a)
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
Transactions and (b) except for _Section 7.06_  and, from and after the
Effective Time, _Section 3.01(c)(i)_ , are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

     



   

Section 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

  

Section 10.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub
of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

Section 10.09 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of any Transaction Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any Transaction
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of each
Transaction Agreement in the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
United States located in Wilmington, Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition,

jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States
located in Wilmington, Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of any
Transaction Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for

relating to any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction in any court other

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

  

Conditions of the Offer

  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not
be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly
after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (i) there shall have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
(including any extensions thereof in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ of
this Agreement) (the " _Determination Time_ ") that number of Shares which
would represent, together with all Shares beneficially owned by Parent or
Sub, at least a majority in voting power of the Fully Diluted Shares (the "
_Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) the waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer under the
HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired and any consents,
approvals and filings under any Foreign Competition Laws, the absence of
which would prohibit the purchase of all Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, shall have been obtained or made prior to the expiration of the Offer.
The term " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " means all outstanding securities entitled
generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a fully
diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or termination
of all options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or convertible
into such voting securities. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of
the Offer or this Agreement, Sub shall not be required to accept for payment
or to pay for any Shares not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for,
and may terminate or amend the Offer, with the consent of the Company or if,
at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the acceptance
of such shares for payment or the payment therefor, any of the following
conditions exists:

  

(a) there shall have been instituted any Proceeding that is likely to
succeed, (i) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Sub of any Shares,
seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or
the Merger or any other Transaction, or seeking to obtain from the Company,
Parent or Sub any damages with respect to the Transaction that are material
in relation to the Company and its Subsidiary taken as a whole, (ii) (A)
seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any material portion of the business or assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or to compel the
Company, or any Company Subsidiary to dispose of or hold separate any
material portion of the business or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other Transactions, or (B) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership
or operation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of a portion of the
business or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which business
or assets are material relative to the size of the Transactions, or to
compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any
portion of the business or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which
business or assets are material relative to the size of the Transactions, as
a result of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (iii)
seeking to impose limitations on the ability of Parent or Sub to acquire or
hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any Shares, including the
right to vote the Company Common Stock purchased by it on all matters
properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, (iv) seeking to
prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in
any material respect the business

     

   

or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or (v) which
otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

(b) any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, interpretation, judgment,
Order or injunction shall be enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, amended
or issued with respect to, or deemed applicable to, or any consent or
approval withheld with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, by any Governmental Entity that is reasonably likely to result,
directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in paragraph
(a) above;

  

(c) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any event,
change, effect or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

(d) the Company Board or any committee thereof authorized by the Company
Board in such regard shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent or Sub its approval or recommendation of the Offer and this Agreement
or the Company Board or any committee thereof authorized by the Company Board
in such regard shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing actions;

  

(e) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement
shall contain inaccuracies or breaches of such representations and warranties
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, either as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Determination Time as though made at the
Determination Time; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining whether
such inaccuracies or breaches have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the existence of all materiality and
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth in the text of such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded, or (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company in _Sections 4.01_ , _4.03_ ,
_4.04_ , _4.05(a)(i)_ or _4.22_ shall contain inaccuracies or breaches that
result in such representations and warranties, individually or in the
aggregate, not being true and correct in all material respects, either as of
the date of this Agreement or as of such time as though made at such time;

  

(f) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
material obligation or to comply in any material respect with any material
agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement;

  

(g) Michael W. Ferro, Jr. shall not be an active employee of the Company;

  

(h) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;
or

  

(i) the Tender Agreement shall not be in full force and effect or the
Principal Company Stockholder shall have failed to perform in any material
respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any
agreement or covenant to be performed or complied with by it under the Tender
Agreement;

  

which, in the reasonable judgment of Sub or Parent, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including
any action or inaction by Parent or

     

   

any of its Affiliates), makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance
for payment or payment.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Sub and Parent and may
be asserted by Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
such condition or may be waived by Sub and Parent in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time in their sole discretion, except that the Minimum
Tender Condition may not be waived. The failure by Parent, Sub or any other
Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall
be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.
