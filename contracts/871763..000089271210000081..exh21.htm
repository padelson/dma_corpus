THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 1, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), by and among Manpower Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Taurus Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and COMSYS IT Partners, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

Recitals:

 

WHEREAS, the Companys Board of Directors (the " _Company Board_ "), Parents
Board of Directors (the " _Parent Board_ ") and Merger Subs Board of
Directors have approved, and have deemed it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders or shareholders, as the case may
be, that Merger Sub make an exchange offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in _Section
3.5(a)_ ) for the consideration set forth herein and have approved, and have
deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
or shareholders, as the case may be, to consummate, the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

WHEREAS, if Merger Sub does not make the election referred to in _Section
1.1(g)_ (such election being referred to in this Agreement as the " _All-Cash
Election_ "), then each share of Company Common Stock accepted by Merger Sub
in accordance with the terms of the Offer will be exchanged for the following
consideration from Merger Sub, at the election of the holder thereof and
subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section 1.1(d)_ through _Section
1.1(f)_ : (i) for a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a
Cash Election (as defined in _Section 1.1(c)_ ) has been made, the Cash
Consideration (as defined in _Section 1.1(a)_ ); and (ii) for a share of
Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election (as defined in
_Section 1.1(c)_ ) has been made, the Stock Consideration (as defined in
_Section 1.1(a)_ ), all subject to and in accordance with the provisions set
forth herein. If Merger Sub makes the All-Cash Election, then the Offer will
become a cash tender offer and Merger Sub will pay the Cash Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
all subject to and in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company has agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, that following the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock
in the Offer, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company with
the Company as the surviving corporation, as described in _Article 2_ of this
Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") and each share of Company Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
_Section 2.2(b)_ ) (other than each such share that is owned by Parent or any
of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
each such share that is held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the
Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
following consideration from Merger Sub, at the election of the holder thereof
and subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section 2.6(d)_ through _Section
2.6(h)_ : (i) for a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a
Merger Cash Election (as defined in _Section 2.6(c)_ ) has been made, the Cash
Consideration; and (ii) for a share of Company Common Stock with respect to
which a Merger Stock Election (as defined in _Section 2.6(c)_ ) has been made,
the Stock Consideration, all subject to and in accordance with the provisions
set forth

 


  

 



 



 



 



 

herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Merger Sub makes the All-Cash
Election, then each such share will be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration.

 



 

WHEREAS, if Merger Sub does not make the All-Cash Election and except as
provided in _Section 2.6(h)_ , then, as soon as practicable following the
Merger, Parent shall cause the Company to be merged with and into Parent or a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with
the Merger, the " _Mergers_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, if Merger Sub does not make the All-Cash Election and except as
provided in _Section 2.6(h)_ , it is intended that, for United States federal
income tax purposes, (i) the Offer and the Mergers (together, the "
_Transaction_ ") shall be treated as an integrated transaction and shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and (ii) this
Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of the
regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

WHEREAS, subsequent to the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board and
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and an
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with each
stockholder listed on _Schedule I_ to such Tender and Voting Agreement
pursuant to which each such stockholder has agreed to tender all of the shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholder in the Offer
and to vote any shares of Company Common Stock acquired after the Final
Expiration Date (as defined in _Section 1.1(b)_ ) and not tendered in the
Offer in favor of the Merger (the " _Tender and Voting Agreement_ ").

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Section 8.3_ or
are elsewhere defined herein and referred to in _Section 8.4_.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

Article 1. 
  _The Offer_

 

 _Section 1.1_

 

 _The Offer_. 

 

(a)

 

Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
_Section 7.1_ , Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the later of (x) the filing
by Parent with the SEC of Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2009
fiscal year, or (y) the filing by the Company with the SEC of the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2009 fiscal year), commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer. Each
share of Company Common Stock accepted by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer
shall be exchanged for the right to

 

 

2

 



 



 



 

receive from Merger Sub, as the holder may elect: (i) such number of shares
or a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) $17.65 by (B) the Average Trading Price (such quotient,
rounded to the nearest thousandth, being the " _Stock Consideration_ "); or
(ii) $17.65 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), subject
to _Section 1.1(c)_ through _Section 1.1(f)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , if
Merger Sub has made the All-Cash Election, each share of Company Common Stock
accepted by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right
to receive from Merger Sub the Cash Consideration. The initial expiration
date of the Offer shall be the twentieth Business Day (calculated as set forth
in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) following commencement
of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "). The date on which Merger
Sub commences the Offer is referred to as the " _Offer Commencement Date_ ".

 

(b)

 

The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly
tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with the requirements
of this _Section 1.1(b)_ ) (the last of such dates being referred to herein as
the " _Final Expiration Date_ ") and not withdrawn a number of shares of
Company Common Stock which, together with the shares of Company Common Stock
then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority
of the sum of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Final Expiration Date and (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise or
conversion of all options, warrants, rights and convertible securities
outstanding immediately prior to the Final Expiration Date (the " _Minimum
Condition_ " and such sum being the total shares of Company Common Stock on a
" _Fully Diluted Basis_ ") and to the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_
hereto (together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserve the right to waive the Offer Conditions and to make any
change in the terms or conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Company, no change may be made which
(A) decreases the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the
Offer, (B) changes the form or amount of consideration to be paid (provided
that the making of the All-Cash Election by the Merger Sub shall not be deemed
to be such a change), (C) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the
Offer Conditions, (D) changes or waives the Minimum Condition or any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (2), (3), or (4) of _Annex I_, (E) extends
the expiration of the Offer (except as set forth in the following sentence),
or (F) makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions to the Offer
which is adverse in any material respect to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted by this Agreement) of the
Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for
payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the applicable expiration
date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with the requirements
of this _Section 1.1(b)_ ) (the date on which shares of Company Common Stock
are first accepted for payment under the Offer, the " _Acceptance Date_ ") and
shall pay for all such shares of Company Common Stock promptly after
acceptance; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) Merger Sub may extend the Offer
for successive extension periods not in excess of ten (10) Business Days per
extension if, at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer or any extension
thereof, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived,
until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, (II) if requested
by the

 

 

3

 



 



 

Company on any one occasion prior to or at the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for a period of ten (10) Business
Days in the event that any of the Offer Conditions, other than the condition
in paragraph (b) in _Annex I_ in circumstances involving (1) a willful breach
of any of the Companys covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder or (2)
a breach that would not reasonably be expected to be cured by the scheduled
expiration date of the Offer as so extended pursuant to such request, shall
not have been satisfied or waived at the time of such request, (III) Merger
Sub may extend the Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, NASDAQ or the NYSE, (IV) if Merger Sub makes the
All-Cash Election, then Merger Sub may, in its discretion (and without the
consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer until the date
on which materials disclosing that Merger Sub has made the All-Cash Election
are disseminated to the Companys stockholders and for a period of ten (10)
Business Days after such date, and (V) Merger Sub may extend the Offer on one
occasion only for no more than ten (10) Business Days if all of the Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived, but less than 90% of the total
shares of Company Common Stock on a Fully Diluted Basis have been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn at the otherwise scheduled Final
Expiration Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such extension beyond the
Outside Date shall be made without the consent of the Company.

 

(c)

 

Subject to _Section 1.1(d)_ through _Section 1.1(f)_ , each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to elect to receive either (i) the
Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") in respect of all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such stockholder (each such share being a " _Cash
Election Share_ "), or (ii) Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") in
respect of all shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder (each
such share being a " _Stock Election Share_ "). With respect to each share of
Company Common Stock for which no Cash Election or Stock Election has been
made, the holder thereof shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election (each
such share being a " _No Election Share_ "). Any Cash Election or Stock
Election shall be made solely on a form furnished by Merger Sub for that
purpose (the " _Form of Election_ "), included as part of the letter of
election and transmittal included as part of the Offer Documents (the "
_Election and Transmittal Letter_ "), each in a form that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. Holders of record who hold shares of Company
Common Stock as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may
submit multiple Forms of Election on behalf of their respective beneficial
holders.

 

(d)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
_Section 1.1(e)_ and _Section 1.1(f)_ :

 

(i)

 

If the product of (x) the total number of Cash Election Shares and (y) the
Cash Consideration (such product being the " _Elected Cash Consideration_ ")
is greater than the product of fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub
pursuant to the Offer and the Cash Consideration (such product, subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 1.1(d)(iv)_ , being the " _Available Cash
Amount_ "), then:

 

(A)

 

each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 

 

4

 



 



 

(B)

 

each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive: (1) an
amount in cash equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Available
Cash Amount by (II) the total number of Cash Election Shares (such quotient
being the " _Adjusted Cash Consideration_ "); and (2) the number of shares or
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (I) the amount equal to (a) the Cash Consideration minus (b) the
Adjusted Cash Consideration by (II) the Average Trading Price.

 

(ii)

 

If the product of (x) the sum of the total number of Stock Election Shares and
the total number of No Election Shares and (y) the Stock Consideration (such
product being the " _Elected Stock Consideration_ ") is greater than the
product of fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer
and the Stock Consideration (such product, subject to adjustment as provided
in _Section 1.1(d)(iv)_ , being the " _Available Stock Amount_ "), then:

 

(A)

 

each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; and

 

(B)

 

each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive: (1) the number of shares or a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the
Available Stock Amount by (II) the sum of the total number of Stock Election
Shares and the total number of No Election Shares (such quotient being the "
_Adjusted Stock Consideration_ "); and (2) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (I) an amount equal to (a) the Stock Consideration minus (b) the
Adjusted Stock Consideration and (II) the Average Trading Price.

 

(iii)

 

If the Elected Cash Consideration equals the Available Cash Amount (and the
Available Stock Amount as initially calculated is not adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.1(d)(iv)_ ), then:

 

(A)

 

each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; and

 

(B)

 

each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

(iv)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
the Offer exceed the Stock Consideration Cap (as defined below in this
_Section 1.1(d)(iv)_ ); and accordingly, if the Stock Consideration Cap is
less than the Available Stock Amount as initially calculated pursuant to
_Section 1.1(d)(ii)_ , then (A) the " _Available Stock Amount_ " as so
calculated shall be adjusted and instead shall be equal to the product of (I)
19.9% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Acceptance Date and (II) the quotient obtained by dividing (1)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
accepted for payment by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, by (2) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Acceptance Date
(such product also being the " _Stock Consideration Cap_ "); and (B) the "
_Available Cash Amount_ " as initially calculated pursuant to _Section
1.1(d)(i)_ shall be adjusted and instead shall be equal to the amount

 

 

5

 



 



 

of (I) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and accepted for payment by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and (2)
$17.65 minus (II) the product of (1) the Available Stock Amount as calculated
pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (A) and (2) the Average Trading
Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
any of _Section 1.1(d)_ through _Section 1.1(f)_ , in no event shall the
consideration per share payable pursuant to the Offer, consisting of the sum
of (A) the product of that number of shares, or that fraction of a share, of
Parent Common Stock, if any, issuable as the Stock Consideration for such
share pursuant to the Offer multiplied by the Average Trading Price, plus (B)
the cash payable as the Cash Consideration for such share pursuant to the
Offer, if any, be other than $17.65.

 

(e)

 

No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection
with the exchange of Parent Common Stock for shares of Company Common Stock
upon consummation of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such stockholder) in the Offer shall
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of such fraction and the Average
Trading Price.

 

(f)

 

If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any share of
Company Common Stock is accepted for exchange or payment pursuant to the
Offer, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Stock
Consideration and/or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, and any other
calculation based on or relating to the Parent Common Stock or the Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares such that there shall be the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement if such event had not occurred.

 

(g)

 

Merger Sub may make the All-Cash Election at any time (whether before or after
commencement of the Offer), but in no event less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Final Expiration Date. To make the All-Cash Election, Merger Sub
shall cause to be issued a press release disclosing that Merger Sub is
changing the Offer from an exchange offer to a cash tender offer pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement. Merger Sub shall cause a copy of such press
release to be provided to the Company promptly after it is issued.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Merger Sub makes the All-Cash Election, then (i) all obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub with respect to the Registration Statement (as defined in _Section
1.1(h)_ ), with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus (as defined in _Section
1.1(h)_ ) and with respect to the Post-Effective Amendment (as defined in
_Section 5.4(a)_ ) shall terminate and cease to be of any force or effect, and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any liability with respect thereto,
(ii) all obligations of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to the issuance,
delivery and listing of shares of Parent Common Stock shall terminate and
shall cease to be of any force or effect, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any liability with respect thereto, and (iii) the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_ and, as to any Subsidiary other than
Merger Sub, _Section 4.6_ and the representations and

warranties set forth in _Section 4.15_ (as they relate to the Registration
Statement and the Post-Effective Amendment), shall cease to be of any force or
effect, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any liability with
respect thereto. The All-Cash Election, once made by Merger Sub, shall be
irrevocable, and thereafter Merger Sub will pay only the Cash Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for
payment in the Offer.

 

(h)

 

As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, unless the All-Cash Election
shall have been made, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (including any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement will
include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required under
Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary
Prospectus_ "). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the Offer.
As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub
shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (the " _Schedule TO_ ") which will contain or incorporate
by reference all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus and form of the related
Election and Transmittal Letter and summary advertisement, if any (together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the " _Offer
Documents_ "), and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and the Companys
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(h)_. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents each time
before any such document is filed with the SEC. Parent agrees to provide the
Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel receives from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO, the Registration Statement
or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on
that response, including by participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 

 _Section 1.2_

 

 _Company Action_. 

 

(a)

 

As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendments

 

 

7

 



 



 

or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which shall include the
written opinion of Robert W. Baird and Co., Incorporated (" _Baird_ ") referred
to in _Section 3.15(b)_ and, subject to _Section 5.6_ , shall include the
Recommendations. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent,
Parents Subsidiaries and Parents shareholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section 1.2(a)_. Subject to _Section 5.6_ , the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of the Recommendations in the Offer Documents and agrees that
none of the Recommendations shall be withdrawn, modified or changed in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, and no resolution by the Company
Board, or any committee of the Company Board, to withdraw, modify or change
any of the Recommendations in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub shall
be adopted or proposed (it being understood that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a Recommendation shall be deemed to be withdrawn, modified or
changed in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub if such Recommendation
ceases to be unanimous; _provided_ , _however_ , that the abstention or
failure to participate in a Recommendation of a single director who is not
affiliated with or employed by a Company stockholder that is an entity and
that is a party to the Tender and Voting Agreement, in and of itself, shall
not cause a Recommendation to cease to be unanimous). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company Board may withhold,
withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, its
Recommendations solely in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.6_. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time
before it is filed with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that the Company or its counsel receives from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response,
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC.

 

(b)

 

The Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common
Stock held in stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent
practicable date, and will provide to Parent and Merger Sub such additional
information (including, without limitation, updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as
Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the Offer.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to
the Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

 _Section 1.3_

 

 _Directors_. 

 

(a)

 

Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), subject to
_Section 1.3(b)_ , Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this
_Section 1.3_ ) and (ii) the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including shares of Company Common
Stock accepted for payment) bears to the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall take all action reasonably
necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including, without limitation, at the option of Parent,
increasing the number of directors, or seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors, or both; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two members who
were directors of the Company prior to consummation of the Offer (each, a "
_Continuing Director_ "). If the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to
fewer than two for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and
departing Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate a person to fill
the vacancy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Parents designees are elected to the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be
required for the Company to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or
consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (ii) waive any of
the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (iii) extend the time
for performance of Parents and Merger Subs respective obligations hereunder,
or (iv) approve any other action by the Company which is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the interests of the Company Stockholders (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to its Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as
is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l. Parent will supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under this _Section
1.3(b)_ shall be subject to the receipt of such information.

 

 _Section 1.4_

 

 _Top-Up Option_. 

 

(a)

 

Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_ and _Section 1.4(c)_ , the Company grants to
Parent and Merger Sub an assignable and irrevocable option for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions herein (the "
_Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly issued
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-
Up Option, constitutes one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number
of shares of

 

 

9

 



 



 

Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance
of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option or (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized
to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued)
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (such shares to be issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ ").

 

(b)

 

The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after the Appointment Time, provided that the number
of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option constitutes at
least seventy percent (70%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding and that Merger Sub shall own, immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto, more than ninety
percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable to the
extent (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares would require approval of the
Companys stockholders under Rule 5635 of the NASDAQ listing standards and a
waiver of or exemption from such requirement is not obtained from NASDAQ or
(ii) any other provision of applicable Law or judgment, injunction, order or
decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the
Top-Up Shares. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.4(c)_ , the
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares shall be payable in
cash (whether or not the All-Cash Election shall have been made). Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 1.4(c)_ , the aggregate amount of cash payable
to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be equal to the product of the
number of Top-Up Shares and the Cash Consideration.

 

(c)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 1.4(b)_ , in
lieu of paying cash to the Company as consideration for the Top-Up Shares,
Parent or Merger Sub may execute and deliver to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the product of (i) the Top-Up Shares and
(ii) the Cash Consideration. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at
the rate per annum equal to the prime rate as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , Midwest Edition, on the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without
premium or penalty.

 

(d)

 

In the event that Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or Merger Sub intends
to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable exercise price, (iii) the place and
time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common
Stock by Parent or Merger Sub is to take place and (iv) an undertaking signed
by Parent and Merger Sub that, as promptly as practicable following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends to (and Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as practicable after such
exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated by _Section 5.4(c)_. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and the
Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub a certificate
representing such shares.

 

 

10

 



 



 



 

(e)

 

Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered
under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option is
being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by
applicable securities Laws.

 

(f)

 

Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with each other in doing, all things necessary
or desirable to procure from NASDAQ or any other Governmental Entity any
necessary waiver or other exemption from NASDAQ requirements or applicable Law
in order to issue the Top-Up Shares without obtaining the approval of the
Companys stockholders.

 

 _Section 1.5_

 

 _Tender of Company Restricted Shares_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall permit each Accelerated Award (as defined in Annex II hereto) to be
tendered in the Offer in accordance with Section 4(b)(ii) of Annex II.

 

Article 2. 
  _The Merger_

 

 _Section 2.1_

 

 _The Merger_. Upon the terms (including, without limitation, Section 5.4)
and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub, at the Effective Time,

Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

 

 _Section 2.2_

(a)

 

Unless the transactions herein contemplated have been abandoned and this
Agreement terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the offices of
Godfrey and Kahn, S.C. at 9:00 a.m., local time, as soon as possible but in no
event later than on the second Business Day after the first day on which all
of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that, by the express terms thereof, are
not capable of being satisfied until the Effective Time, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) (in any event, the " _Closing
Date_ "), unless otherwise provided by the mutual agreement, in writing, of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. Scheduling or commencing the Closing
shall not constitute a waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ by
any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.

 

(b)

 

At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, if applicable,
make all other filings or records required by the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the

 

 

11

 



 



 

" _Effective Time_ ") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such time as may be specified in the
certificate of merger.

 

 _Section 2.3_

 

 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 _Section 2.4_

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time,
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 _Section 2.6_

 

 _Conversion of Securities_. 

 

(a)

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Merger Sub, the Company or the record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ "):

 

(i)

 

Subject to _Section 2.6(c)_ through _Section 2.6(h)_ , each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ ), shall be converted into the right to receive either
(A) the Cash Consideration if in respect thereof the holder thereof validly
made and has not revoked a Merger Cash Election (as defined in _Section
2.6(c)_ ), or (B) the Stock Consideration if in respect thereof the holder
thereof validly made and has not revoked a Merger Stock Election (as defined
in _Section 2.6(c)_ ) or such share is a Merger No Election Share (as defined
in _Section 2.6(c)_ ). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration without interest, upon
surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.7_. The term " _Merger Consideration_ " means, for each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held of record by a Company Stockholder, either (A) the Cash
Consideration, (B) the Stock Consideration, or (C) such combination thereof as
results from the operation of _Section 2.6(c)_ through _Section 2.6(h)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Merger Sub has made the All-Cash Election,
the " _Merger Consideration_ " instead means, for each such share, the Cash
Consideration.

 


  

 

12

 



 



 

(ii)

 

Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or by any wholly owned Company
Subsidiary or, in the treasury of the Company, immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(iii)

 

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b)

 

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of restricted Company
Common Stock (" _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is then unvested shall be
canceled and terminated in exchange for a Replacement Award (as defined in
_Annex II_) in accordance with _Section 4(b)(i)_ of _Annex II_ , and shall
not be deemed issued and outstanding for purposes of the conversion of Company
Common Stock at the Effective Time.

 

(c)

 

Subject to _Section 2.6(d)_ through _Section 2.6(h)_ , each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ shall be entitled to elect to receive either
(i) the Cash Consideration (a " _Merger Cash Election_ ") in respect of all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by such stockholder (each such share being a " _Merger
Cash Election Share_ "), or (ii) the Stock Consideration (a " _Merger Stock
Election_ ") in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by such
stockholder (each such share being a " _Stock Election Share_ "). With
respect to each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time for which no Merger Cash Election or
Merger Stock Election has been made, the holder thereof shall be deemed to
have made a Merger Stock Election, as provided in _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ (each
such share being a " _Merger No Election Share_ "). Any Merger Cash Election
or Merger Stock Election shall be made solely on a form furnished by Parent
and the Surviving Corporation for that purpose (the " _Merger Form of
Election_ "), included as part of the letter of election and transmittal
described in _Section 2.7(c)_ , each in a form that is reasonably satisfactory
to the Company, and by the date specified in such letter of election and
transmittal as the " _Election Date_ ". Holders of record who hold shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit
multiple Merger Forms of Election on behalf of their respective beneficial
holders.

 

(d)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
_Section 2.6(e)_ through _Section 2.6(h)_ :

 

(i)

 

If the product of the total number of Merger Cash Election Shares and the Cash
Consideration (such product being the " _Merger Elected Cash Consideration_ ")
is greater than the product of fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ ) and the Cash

 

 

13

 



 



 

Consideration (such product, subject to adjustment as provided in _Section
2.6(d)(iv)_ , being the " _Merger Available Cash Amount_ "), then:

 

(A)

 

each Merger Stock Election Share and each Merger No Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 

(B)

 

each Merger Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive:
(1) an amount in cash equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the
Merger Available Cash Amount by (II) the total number of Merger Cash Election
Shares (such quotient being the " _Merger Adjusted Cash Consideration_ "); and
(2) the number of shares or a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the amount equal to (a) the Cash
Consideration minus (b) the Merger Adjusted Cash Consideration by (II) the
Average Trading Price.

 

(ii)

 

If the product of (1) the sum of the aggregate number of Merger Stock Election
Shares and the total number of Merger No Election Shares and (2) the Stock
Consideration (such product being the " _Merger Elected Stock Consideration_
") is greater than the product of fifty percent (50%) of the number of all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ ) and the Stock Consideration (such product,
subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 2.6(d)(iv)_ , being the "
_Merger Available Stock Amount_ "), then:

 

(A)

 

each Merger Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration; and

 

(B)

 

each Merger Stock Election Share and each Merger No Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive: (1) a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Merger
Available Stock Amount by (II) the sum of the total number of Merger Stock
Election Shares and the total number of Merger No Election Shares (such
quotient being the " _Merger Adjusted Stock Consideration_ "); and (2) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (I) an amount equal to the (a) the
Stock Consideration minus (b) the Merger Adjusted Stock Consideration and (II)
the Average Trading Price.

 

(iii)

 

If the Merger Elected Cash Consideration equals the Merger Available Cash
Amount (and the Merger Available Stock Amount as initially calculated is not
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)(iv)_ ), then:

 

(A)

 

each Merger Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration; and

 

(B)

 

each Merger Stock Election Share and each Merger No Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

(iv)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the total the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to
the Offer and issuable pursuant to the Merger and upon exercise or conversion
of all convertible

 

 

14

 



 



 

securities assumed by Parent in the Merger exceed 19.9% of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance
Date; and, accordingly, if the Merger Stock Consideration Cap (as defined
below in this _Section 2.6(d)(iv)_ ) is less than the Merger Available Stock
Amount as initially calculated pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)(ii)_ , then (A) the
" _Merger Available Stock Amount_ " as so calculated shall be adjusted and
instead shall be the amount equal to (I) 19.9% of the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Date minus
(II) the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Offer (such product also being the " _Merger Stock Consideration Cap_ "); and
(B) the " _Merger Available Cash Amount_ " as initially calculated pursuant to
_Section 2.6(d)(i)_ shall be adjusted and instead shall be equal to the amount
of (I) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(ii)_ ) and
(2) $17.65 minus (II) the product of (1) the Merger Available Stock Amount as
calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (A) and (2) the
Average Trading Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, including any of _Section 2.6(d)_ through _Section 2.6(h)_ , in no
event shall the Merger Consideration per share, consisting of the sum of (A)
the product of that number of shares, or that fraction of a share, of Parent
Common Stock, if any, issuable as the Merger Consideration for such share
multiplied by the Average Trading Price, plus (B) the cash payable as the
Merger Consideration for such share, if any, be other than $17.65.

 

(v)

 

Any Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.6(g)_ ) as to which the holder
fails to perfect or later waives, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL before the Election Date, shall be deemed
surrendered subject to a Merger Stock Election under _Section 2.6(d)(i)_ ,
_Section 2.6(d)(ii)_ , or _Section 2.6(d)(iii)_ , as the case may be, to the
extent of the Merger Stock Available Amount remaining after taking into
account the Merger Stock Elections made or deemed to have been made in
connection with the Merger by those former Company Stockholders who do not
hold Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , if such treatment of such
surrendered Dissenting Shares would cause the Merger Elected Stock
Consideration to exceed the Merger Stock Available Amount, then (A) such
surrendered Dissenting Shares causing such excess shall be deemed surrendered
subject to a Merger Cash Election for purposes of whichever of such section(s)
applies, and (B) the aggregate Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration to
be paid based on such deemed Merger Elections will be allocated on a pro rata
basis among all such surrendered Dissenting Shares such that each such
Dissenting Share is exchanged for the same proportion of Cash Consideration
and Stock Consideration, based on the respective percentages of aggregate Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration to be paid based on such deemed Merger
Elections.

 

(vi)

 

Any Dissenting Shares as to which the holder fails to perfect or later waives,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL after the
Election Date shall be deemed surrendered subject to a Merger Stock Election
under _Section 2.6(d)(i)_ , _Section 2.6(d)(ii)_ , or _Section 2.6(d)(iii)_ ,
as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that if either of _Section
2.6(d)(ii)_ or _Section 2.6(d)(iv)_ applies with respect to Merger Cash
Elections and Merger Stock Elections (including deemed Merger Stock Elections
with respect to No Election Shares), such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
surrendered subject to a Merger Cash Election for purposes of whichever of
such section(s) applies.

(e)

 

No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger.
All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a Company Stockholder would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated
and, if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such Company
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
without interest equal to the product of the Average Trading Price and the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Stockholder
would otherwise have been entitled.

 

(f)

 

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, then (without duplication of any adjustment thereto
pursuant to _Section 1.1(f)_ ) the Merger Consideration and any other
calculation based on or relating to the Parent Common Stock or the Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares such that there shall be the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement if such event had not occurred.

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the
extent required by the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock which are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
treated as set forth in _Section 2.6(d)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 2.6(g)_ , if this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any Company Stockholder to be
paid the fair value of such Company Stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL which are received by the Company relating to such
holders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

 

(h)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary except for the
limitation set forth in _Section 2.6(d)(iv)_ , if the product of (i) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the
Merger in exchange for Company Shares and (ii) the Testing Price (as defined
below in this _Section 2.6(h)_ ) of Parent Common Stock (such product being
the " _Value of Stock Consideration_ ") is less than forty percent (40%) of
the sum of the Value of Stock Consideration and the amount of Non-Stock
Consideration (as defined below

 

 

16

 



 



 

in this _Section 2.6(h)_ ), then the amount of cash Merger Consideration to be
paid in the Merger in exchange for Company Common Stock shall be reduced and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger in exchange
for Company Common Stock shall be increased, with the adjustment based on the
Parent Common Stock being valued at the Average Trading Price, so as to cause
such percentage to be equal to forty percent (40%). If such an adjustment is
required, each stockholder whose shares of Company Common Stock are being
converted into the Cash Consideration in the Merger shall bear such
stockholders proportionate share of such adjustment, based on the percentage
of the aggregate Cash Consideration to which such stockholder is otherwise
entitled pursuant to the Merger under this Agreement to the aggregate Cash
Consideration to which all stockholders are otherwise entitled pursuant to the
Merger under this Agreement. If due to the limitation set forth in _Section
2.6(d)(iv)_ the number of shares of Parent Common Stock cannot be increased to
cause such percentage to be equal to forty percent (40%), then (i) no
adjustment shall be required, (ii) the Second Merger shall not be required to
be completed, and (iii) the failure to have such percentage equal 40% means
there is " _Inadequate Continuity of Interest_ " for purposes of this
Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 2.6(h)_ , (i) the " _Non-Stock
Consideration_ " shall mean the sum of (A) any cash consideration paid
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, and (B) any other cash or property
(other than shares of Parent Common Stock) that is transferred, paid or
distributed by Parent (or any Person related to Parent within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) to holders of Company Common Stock
in exchange for Company Common Stock in connection with the Offer and Merger
(including any cash paid on account of Dissenting Shares and in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and (ii) the " _Testing Price_ "
shall be the average of the high and low price per share of Parent Common
Stock trading prices on the NYSE on the Closing Date.

 

 _Section 2.7_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a)

 

At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with BNY Mellon Shareowner Services or another bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging
the Merger Consideration for (i) certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "). Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent from time to time as needed and promptly following a request therefor
from the Exchange Agent, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_. Any Merger Consideration deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_ out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Parent will pay all fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

 

(b)

 

Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock as of the Effective Time a form letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates, if any, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. 

 

 

17

 



 



 



 

(c)

 

Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled
to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for
each share of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or for each
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
exchange that (i) either such surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the exchange by a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or such Person shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.7(c)_ , each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent,
for all purposes, only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
evidenced by such Certificate or such Uncertificated Share. 

 

(d)

 

Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the Company
Stockholders for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any Company Stockholders who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 2.7_ shall thereafter look only to Parent to claim
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(e)

 

No dividends or other distributions that are declared on or after the
Effective Time on Parent Common Stock or are payable to the holders of record
thereof on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the Company
Stockholders entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates
representing Parent Common Stock until such Company Stockholders surrender
their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as provided in this _Section
2.7_. Subject to the effect of applicable Law, there shall be paid to the
holder of record of the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock
(or, if applicable under _Section 2.7(c)_ , the other Person) (i) at the time
of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to whole shares
of such Parent Common Stock having a record date on or after the Effective
Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common
Stock having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no event shall the
Company Stockholder or other Person entitled to receive such dividends or
other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other
distributions.

 

 

18

 



 



 

(f)

 

Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any Company Stockholder for
any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g)

 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Exchange Agent with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof would have been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
pursuant to _Section 2.7(c),_ without any interest thereon, together with any
amounts then payable pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_.

 

(h)

 

All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock (other than the rights, if any, under _Section
2.7(e)_ ).

 

(i)

 

Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for
which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand and upon its certification to the Exchange Agent that Parent has
otherwise paid for such shares.

 

 _Section 2.8_

 

 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article 2.

 

 _Section 2.9_

 

 _Company Equity Awards; Warrants_. 

 

(a)

 

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock then
outstanding under any employee stock option or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be canceled in consideration for which the holder thereof
shall thereupon be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time cash
(without interest thereon) in an amount equal to the difference of (i) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the excess, if
any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option, minus (ii) all applicable
federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld, if any.

 

(b)

 

As of the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Warrant_ ") then outstanding, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be canceled by the Company in consideration for
which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive promptly after
the Effective Time, cash without interest thereon)

 

  

19

 



 



 

in an amount (if any) equal to the difference of (i) the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, and
(B) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, minus (ii) all
applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld, if any.

 

(c)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of
Company Options and Company Warrants appropriate notices, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to this Agreement. Not more than ten (10) nor less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a list, in form reasonably acceptable to Parent, of the
number of Company Options and Company Warrants expected to be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the names of the holders thereof
and in each case together with the applicable mailing addresses, tax
identification numbers and other information relating to such holders and
participants as Parent may reasonably require in connection with the payments
to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.9_. Parent may take such actions, as
promptly as practicable, prior to making any payment under this _Section 2.9_
, as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in order to verify the right of
any person to receive such a payment hereunder, the identifying information
relating to such person and whether any withholding is required with respect
thereto and, if so, the amount thereof. 

 

(d)

 

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, if the terms of any Company
Warrant or Company Option (or applicable Company Plan) do not themselves
provide for or authorize the treatment thereof set forth in _Section 2.9(a)_
or _Section 2.9(b)_ , the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the holder thereof to such treatment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) without Parents consent, the Company shall not pay any
additional consideration to any such holder to obtain such consent and (ii) if
such consent cannot be obtained prior to the Effective Time, then the
treatment of such Company Option or Company Warrant at the Effective Time
shall be as provided by the terms of such Company Option (or applicable
Company Plan) or Company Warrant.

 

 _Section 2.10_

 

 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Stockholder or
other Person such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law or treaty. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder or other Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

 

 _Section 2.11_

 

 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, Permits or assets
of either of the Company

 

 

20

 



 



 

or Merger Sub, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their
designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such other acts and things as may be necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations
rights, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges,
powers, franchises, properties, Permits or assets of the Company or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

 _Section 2.12_

 

 _Tax Free Reorganization_. Except if the All-Cash Election is made or there
is Inadequate Continuity of Interest, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are intended to be treated as an integrated transaction and to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
This Agreement is intended to constitute a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Article 3. 
  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall identify exceptions by specific section
references, the Company represents and warrants to Parent as set forth below.

 

 _Section 3.1_

 

 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has
full corporate power and authority and is in possession of all franchises,
grants, Permits and orders ("Company Approvals") required to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, and the Company has not received any notice of proceedings relating
to the revocation or modification of any Company Approvals, except in each
case where the revocations or modifications, or the failure to have such power
and authority and to possess such Company Approvals would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified or licensed which would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered a complete, true and correct copy of the
Company Organizational Documents, as amended to date, to Parent. The Company
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Organizational Documents.
The minute books of the Company contain true, complete and accurate records in
all material respects of all meetings and other corporate actions held or
taken since January 1, 2006, of the Company Stockholders and the Company Board
(including the committees of the Company Board).

 

 _Section 3.2_

 

 _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the

 

 

21

 



 



 

Company Stockholder Approval (if required under applicable Law in order to
permit the consummation of the Merger) and the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
Board at a meeting duly called and held on or prior to the date hereof, has,
by unanimous vote (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are in the best
interests of the Company Stockholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (c) declared that this
Agreement is advisable, (d) resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer and exchange their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and, if required under applicable Law in order to
permit the consummation of the Merger, vote their shares of Company Common
Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the unanimous recommendations referred to in this clause
(d), subject to the proviso regarding unanimity in Section 1.2(a) are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Recommendations"), and (e)
to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the
Company not to be subject to any state takeover law or other similar Law that
might otherwise apply to the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 3.3_

 

 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not require any action, order, or Permit

with the DGCL and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company is qualified to do business; (b) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (c) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; (d) such compliance
as may be required under any applicable state securities or Blue Sky Laws; and
(e) other actions, orders, Permits, declarations and filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not prevent or delay consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement, and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 _Section 3.4_

 

 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement, the Offer, and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a)
contravene or conflict with the Company Organizational Documents or the
Organizational Documents of any Company Subsidiary, (b) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 3.3, contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound or affected, (c) constitute a breach of or
default under (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both could
reasonably be expected to become such a breach or default) or give rise (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both) to a right of termination,
amendment,

 

 

22

 



 



 

cancellation or acceleration under any agreement, contract, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, concession, franchise, Permit or other similar
authorization or joint venture, limited liability or partnership agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or by which the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or affected, or (d) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than, in the case of clauses (b), (c)
and (d), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, Liens or other
occurrences that would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated or an entity duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing, under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has all powers and
authority and is in possession of all franchises, grants, Permits and orders
(" _Company Subsidiary Approvals_ ") required to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and
no Company Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the
revocation or modification of any Company Subsidiary Approvals, except in each
case where the revocations or modifications, or the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
or to possess the Company Subsidiary Approvals, would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
or entity to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed which would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)

 

The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Company Subsidiaries and the total number of authorized, issued and
outstanding Equity Interests of each such Company Subsidiary. Each of the
outstanding Equity Interests of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and not issued in violation of
any preemptive rights of any Company Subsidiary shareholder or other equity
holder, were issued in compliance with all applicable federal, state and
foreign Laws, and such Equity Interests owned by the Company or another
Company Subsidiary are owned free

 

 

24

 



 



 

and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all of the Equity Interests in each Company Subsidiary are
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. Except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character, including without limitation, voting agreements or arrangements,
relating to the issued or unissued Equity Interests of any Company Subsidiary
or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any
Equity Interests of, or other Equity Interests in, any Company Subsidiary.
There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity
Interests of any Company Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Company Subsidiary or any other entity, except for loan commitments and other
funding obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business.

 

(c)

 

The Company has made available to Parent complete, true and correct copies of
the Organizational Documents, as amended to date, of each Company Subsidiary.
The Organizational Documents of each Company Subsidiary are in full force and
effect. No Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Organizational Documents. The minute books of each Company Subsidiary contain
true, complete and accurate records in all material respects of all meetings
and other corporate actions held or taken since January 1, 2006, of its
shareholders and Board of Directors (including the committees of its Board of
Directors).

 

 _Section 3.7_

 

 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(a)

 

The Company and each Company Subsidiary has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed with the SEC (collectively, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ ") since January 1, 2006. The Company SEC Documents, including all
Company SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement, (i) were or will
be filed on a timely basis, (ii) were or will be prepared in accordance with
the requirements of applicable Law, and (iii) did not at the time they were
filed, or will not at the time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b)

 

Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Documents, including any
Company SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to or
on the Effective Time, have been or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and each fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of its operations and cash flows and changes in financial position for the
periods indicated, except that any unaudited interim financial statements do
not contain the notes required by GAAP and were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments, which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount, either individually or in the aggregate.

 

(c)

 

The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures"
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial and
non-financial)

 

 

25

 



 



 

relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company required by Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley
with respect to such reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in Sarbanes-Oxley.

 

(d)

 

The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys
financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to the Parent a summary of any such
disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2006. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "significant deficiency" in internal controls means an
internal control deficiency that adversely affects an entitys ability to
initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data
reliably in accordance with GAAP. A "significant deficiency" may be a single
deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal controls means a
significant deficiency or a combination of significant deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material adverse misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected.

 

 _Section 3.8_

 

 _No Material Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, due or to become due, determined,
determinable or otherwise, other than: (a) liabilities or obligations fully
reflected or reserved against on the Companys consolidated balance sheet

termination pay, or paid any bonus; or (i) any action, event, occurrence,
development or state of circumstances or facts that has had, or would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

party to any Claim, and there is no Claim pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of

ERISA, maintains or contributes to, or has any actual or potential liability
with respect to, an employee pension benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA

provisions of all applicable Law. The Company and the ERISA Affiliates have
performed all obligations required to be performed by any of them with respect
to, are not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and the
Company has no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any
Company Plan. No legal action, suit or claim is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Plan (other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course) and, except as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists
that could give rise to any such action, suit or claim. No Company Plan is
currently under audit or review by any governmental body and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no such audit or review has been threatened. Except as

ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Section 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 or 430 of the Code.

 

(e)

 

Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code (including each trust established in
connection with such a Company Plan that is intended to be exempt from Federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code) has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, or is covered by an opinion from the IRS,
that it is so qualified, and, except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company is not aware of any fact or event that could adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Company Plan. Except as disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no trust maintained or contributed to by the
Company or any of the ERISA Affiliates is intended to be qualified as a
voluntary employees beneficiary association or is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(f)

 

Except for matters disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has
been no non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Plan. The
Company and each of the ERISA Affiliates has not incurred any liability for
any civil penalties arising under ERISA or for any excise Tax arising under
Sections 4971 through 4980F of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, no fact or event exists that could give rise to
any such liability.

 

(g)

 

All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect to
any Company Plan have been made on or before their due dates.

 

 

30

 



 



 



 

(h)

 

Except for employment, change of control, severance, consulting or other
similar contracts with any Company Employees disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to
any such contracts.

 

(i)

 

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
conjunction with another event, entitle any Company Employee to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided
herein, or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the
compensation due any such Company Employee, except as expressly provided
herein.

 

(j)

 

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no
amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not
written) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or any change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan that would
increase in any material respect the expense of maintaining such Company Plan
above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent
fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. 

 

(k)

 

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, all "nonqualified
deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party at all times since
December 31, 2004 have complied with the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3)
and (4) of Section 409A(a) by their terms and have been operated in accordance
with such requirements. No participant in such a Company Plan will incur any
Taxes on any benefit under such Company Plan before the date as of which such
benefit is actually paid to such participant. No event has occurred that
would be treated by Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of
Section 83 of the Code. No Company Plan requires the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to gross up a payment to any former or current employee, officer,
director or contractor of Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Tax related
payments under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(l)

 

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each
Company Plan that is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States
or that covers any employee residing or working outside the United States, (i)

if no such requirement applies, adequate reserves therefore have been
established on the accounting statements of the applicable Company or ERISA
Affiliate; and (iii) no liability or obligation of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate exists with respect to such Plan that has not been disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(m)

 

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not
established any trust for funding any of the Company Plans. 

 

(n)

 

The Company Options have been authorized, approved and granted in accordance
with the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.162-27(e)(2)(vi) and
any other requirements under Law such that any amount of any compensation
deduction to the Company resulting from the exercise of any Company Option
will not be limited by Section 162 of the Code. The exercise price of all
Company Options is at least equal to the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock on the date such Company Options were granted and such

 

 

31

 



 



 

Company Options are fully exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and neither
the Company nor Parent has incurred any liability or obligation to withhold
Taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting of any Company Options.

 

(o)

 

The adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each Company Plan since
the discussions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby between the
Company and Parent began has been approved as an employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent
directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto
and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise
applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution of this
Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board, the compensation
committee thereof or its independent directors.

contract, agreement, lease, Permit, franchise or other instrument or

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)

 

The Company and each Company Subsidiary have all Permits under all Laws and
from all Governmental Entities necessary to carry on their respective
businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to have any Permit

Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c)

 

The Company and each of its officers and directors are in compliance with, and
have complied in all material respects with (a) the applicable provisions of
Sarbanes-Oxley and (b) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of NASDAQ. With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K,

Company and each Company Subsidiary violate the trademark, service mark, trade
name, patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how or any other proprietary or
intellectual property right (collectively, "Intellectual Property") of any
third party. Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary own or
have a valid license or other right to use the Intellectual Property, domain
name(s), and computer hardware or

software used in the business of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, as

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice of infringement of
or challenge to, and there are no Claims pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened, with respect to the rights of others to the use of, any
Company Intellectual Property that if determined adversely to the Company
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Parent, Merger Sub, and Company will have the continued ability to
continue to use the Company Intellectual Property as it is currently being
used without obtaining further licenses or permissions from the owner thereof
or the payment of any additional fees relating to continued use thereof.

 

 _Section 3.15_

 

 _Transaction Fees; Opinion of Financial Advisors_.

 

(a)

 

Except for Baird, whose fees and expenses will be borne by the Company, there
is no investment banker, financial advisor, broker, finder or other

the Company or any Company Subsidiary which is entitled to any fee or
commission from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates upon consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other

furnished to Parent complete and correct copies of all agreements, as amended

one hand, and Baird, on the other hand, pursuant to which either such firm
would be entitled to any payment relating to the Offer, the Merger and the

obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, due or to become due, determined,

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; and (c) liabilities or obligations that arise under

 _Section 4.9_

 

 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, since September 30, 2009, except as otherwise expressly contemplated

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b) any
change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or practices (other

any Claim, and there is no Claim pending, or to the knowledge of Parent
threatened, against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective

of an adverse determination and which, if adversely determined, that would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is party to any
Claim, and there is no Claim pending, or to the knowledge of Parent
threatened, challenging this Agreement

agency, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, consolidated,
combined and unitary Tax Returns (collectively, the "Parent Returns") by, or
with respect to, Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have been timely filed in
accordance with all applicable Laws. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has
timely paid and discharged all material Taxes due and payable (other than
Taxes which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
for which adequate reserves are reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet), and
the Parent Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects.
The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to Parent and each
Parent Subsidiary that are reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet are adequate
to pay the Tax liabilities accruing through the date thereof. There is no
action, suit, proceeding, audit or Claim now proposed in writing, pending or,

respect of any Taxes that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

lease, Permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets is bound
or affected, except for such conflicts, defaults or violations which would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)

 

Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have all Permits under all Laws and from all
Governmental Entities necessary to carry on their respective businesses as

Adverse Effect.

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (b) to

14D-9, the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, the Post-Effective

 _Section 5.4_

 

 _Stockholder Approval; Preparation of Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_. 

 

(a)

 

If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by applicable Law in order
to consummate the Merger and unless the All-Cash Election shall have been
made, Parent and the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
Appointment Time, prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and Parent and the Company shall prepare and Parent shall file with
the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement (the " _Post-
Effective Amendment_ ") for the offer and sale of Parent Shares pursuant to
the Merger and in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Unless the All-
Cash Election is made, each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent
to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Post-Effective
Amendment will be made by Parent, or with respect to the Proxy Statement will
be made by the Company, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Post-Effective
Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for the amendment of the
Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. The Company will advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the
amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or

 

 

50

 



 



 

supplement to either of the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Laws, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 

(b)

 

If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by applicable Law in order
to consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish, prior to or as soon as
practicable following the date upon which the Post-Effective Amendment becomes
effective, a record date (which shall be prior to or as soon as practicable
following the date upon which the Post-Effective Amendment becomes effective)
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of considering the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and (with the consent of Parent) such other matters as may in the
reasonable judgment of the Company be appropriate for consideration at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been
called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting (other than for the absence of a quorum) without the
consent of Parent. The Post-Effective Amendment and the Proxy Statement shall
include the opinion of Baird referred to in _Section 3.15(b)_ and, subject to
the Companys right, pursuant to _Section 5.6_ , to withhold, withdraw,
modify, change or fail to make the Recommendations, the Company Board shall
include the Recommendations in the Post-Effective Amendment and the Proxy
Statement. Unless the Company Board shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified,
changed or failed to make its Recommendations in compliance with _Section 5.6_
, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required
by the DGCL to effect the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record
date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall not be limited by or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c)

 

Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_ , if Parent, Merger Sub
and any other Subsidiary of Parent shall own collectively by virtue of the
Offer or otherwise at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions
(including actions referred to in _Section 5.4(a)_ , as applicable) to cause
the Merger to become effective, as soon as practicable after the Final
Expiration Date, without a meeting of or approval by the Company Stockholders,
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

 _Section 5.5_

 

 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a)

 

Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement to which the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary is a party (which such Person shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty to waive), from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party shall, and shall
cause each of their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants,

 

 

51

 



 



 

consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors, agents and
other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to (i) provide to
the other party and its Representatives access at reasonable times upon prior
notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries and to the books and records
thereof and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of
such party and its Subsidiaries as the other party or its Representatives may
reasonably request.

 

(b)

 

Until the Appointment Time, the Company and Parent will, and the Parent will
cause Merger Sub to, continue to comply with the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent in effect as of
November 19, 2009 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") with respect to all
information obtained from another party.

 

(c)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or in any
other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto
are parties or by which they are bound, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein
shall not apply to the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Merger upon the
earliest to occur of (i) the date of the public announcement of discussions
relating to the Merger, (ii) the date of the public announcement of the
Merger, or (iii) the date of the execution of the Agreement, all within the
meaning of and to the extent required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party is restricted in discussing
the Tax structure or the Tax treatment of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement with its tax advisors at any time.

 

 _Section 5.6_

 

 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a)

 

Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cease immediately and
cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with
any parties (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and promptly request that all confidential information
with respect thereto furnished on behalf of the Company be returned.

 

(b)

 

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly,
take (and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall authorize or
permit its Representatives or affiliates to take) any action to (i) encourage,
solicit, initiate or facilitate (including by way of furnishing assistance or
information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may be reasonably expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than this
Agreement and any confidentiality and standstill agreement as provided for
below) or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) enter into or
participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
information to, any Person in connection with, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal from another Person that was not
solicited after the date hereof or that did not involve a breach of this
_Section 5.6_ and that the Company

 

 

52

 



 



 

Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors, is, or is likely to become, a Superior Proposal, the
Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal and subject to the
Companys compliance with this _Section 5.6(b)_ and _Section 5.6(c)_ , (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, provided that the Company
contemporaneously furnishes a copy to Parent to the extent it has not done so
previously, and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that (1) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person, the Company Board, after consultation with and taking into
consideration the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good
faith that such action is required for the Company Board to comply with their
fiduciary duties to the Company imposed by the DGCL, (2) prior to furnishing
such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person, (3) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company receives from such
Person an executed confidentiality and "standstill" agreement on terms no less
restrictive to such other Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and that
permits the notice and information to Parent contemplated in this _Section
5.6_ to be provided, and (4) the Company keeps Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and details of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(c)

 

The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than
twenty four (24) hours after receipt thereof), advise Parent (the "
_Acquisition Proposal Notice_ ") of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
received by it relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal and of the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including the
identity of the Person and its affiliates making the same, or of any
information requested from it or of any negotiations or discussions being
sought to be initiated with it, shall furnish to Parent a copy of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, if it is in writing, or a written summary of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, if it is not in writing, and shall
keep Parent fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within twenty
four (24) hours) with respect to the status and details, including amendments
or proposed amendments, with respect to the foregoing.

 

(d)

 

Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, or
shall authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, any of the Recommendations, (ii) approve, endorse, or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than the Offer and the Merger) (any action described in this clause
(ii) or the immediately preceding clause (i) shall be an " _Adverse Change in
Recommendations_ "), (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Offer and the
Merger) or (iv) release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or
permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement under which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
has any rights, or fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or
cause to be enforced such agreement at the request of Parent. Nothing
contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act provided that such
position is

 

 

53

 



 



 

consistent with the Companys obligations herein. Further notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, in
circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and taking into
consideration the advice of independent legal counsel after the Company has
complied with its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ , that an Adverse
Change in Recommendations is required for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the Company imposed by the DGCL, the Company Board may
make such Adverse Change in Recommendations (if, and only to the extent, so
required) no earlier than five (5) Business Days following the day of delivery
of written notice to Parent of the Company Boards intention to do so, which
notice specifies in reasonable detail the reasons for the Adverse Change in
Recommendations. Further, notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that a Superior Proposal is made in
circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement and the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors, that such Superior Proposal is still a Superior Proposal
after the Company has complied with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ , the Company Board may if, and only to the extent that the Company
Board, after consultation with and taking into consideration the advice of
independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is,
required for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company imposed by the DGCL, take any of the actions specified in clauses (i)
or (ii), no earlier than five (5) Business Days following the day of delivery
of written notice to Parent of the Company Boards intention to do so.

 

(e)

 

For a period of not less than five (5) Business Days after Parents receipt
from the Company of a notice of an impending Adverse Change in Recommendations
as contemplated in _Section 5.6(d)_ , the Company shall, if requested by
Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate in good faith with Parents Representatives, to revise this
Agreement in an effort to obviate the need for such Adverse Change in
Recommendations to be made. For a period of not less than five (5) Business
Days after Parents receipt from the Company of an Acquisition Proposal Notice
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines
to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate in good faith with Parents Representatives, to revise this
Agreement in an effort to make the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. For avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained in the Confidentiality Agreement will prohibit Parent
and Merger Sub from continuing the Offer or from taking any other actions
permitted or contemplated hereunder.

 

 _Section 5.7_

 

 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

 

(a)

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be
obtained or made by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(including, without limitation, those in connection

 

 

54

 



 



 

with the HSR Act and any applicable antitrust or competition Laws of any other
jurisdiction), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
and therein, including, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger, and
(iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Offer and the Merger
required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any other
applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act, and (C) any
other applicable Law; provided, that Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith, _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.7(a)_ shall require Parent or
the Company to agree to (1) enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent
decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Entity or other Person
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (2) the requirement
of divestiture of assets or property or (3) the requirement of expenditure of
money by Parent or the Company to a third party in exchange for any such
consent referred to in clause (ii) of this _Section 5.7(a)_ (other than the
payment of applicable filing fees). The Company and Parent shall furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing under
the rules and regulations of any applicable Law (including all information
required to be included in the Offer Documents, the Registration Statement,
the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement and the Post-Effective Amendment) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of
the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all other actions
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

 

(c)

 

The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
third party consents that are (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect
from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect from occurring after the Effective Time. In the event that
either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the
first sentence of this _Section 5.7(c)_ , such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by
the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and
Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses
resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective
Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

 

(d)

 

From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the parties
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any pending or,
to the

 

 

55

 



 



 

knowledge of such party, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other
proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i)
challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or the conversion of Company Common Stock into the Merger Consideration
or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger or otherwise limit the right of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own
or operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

 

 _Section 5.8_

 

 _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the
Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its operations.

 

 _Section 5.9_

 

 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty of that party to be untrue or inaccurate
or that would result or be reasonably likely to result in any condition that
is to be complied with or satisfied pursuant to this Agreement not to be so
complied with or satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall
not cure any breach of any representation or warranty that was untrue on the
date hereof or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.

 

 _Section 5.10_

 

 _Public Announcements_. 

 

(a)

 

Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before such Person or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Person on their behalf issues any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the NYSE or
NASDAQ.

 

(b)

 

Before any written communications related to the Offer of any party hereto or
any of their respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the
Securities Act) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the
media, employee, client, customer or other third-party or otherwise made
accessible on the website of such party or any such participant, as applicable
(whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise),
or (ii) used by any executive officer, key employee or advisor of such party
or any such participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings
with any such third parties, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall
(or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good faith with respect
to any such written communications related to the Offer for purposes of, among
other things, determining whether that communication constitutes "tender offer
material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14d-2 or Rule 14d-6 of the
Exchange Act, as applicable. Each party shall (or shall cause any such
participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on

 

 

56

 



 



 

any such written communications related to the Offer. For purposes of the
foregoing, written communications related to the Offer shall include, with
respect to any Person, any document or other written communication prepared by
or on behalf of that Person, or any document or other material or information
posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether in written,
video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise).

 

 _Section 5.11_

 

 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the
NYSE a listing application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Offer and the Merger (the "Parent Shares"), and
shall cause the Parent Shares and such other shares to be approved for listing
on such exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Acceptance Date or the Effective Time, as the case may be.

 

 _Section 5.12_

 

 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

 

 _Section 5.13_

 

 _Employee Benefit Matters_. Annex II hereto sets forth certain agreements
with respect to Companys employee benefit matters.

 

 _Section 5.14_

 

 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a)

 

Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that the indemnification
obligations set forth in the Company Organizational Documents (including
without limitation elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses) shall survive the Merger (and, prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub to reflect such
provisions) and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior to
the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or
agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who served at the request of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee,
partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,
unless such amendment or modification is required by Law.

 

(b)

 

The Company shall purchase one or more prepaid policies to provide to the
Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides for six (6) years from the Appointment Time, coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time that is no less favorable than
the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which have been
previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage for the period of six (6)
years from the Appointment Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior consent
from Parent shall be necessary if the total cost to the Company for such
prepaid policies is more than $500,000. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company to, maintain any such prepaid policies purchased by the Company prior
to the Appointment Time in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. The obligations under this _Section 5.14_ shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.14_ applies without the

 

 

57

 



 



 

consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.14_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.14_ ).

 

(c)

 

In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or the surviving corporation
in the Second Merger) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.14_.

 

(d)

 

The provisions of this _Section 5.14_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, each individual identified in _Section 5.14(a)_ and his or her
heirs and representatives, and are in addition to and not in substitution for,
any other right to indemnification or contribution that such person may have
under the Organizational Documents of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, under any acquisition contract, under the Law or otherwise.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each such indemnified Person under this
_Section 5.14_.

 

(e)

 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this _Section 5.14_ may not be amended or modified without the
approval of each of the individuals identified in _Section 5.14(a)_ , except
that prior to the Appointment Time this _Section 5.14_ may be amended with the
concurrence of all of the members of the Company Board then in office.

 

 _Section 5.15_

 

 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation or any
similar provision of the Company Organizational Documents shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions described herein may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms described herein and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute, regulation or provision on the
transactions described herein.

 

 _Section 5.16_

 

 _Delivery of Stockholder List_. The Company shall arrange to have its
transfer agent deliver to Parent or its designee, from time to time prior to
the Effective Time, a true and complete list setting forth the names and
addresses of the Company Stockholders, their holdings of Company Common Stock
as of the latest practicable date, and such other stockholder information as
Parent may reasonably request.

 

 _Section 5.17_

 

 _Expenses_. 

 

(a)

 

All Expenses (as defined below) incurred by the parties hereto in connection
with this Agreement shall be borne solely and entirely by the party which has
incurred the same, regardless of whether the Offer and the Merger are
consummated, except that each of Parent and Company shall share equally in the
filing fee incurred in connection with the pre-merger notification and report
forms under the HSR Act.

 

 

58

 



 



 



 

(b)

 

" _Expenses_ " as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to the party
and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation and execution of this Agreement, the
solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _Section 5.18_

 

 _Letter of Company s Accountants_. If requested by Parent and unless the
All-Cash Election shall have been made, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent "comfort" letters of
Ernst and Young LLP, the Companys independent public accountants, dated the
date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and the
Effective Time, respectively, and addressed to Parent, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and reasonably customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement and transactions
such as those contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

 _Section 5.19_

 

 _Second Merger; Plan of Reorganization_. Unless the All-Cash Election shall
have been made or there is Inadequate Continuity of Interest, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, but not later than fifteen (15) days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall adopt and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to adopt an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with
respect to the Second Merger pursuant to which, as soon as practicable, the
Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Parent or, at Parents
election, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with Parent or such subsidiary
being the surviving corporation of the Second Merger. It is intended that,
unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made or there is Inadequate
Continuity of Interest and absent a change in facts or Law subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, (a) the Second Merger shall occur, (b) the acquisition
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, followed by the
Merger and the Second Merger, together would qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (c) this Agreement would
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation § 1.368-2(g) of the regulations under the Code. 

 

 _Section 5.20_

 

 _Adoption of Plan of Reorganization; Tax Actions_. This Agreement is the
adoption by Parent of the Offer and the Mergers as a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless the All-Cash Election is
exercised or there is Inadequate Continuity of Interest, Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts before and after the Effective Time, to cause
the Offer and the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code. Parent will file all Tax Returns reporting the Offer and the
Mergers as a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code except to
the extent otherwise required by Law, and will comply with all federal and
state Tax reporting requirements with respect to the Offer and the Mergers.

 

 _Section 5.21_

 

 _Company Adoption of Plan of Reorganization_. This Agreement is the adoption
by the Company of the Offer and the Mergers as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless the All-Cash Election is
exercised or there is Inadequate Continuity of Interest, the Company will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Offer and the Mergers to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

59

 



 



 



 

 _Section 5.22_

 

 _Reorganization Matters_. The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parents and the Companys
respective tax counsels a certificate containing representations reasonably
requested by such counsel in connection with rendering of any opinion to be
issued by such counsel with respect to the treatment of the Offer and the
Mergers as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Parents and
Companys respective tax counsels shall be entitled to rely upon such
representations in rendering any such opinions.

 

Article 6.

to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following

knowledge of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, threatened in writing
wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or charge
would (i) prevent consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) cause any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be rescinded following consummation thereof or (iii) affect adversely the
right or powers of Parent to own, operate or control the Company, and no such

illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give
effect to the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Disclosure Schedules, the annexes, exhibits and schedules hereto, and the
other

upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b)

 

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State

or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal
court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court, and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service

(c)

 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY

would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the parties termination rights
under Section 7.1, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

 

 _Section 8.15_

 

 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its
respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Parent
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete performance by

right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section

ANNEX I

 

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, subject to the terms of the
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept for
exchange or exchange or deliver any shares of Parent Common Stock for (subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay
for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock after the termination or
withdrawal of the Offer)) any shares of Company Common Stock tendered, if by
the Final Expiration Date, (1) the Minimum Condition shall not have been
satisfied, (2) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been
terminated, (3) unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, the
Registration Statement shall not have become effective under the Securities
Act or shall be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop
order, (4) unless the All-Cash Election shall have been made, the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger shall not have
been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
and shall not be exempt from such requirement under then applicable Laws,
regulations and rules of the NYSE, or (5) at any time on or after the date of
the Agreement and prior to the acceptance for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, any of the following conditions exist and
are continuing:

 

(a) there shall have been any action taken, or any statute, law, ordinance,
rule, regulation, injunction, judgment, order or decree proposed, entered,
enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or
the Merger by any Governmental Entity, other than the application of the
waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or the Merger, or there
shall be pending or threatened in writing any action, suit or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity against Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that seeks to (i) prohibit, or make illegal,
the acceptance for payment of or payment for shares of Company Common Stock or
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) render Parent or Merger Sub
unable to accept for payment or pay for some or all of the shares of Company
Common Stock, (iii) impose material limitations on the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock, including the right to vote the shares of Company Common
Stock purchased by it on all matters properly presented to the Company
Stockholders, (iv) prohibit or impose any material limitations on Parents
direct or indirect ownership or operation (or that of any of its affiliates)
of all or a material portion of their or the Companys businesses or assets,
(v) compel Parent or its affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any portion
of the business or assets of the Company or Parent and or their respective
Subsidiaries which would be material in the context of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
(vi) oblige the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to pay
material damages or otherwise become subject to materially adverse
consequences in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or (vii) otherwise result in a Company Material Adverse Effect
(disregarding for this purpose the effect of clause (i) of the definition of
such term) or, as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 


  

 



 



 



 



 



 

(b) the Company shall have materially breached any of its covenants,
obligations or agreements under the Agreement;

 

(c) (i) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in the
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect shall not have been true and correct as of the date of the Agreement or
shall not be true and correct on and as of the Final Expiration Date with the
same force and effect as if made as of such date, or (ii) any representation
or warranty of the Company set forth in the Agreement that is not so qualified
shall have not have been true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of the Agreement or shall not be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Final Expiration Date with the same force and effect
as if made as of such date, except for those representations and warranties
which address matters only as of a particular date (which representations
shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such
particular date) (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the
accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update of or modification
to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after
the date of the Agreement shall be disregarded);

 

(d) except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September

occurrence of any event or the arising of any circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 

(e) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;

 

which in the good faith judgment of Parent, in any such case, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or the acceptance for payment of or
payment for the shares of Company Common Stock.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may, subject to the terms of _Section 1.1_ of the Agreement, be waived by
Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time,
in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger Sub. The failure by Parent and
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Annex I_ , neither Parent nor
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth herein to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by the breach of the Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub, or the failure by Parent or Merger to fulfill any of their
respective obligations thereunder.

ANNEX II

 



 

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

 



 

1.

 

 _Conduct of Business Between Date of Signing the Agreement and the Effective
Time_ _._ Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, between the
date of signing of the Agreement and the Effective Time, without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
Company Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) increase in any manner the
compensation or benefits of any Company Employee; (ii) pay a bonus or
incentive payment, whether accrued or unaccrued, to any Company Employee in
excess of the amounts listed on the Company Disclosure Schedule and payable to
such Company Employee pursuant to a Company Plan or pay any other benefit not
required by a Company Plan in effect as of the date hereof (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units or shares, the
acceleration of any vesting restriction or lapse of any forfeiture or other
restriction, and the payment or other provision of any employee bonus or
incentive compensation that is subject to the achievement of established
performance goals where such performance goals are not achieved); _provided_
that this clause (ii) does not prohibit the payment of bonuses to Company
Employees for fiscal 2009 in an aggregate amount up to Five Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000.00), provided that all liability of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries with respect to each such bonus has been
fully accrued in the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of January 3, 2010; (iii) adopt, enter into, establish, or
implement new programs, plans, agreements, policy, trust, fund or other
arrangement providing compensation or benefits for Company Employees or
directors of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including the setting of
any new bonus or incentive compensation performance targets for any Company
Employee), amend or modify existing Company Plans except as required by
applicable law, or as provided herein or in agreements executed by Company
Employees in connection herewith, or make further grants or awards under
existing Company Plans, except as explicitly provided herein; (iv) make
officer title promotions; (v) other than agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business that can be terminated without liability to the
Company (excluding severance in accordance with the Companys Standard
Severance Plan), enter into new consulting agreements or employment agreements
with Company Employees, or prospective employees or independent contractors of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or amend any such existing
agreements, except as provided herein or in agreements executed simultaneously
herewith; (vi) make any matching contributions to the Companys 401(k) plan or
any amendments or modifications to its 401(k) plan, other than amendments or
modifications as provided herein, as required by applicable law or in
agreements executed by Company Employees in connection herewith; (vii) pay
severance to those Company Employees who have not entered into separate
severance agreements with the Company who are terminated by their employer
other than in such amounts and for a period consistent with the Companys
Standard Severance Plan; or (viii) loan or advance any money or other property
to any Company Employee other than advancement of expenses in the ordinary
course of business. The Company agrees that it will not knowingly amend or
unreasonably take, or omit to take any action with respect to any existing
arrangement in a manner that would result in additional employee Tax under
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

 


  

 



 



 



 



 



 

2.

 

 _General_.

 



 

(a)

 

 _Transferred Employees_. Those individuals who are employed by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "Transferred Employees."

 



 

(b)

 

 _Credit for Past Service_. After the Effective Time, Parent shall give or
cause Parent Subsidiaries to give the Transferred Employees full credit for
their prior service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or any
service credited as such in connection with a previous acquisition by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary): (i) for purposes of eligibility (including
without limitation initial participation and eligibility for current benefits)
and vesting under any qualified defined contribution retirement plans
maintained by Parent in which Transferred Employees may be eligible to
participate; and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans,
"cafeteria plans" (as defined in Code Section 125), vacation or paid leave
plans and similar arrangements maintained by Parent. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Parent will not give credit for prior
service to Transferred Employees as regards Parents retiree health plan.

 



 

(c)

 

 _Waiver of Certain Limitations_. Parent will, or will cause Parent
Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees under any of Parents welfare benefit
plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the benefit of the Transferred Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred
Employees will be required to meet the service requirements (recognizing past
service credit given in Section 2(b), above) and other eligibility criteria
under Parents plans.

 



 

(d)

 

 _Parent s Ability to Amend, Modify or Terminate Plans_. Nothing contained
in this _Annex_ shall limit the right of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries, at any
time and from time to time, to amend, modify or terminate, in whole or in
part, any of the plans referenced in this _Annex_ , except that no such
amendment shall nullify the provisions of this _Annex II_ , and Parent hereby
reserves such right.

 



 

3.

 

 _Employee Welfare and Retirement Plans_. The Companys existing health,
dental plans and other employee welfare benefit plans shall remain in effect
until at least the Effective Time. Thereafter, Transferred Employees will be
integrated into Parents health, dental and other employee welfare benefit
plans at a time determined on a plan-by-plan basis by Parent in its sole
discretion. If integration occurs during a plan year, Transferred Employees
shall receive credit under the applicable Parent plan for co-pays, deductibles
and similar expenses that have already been paid or incurred by the
Transferred Employees for that plan year. If Parent so requests, the Company
shall (a) take the necessary and appropriate steps to amend and terminate
and/or discontinue further benefit accruals under any retirement plans of the
Company and/or Company

 


  

 

Annex II  Page 2

 



 



 



 

Subsidiaries and/or to terminate such plans, including the COMSYS 401(k) Plan
and the Pure Solutions, Inc. 401(k) Plan effective as of (i) 11:59 P.M.,
Eastern time, on the day immediately prior to the Acceptance Date where the
percentage of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer is known to be 80% or more as of 5:00 P.M., Eastern time, on the day
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, or (ii) 11:59 P.M., Eastern time, on
the day immediately prior to the Effective Time where the percentage of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer is known to
be at least 50% but less than 80% as of 5:00 P.M., Eastern time, on the day
immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, (b) file a determination letter
application with respect to each such retirement plans termination, each such
application to be reviewed and approved by Parent before it is filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, (c) amend such retirement plan to provide that no
distribution shall be made to a participant until the IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter with respect to such plans termination, unless
a distributable event other than such plans termination has occurred with
respect to such participant, and (d) amend any or all of the Companys and/or
the Company Subsidiaries employee welfare benefit plans prior to the
Acceptance Date to provide that no Parent employee shall be eligible to
participate in any such plan as of or after the Acceptance Date.

 _Options and Restricted Stock_.

 



 

 _(a)_

 

 _Options_. 

 



 

(i)

 

In accordance with Section 2.9 of the Agreement and the provisions of the
relevant plan documents, each Company Option granted under the Companys
Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") or the 2003
Equity Incentive Plan of Personnel Group of America which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time, in exchange for a cash lump-sum payment from the Company equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the excess, if
any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option, subject to all applicable
federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld.

 



 

(ii)

 

Prior to the Effective Date, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take all necessary action to cancel each Company Option outstanding under
the 1995 Equity Participation Plan of Personnel Group of America, Inc. as of
the date of this Agreement; provided that the maximum cash consideration the
Company shall pay to any individual holder of such Company Options as
consideration for such cancellation shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).

 



 

(b)

 

 _Restricted Stock_.

 



 

(i)

 

In accordance with Section 2.6 of the Agreement and the provisions of the
relevant plan documents, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding award of

Annex II  Page 3

 



 



 



 

be terminated in exchange for a right to receive a lump-sum payment from the
Company equal to the product of (A) the number of outstanding shares of
unvested restricted Common Stock under the award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the Cash Consideration, to be paid to the holder only
upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting conditions to the award in effect
as of the date of this Agreement (a "Replacement Award"). Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Administrator (as defined in the
2004 Plan) to take all necessary action to effectuate the termination of such
unvested restricted Company Common Stock in exchange for the Replacement
Awards effective as of the Effective Time, wherein such Replacement Awards
shall provide that any merger of the Company with or into Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary between the Acceptance Date and the one-year anniversary thereof in
which a holder of a Replacement Award becomes employed by the Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary shall not trigger a Qualifying Termination (as defined under
the 2004 Plan).

 



 

(ii)
