The Equity Amount Calculation must include a consolidated pro forma balance
sheet of the Group as per 31 December 2017 prepared on the basis of the
audited annual accounts for 2017 of each of the relevant Group Companies in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. The pro forma consolidation
included in the Equity Amount Calculation must be reviewed by the Companys
auditor. In case of discrepancies between the Accounting Principles and the
principles set out in Schedule 5.2, the principles set out in Schedule 5.2
shall prevail in the Equity Amount Calculation, and each of the Parties shall
be entitled to argue that the principles set out in Schedule 5.2 shall be used
as the basis for preparing the Equity Amount Calculation rather than the
audited annual accounts for 2017 if there is a discrepancy between the two.
The Buyer must procure that the Group makes available all relevant information
and employees reasonably required to enable the Sellers Representatives to
prepare the Equity Amount Calculation.

 



      
 

 



 

5.6.2 The Buyer shall as soon as possible and no later than fifteen (15)

Calculation. This notice must specify in reasonable detail the nature of the
objections and include specific proposals for adjustment of each disputed
matter or item in the Equity Amount Calculation.

 



 

5.6.3 If the Buyer agrees to the Equity Amount Calculation or if the Buyer
does not notify the Sellers Representatives in accordance with and within the
time limit set out in clause 5.6.2 of any objections to the Equity Amount
Calculation, the Equity Amount Calculation and the Final Equity Amount set out
therein shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties.

 



 

5.6.4 If the Buyer notifies the Sellers Representatives in accordance with
and within the time limit set out in clause 5.6.2 of any objections to any
matter or item in the Equity Amount Calculation, the Sellers Representatives
and the Buyer shall attempt to resolve their differences and reach agreement
within fifteen (15) Business Days. If the Parties fail to do so, then (i)
adjustment of the Equity Amount Calculation shall be deemed final and binding
upon the Parties with respect to any undisputed amounts, and any adjustment to
be made in accordance with clause 5.8 shall be made, and (ii) either of the
Parties may ask that the disputed matters be referred to the Expert for
settlement provided that the disputed matters relate to accounting, financial
or calculation matters. As such, the Expert shall act as an expert and not as
an arbitrator and shall not decide on legal issues. The Buyer shall ensure
that the Expert is granted access to all relevant material and employees with
the Group.

 



 

5.6.5 The Expert shall review the objections made by the Buyer and proposed
amendments, if any, by either of the Parties, decide on the disputed matters,
and determine the Equity Amount Calculation. The Expert shall apply the
Accounting Principles and the principles set out in Schedule 5.2. In case of
discrepancies between the Accounting Principles and the principles set out in
Schedule 5.2, Schedule 5.2 shall prevail.

 



 

5.6.6 The Equity Amount Calculation determined by the Expert is final and
binding upon the Parties, and shall, except in case of fraud, or manifest
error, or if the dispute concerns a legal issue, be applied by the Parties.
The Expert shall deliver his/her decision to the Parties no later than twenty
(20) Business Days after having been appointed.

 



 

5.7 **Costs**

 



 

5.7.1 Costs relating to the calculation of the Purchase Price are to be borne
by the respective Parties. The fee to the Expert must be paid in accordance
with the decision made by the Expert, taking into account whether a Party has
prevailed in its argumentation.

 



      
 

 



 

5.8 **Adjustment Amount**

 



 

5.8.1 If in accordance with clause 5.4 the Preliminary Purchase Price must be
or has been paid at Closing, the Purchase Price, and on this basis the
Adjustment Amount, shall be calculated and the Preliminary Purchase Price
shall be adjusted not later than 3 Business Days after the Final Equity Amount
Date.

 



 

5.8.2 If applicable, the adjustment shall be made as follows;

 



 

(A) if the Purchase Price exceeds the Preliminary Purchase Price the Buyer
shall pay an amount corresponding to the Adjustment Amount to the Sellers
Representatives corresponding to such excess.

 



 

(B) if and to the extent the Purchase Price is lower than the Preliminary
Purchase Price the Sellers shall pay an Adjustment Amount to the Buyer
corresponding to such shortfall.

 



 

5.8.3 In the event any Adjustment Amount is payable by the Seller or the
Buyer, as applicable, pursuant to this clause 5.8, such Adjustment Amount
shall be settled as soon as possible and shall include Interest from the
Closing Date until payment unless such missing payment is caused by the
relevant of the Buyer and the Sellers not providing its bank account details
to which the Adjustment Amount can be transferred without undue delay after
the Adjustment Amount has been settled.

prior to Closing, including by making available any relevant information.

 



 

7.3 Upon having conducted due antitrust and/or merger control screening, the
Buyer has concluded that the Transaction will not trigger any requirement to
complete merger filings with the Danish or any foreign competition authority,
including the EU competition authorities. Immediately following the Signing
Date, the Buyer must share the Buyers merger control analysis with the
Sellers. If the Sellers in their reasonable opinion believe that the Buyers
merger control analysis is incorrect and that a merger filing is required in
any jurisdiction, the Parties agree that:

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall promptly apply for any approval from the relevant
competition authorities. The Buyer will keep the Sellers Representatives
informed in writing

 



      
 

 



 

of its communication with the relevant competition authorities and send a copy
of all material sent to the relevant authorities at the request of the
Sellers Representatives. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representatives
is entitled to participate in all significant discussions with the relevant
competition authorities. The Sellers Representatives shall cooperate with the
Buyer and must deliver the documents reasonably relevant for such applications
at the request of the Buyer,

the Buyer shall offer and accept any such commitments and the Buyer shall
without undue delay arrange for or procure that the Buyer and/or any of the
Buyers group companies, respectively, accepts and implements such pre-Closing
actions as are necessary to permit Closing without this giving rise to any
adjustment of the consideration payable for the Sale Shares so that the sale
and transfer of the Sale Shares as contemplated by this Agreement may be
completed. Similarly, post-Closing the Buyer shall procure that the relevant
Group Companies and any of the Buyers group companies undertake and/or

refuses to waive a Closing condition stated in clause 7.1 no later than on the
Long Stop Date;

 



 

(b) the Sellers or the Buyer if facts or circumstances have occurred which
renders any of the Fundamental Warranties untrue in any material respect; or

 



 

(c) by the Parties written agreement.

 



 

7.5 Notwithstanding the above, a Party may not rely on the failure of the
closing conditions to be satisfied as grounds for terminating this Agreement
if such failure is caused by such Partys breach of its obligation to use its
best efforts or to act in good faith to ensure that such closing condition is
duly and timely satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

7.6 In case of termination of this Agreement as set forth in clause 7.4,
neither of the Parties shall have any liability towards the other Party unless
the reason why Closing has not occurred is a consequence of such Party being
in breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement. In case of
termination of this Agreement caused by a Party being in breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled to
exercise any remedy available according to applicable Law and/or this
Agreement. The limitations set out in clause 14.3.1 (De Minimis and Basket),

term.

accordance with the general rules of Danish law, subject to the terms and
limitations stated in this clause 14. However, the Sellers are in no event

rata basis in accordance with the Allocation Principles, unless otherwise

14.1.3 Subject to the terms and limitations of this Agreement, the Buyer shall
make any and all Claims relating to any Breach of any of the Sellers
Warranties (which for the avoidance of doubt do not include the no leakage
indemnity in clause 13.1) under the Insurance Policy, and the Buyer shall have
no recourse or otherwise any right to make any such Claims for Breach of the
Sellers Warranties against the Sellers, except (i) if such Claim is due to
fraud or wilful misconduct by the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date; or
(ii) if such Claim is based on a Breach of the Fundamental Warranties, in
which cases the Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, but only to the extent that the Buyer cannot
obtain coverage under the Insurance Policy for such Claim.

 



 

14.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall have no claim or recourse
against the Sellers for a Breach of any of the Sellers Warranties that may be
excluded from coverage under the Insurance Policy on account of the content of
the Bring Down of Disclosures.

 



 

14.1.5 The Buyer undertakes to ensure that the Insurance Policy provides that
any insurance provider or any other parties deriving rights under the
Insurance Policy shall not raise any Claim for a breach of Sellers Warranties
against the Sellers in respect of or as a result of payments made under the
Insurance Policy except in the event of fraud or wilful misconduct by the
Sellers in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to raise a Claim as set out
in clause 14.8.1.

 



 

14.1.6 In no event shall the limits or unavailability of the Insurance Policy
for any reason affect the Sellers liability under this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

14.1.7 The Sellers have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer for any Loss if
the matter which constitutes such Breach has at Signing with respect to
Warranties , covenants or other obligations effective at Signing or at Closing
with respect to Warranties, covenants or other obligations effective at

provided that this clause 14.1.7 shall not apply in the event of a breach of
the Fundamental Warranties.

 



 

14.1.8 The Sellers make no Warranties and have no obligation to indemnify the
Buyer in respect of information on prospects concerning the future or
otherwise of a forward-looking nature, including business plans, budgets and

Agreement not covered by the Insurance Policy, if such Breach is capable of
being remedied, within 10 (ten) Business Days after receipt of the Buyers
Notice of the Claim. The Claim will cease to exist if the Breach has been duly
remedied by the Sellers or any of them.

 



 

14.2 **Calculation of Loss**

 



 

14.2.1 Any Loss shall be calculated without taking into account any multiple
or other method used for the calculation of the Purchase Price and paid on a
DKK 1 for DKK 1 basis by cash payment.

 



 

14.2.2 The Sellers are not liable to pay indemnification against any Loss for
which a specific provision or write-off with respect to the relevant Loss has
been made in an Annual Report, the Interim Accounts or adjusted for in the pro
forma closing balance sheet (cf. clause 5.6.1).

 



 

14.2.3 Any Loss caused by changed legislation after the Signing Date or
actions taken by the Buyer or the Group after Closing cannot form the basis of
a Claim against the Sellers.

 



 

14.2.4 When calculating a Loss, the Buyer must take into account any amount
and any benefit that the Buyer or the Group has received from a third party as
a result of the Breach, and any such amount and benefit must be set off
against the Buyers Claim against the Sellers, including

 



 

(a) any tax savings that the Buyer, the Buyers Affiliates or a Group Company
has obtained; and

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any compensation or other recovery (including without limitation insurance
proceeds) that the Buyer, the Buyers Affiliates or a Group Company has
received.

 



 

14.2.5 The Sellers indemnification against any Loss will be considered as a
reduction of the Purchase Price.

 



 

14.2.6 The Buyer shall not be allowed to obtain payment or compensation twice
over or in respect of the same matter or incident. If the Buyer subsequently
receives payment from a third party in respect of a Loss against which the
Sellers have already indemnified the Buyer, the Buyer must repay an equal
amount to the Sellers with the addition of Interest from the date on which the
amount was received from such third party.

 



 

14.3 **Liability thresholds and Cap**

 



 

14.3.1 The Sellers are not liable for the Buyers Loss unless;

 



 

(a) each individual Loss (or serial of related Losses arising from
substantially the same matter or circumstance) as finally determined exceeds
DKK 500,000 (" **De Minimis Threshold** "); and

 



 

(b) the total amount of the Buyers Losses, each Loss (or serial of related
Losses arising from substantially the same matter or circumstance) as finally
determined exceeding the De Minimis Threshold, amounts to at least DKK
10,000,000 (" **Basket** ") and in that case only the part of the Loss
exceeding the Basket.

 



 

14.3.2 Further, the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for any and all
claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be limited in total
to an amount equal to DKK 300,000,000 (" **Cap** ").

 



 

14.3.3 Losses not exceeding the De Minimis Threshold once finally determined
shall not qualify for indemnification.

 



 

14.3.4 The limitations set out in clauses 14.3.1 and 14.3.2 shall not apply to
Claims resulting from a breach of the Fundamental Warranties, the covenants
pursuant to clause 15 or any Leakage.

 



 

14.4 **Time limitations**

 



 

14.4.1 The Sellers are not liable for the Buyers Loss unless the Buyer has
given due Notice of the Claim to the Sellers Representatives

 



      
 

 



 

(a) no later than 24 (twenty four) months after the Closing Date, unless the
Claim relates to a breach of the Fundamental Warranties or the Warranties set
out in clauses 6 (Tax) and 11 (Real Property) of Schedule 11.1;

 



 

(b) no later than 7 (seven) years after the Closing Date if the Claim relates
to a Breach of the Sellers Warranties set out in clauses 6 (Tax) and 11 (Real
Property) of Schedule 11.1; and

 



 

(c) no later than 7 (seven) years after the Closing Date if the Claim relates
to a Breach of the Fundamental Warranties.

 



 

14.4.2 Failure to give notice of any Claim within the time limitations
specified in clause 14.4.1 shall always automatically result in the Claim
being considered forfeited by the Buyer.

 



 

14.4.3 The time limitations set out in clause 14.4.1 apply irrespective of
whether the Buyer had any knowledge of the matters giving rise to a Claim
before expiry of the applicable time period.

 



 

14.4.4 The Buyer must irrespective of the matter, fact or circumstance giving
rise to the Claim provide Notice of the Claim no later than 30 (thirty)
Business Days after the Buyer has become aware of the basis of a Claim or a
possible Claim. The Buyers failure to give notice of a Claim within this time
period will not relieve the Sellers from any liability, but to the extent that
the Buyers Loss has increased after the time the Notice of the Claim fell
due, the Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify such increased part of
the Buyers Loss.

 



 

14.5 **Notice of Claims**

 



 

14.5.1 In the event that the Buyer wishes to make a Claim against the Sellers,
or if the Buyer acquires knowledge of a matter which may give rise to a Claim
against the Sellers, the Buyer must give notice (" **Notice** ") of the Claim
to the Sellers Representatives in accordance with clause 14.4.

 



 

14.5.2 Any Notice of a Claim must, to the extent that such information is
available to the Buyer at the time, include a detailed description of the
Claim, its actual and legal basis and a calculation of the Loss or the
estimated Loss. The Notice of the Claim shall to the extent available to the
Buyer be accompanied by all available written documentation necessary to
reasonably support the Claim.

 



 

14.6 **Third Party Claims**

 



 

14.6.1 If a claim has been raised by a third party against a Group Company or
by a Group Company against a third party which may result in or has resulted
in the Buyers Notice

 



      
 

 



 

of a Claim under the Agreement not covered by the Insurance Policy, the
Sellers may decide to take over the conduct of the claim provided that the
Sellers pay all the expenses relating thereto. If the Sellers decide not to
take over the conduct of the claim, the Buyer must (i) keep the Sellers
Representatives informed on an ongoing basis of any significant developments
in the matter; (ii) give the Sellers Representatives and its advisors
unrestricted access to the Buyers and the relevant Group Companys relevant
books, records and accounting material pertaining to such claim, (iii) give
the Sellers Representatives and their advisors reasonable access to consult
with the Buyers, or any relevant Group Companys employees and advisors
relevant in the context of such claim, and (iv) take any such reasonable
action requested by the Sellers Representatives to make, defend or settle any
such claim raised by or against a third party.

 



 

14.7 **Exclusive remedies**

 



 

14.7.1 After Closing, the right to indemnification described in this clause 14
is the Buyers only remedy for Breach. The Buyer is not, except for the
situations described in clause 7.4, entitled to terminate the Agreement or
demand a proportionate reduction of the Purchase Price ( _forholdsm aessigt
afslag_).

 



 

14.8 **Qualified Breach**

 



 

14.8.1 The limitations in this clause 14 do not apply to any Claim for a
Breach arising out of or as a result of fraud or wilful misconduct. In that
case, the general principles of Danish law will apply. The Sellers obligation
to indemnify the Buyer for such Claim(s) is only limited in the way that such
Claims together with all other Claims raised against the Sellers shall not
exceed, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate liability of each Seller under
this Agreement shall in no event exceed such Sellers part of the Purchase
Price, such as calculated by applying the Allocation Principles. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Buyer has been able to recover part of
the relevant Loss under the Insurance Policy, the Sellers shall not be liable
for the part of the Claim recovered under the Insurance Policy.

 



 

14.9 **Waivers and indemnities**

 



 

14.9.1 The Buyer hereby irrevocably waives - and agrees to procure that each
Group Company waives - any claim against any Person having served as member of
the executive management or the board of directors of a Group Company at any
time prior to Closing based on such Persons acts or omissions as board
members and members of other relevant corporate bodies of a Group Company.
Exempted from this discharge shall be any liability relating to any such
Persons, wilful misconduct or fraud and the Buyer shall not be obligated to
procure that each Group Company grants discharge if such,

 



      
 

 



 

wilful misconduct or fraud has been discovered prior to the date of the first
annual shareholders meeting following Closing.

 



 

14.9.2 The limitations on the Buyers right to pursue a Claim against the
Sellers and the Sellers Related Parties agreed in this Agreement (e.g. clause
14.3), shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Group Companies. Consequently, the
Buyer shall not be permitted to raise a claim against the Sellers or any of
the Sellers Related Parties indirectly through a Group Company if the Buyer
had been excluded from raising such claim directly. As such, the Buyer shall
procure that neither of the Group Companies puts forward such claims and the
Buyer undertakes to indemnify the Sellers against any Loss incurred by the
Sellers or any of the Sellers Related Parties arising out of any claim by a
Group Company against the Sellers or any of the Sellers Related Parties if
the Buyer is excluded from raising such claim against the Sellers under this
Agreement (excluding amounts owing on normal credit terms in the ordinary
course of business, which amounts remain outstanding until due).

 



 

14.9.3 If subsequent to Closing, the Sellers (or any of them) become aware
that a Seller or any Sellers Related Party remains obligated - whether
actually or potentially  under any guarantee or other agreement which relates
solely to the obligations of a Group Company, then the Buyer shall procure the
release of the relevant Seller(s) or its Related Parties from any such
obligation.

person or by a representative) on the board of directors of such listed
company.

 



 

15.2 Each of KB together with its ultimate owner Kristian Byrge, and B holding

Controlled by or Controlling such Seller or ultimate owner, actively seek to

15.3 If KB or its ultimate owner Kristian Byrge, or B Holding or its ultimate

business the " **New Business** "), the relevant of KB, its ultimate owner
Kristian Byrge, B Holding and/or Peter Bonnen (such Person the " **Notifying
Person** ") shall be entitled to provide a notice to the Buyer requesting the
Buyer to consider whether the New Business will in the Buyers view, if
undertaken by the Notifying Person, constitute a Competing Business. The Buyer
must no later than 15 Business Days after having received notice from the
Notifying Person provide its consent to or reject that the Notifying Person
undertakes the New Business. If the Buyer fails to inform the Notifying Person
of its consent or rejection within the stipulated timed period, a consent to
the Notifying Person undertaking the New Business shall be considered as
automatically granted. Any consent provided, irrespective of whether such
consent has been granted by the Buyer or by virtue of the Buyer failing to
provide notice in accordance with this clause 15.3, shall be binding and
irrevocable on the Buyer.

 



 

15.4 If KB or its ultimate owner Kristian Byrge, or B Holding or its ultimate
owner Peter Bonnen (such Person hereinafter a " **Non-Complying Person** ")
does not comply with clauses 15.1 and 15.2, the Buyer shall immediately send a
written notice thereof to the Non-Complying Person who shall immediately and
no later than five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the notice, if
relevant, remedy the non-compliance by ceasing the Competing Business.

 



 

15.5 In case a Non-Complying Person does not remedy its breach within five (5)
Business Days as set out in clause 15.3, and/or (ii) if the breach by its
nature cannot be remedied, the Non-Complying Person shall pay liquidated
damages (in Danish: " _konventionalbod_ ") to the Buyer in the amount of DKK
2,000,000 for each case of non-compliance. The payment of liquidated damages
will not cure the non-compliance, nor will it prevent the Buyer from claiming
any other rights under Danish law (or other applicable law). In case of any
non-compliance with clauses 15.1 and 15.2, the Buyer will further be entitled
to seek an injunction (in Danish " _fogedforbud_ ") before the ordinary courts
against the Non-Complying Person without having to put up any security
irrespective of the provision for arbitration.
