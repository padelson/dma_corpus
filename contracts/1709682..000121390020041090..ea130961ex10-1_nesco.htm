AGREEMENT

  



  

Section 1. _Contribution_.

  



  

1.1  _Contribution of the Rollover Interests in Exchange for the Exchange
Shares_. On the terms and conditions set forth herein, (a) Holder agrees, at
the Contribution Closing (as defined below) and substantially simultaneously
with the consummation of the Cash Equity Capitalization, to contribute to
Parent the Rollover Interests, free and clear of any and all Liens (other
than restrictions on the right to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares
imposed by state and federal securities laws or the Company LP Agreement), in
exchange for the issuance by Parent to Holder of the Exchange Shares and (b)
Parent agrees, at the Contribution Closing, to issue to Holder the Exchange
Shares in exchange for the contribution by Holder to Parent of the Rollover
Interests. Holder and Parent hereby agree that Holder shall be entitled to
receive any amounts payable after the Closing in respect of its Rollover
Interests under the Purchase Agreement as if the Contribution had not been
consummated and the Rollover Interests were held by Holder immediately prior
to the Closing. Immediately following the Contribution Closing and prior to
the Closing, Parent shall contribute the Rollover Interests to the capital of
Buyer as a capital contribution.

  



  

1.2  _Fractional Exchange Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Exchange Shares shall be issued upon consummation of the
Contribution, no dividend or distribution with respect to Exchange Shares
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of
a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of fractional Exchange Shares, if, in
exchange for its Rollover Interests, Holder is otherwise entitled to
receive a fractional Exchange Share pursuant to such exchange, Holder shall
instead receive, promptly following its receipt of the remainder of the
applicable Exchange Shares, a cash payment equal to (a) $5.00 multiplied by
(b) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which Holder was
otherwise entitled.

  



  

1.3  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Contribution Closing_ ") of the

Contribution Closing shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP
555 Eleventh Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004 or such other place
as agreed by Parent and Sellers' Representative.

  



  

1.4  _Failure to Close_. In the event that the Closing fails to be
consummated for any reason whatsoever and the Purchase Agreement is
terminated, the parties hereto agree that concurrently with the termination of
the Purchase Agreement, if the termination of the Purchase Agreement occurs
after consummation of the Contribution, (a) Parent shall return to Holder the
Rollover Interests and (b) Holder shall return to Parent the Exchange Shares
issued to Holder. In such event, Holder shall have no claim against Parent
under this Agreement other than the right to receive the Rollover Interests
upon return of the Exchange Shares, and Parent shall have no further
obligations to Holder under this Agreement.

  



  

1.5  _Conditions to Contribution Closing_. The consummation of the
Contribution shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions
unless waived in writing by Parent and Holder (in the case of clauses (a) and
(b)) or by Parent (in the case of clause (c)) or by Holder (in the case of
clause (d)):

  



  

(a)  _No Law_. No Law shall have been enacted, entered, issued or promulgated
(and remain in effect) by any Governmental Authority which prohibits

as of such date) (disregarding all qualifications as to "materiality,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as
of such date, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the
Investment Agreement). Parent shall have performed, satisfied and complied
with, in all material respects, all covenants, agreements and conditions
required by this Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by it
at or prior to the Contribution Closing.

power to assign or delegate any provision of this Agreement except with the
prior written consent of Parent and Sellers' Representative, in the case of an
assignment or delegation by Holder, or with the prior written consent of
Holder and Sellers' Representative, in the case of an assignment or

constitute one and the same document.

  



  

Section 12.   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and shall supersede (a) all prior oral or written
proposals, term sheets or agreements, (b) all contemporaneous oral proposals
or agreements and (c) all previous negotiations and all other communications

for the cash payments (if any) to be made under the Purchase Agreement with
respect to the Rollover Interests after the Closing (clauses (i) and (ii), the
" _Intended Tax Treatment_ "); and (b) file all tax returns in a manner
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment. Parent shall consult reasonably
and in good faith with Holder in connection with determining whether the

with respect to the Contribution, including any information with respect to
such Holder described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.351-3(b), if
applicable.

* For Blackstone Capital Partners VI-NQ L.P., Blackstone Family Investment Partnership VI-NQ ESC L.P., Blackstone Energy Partners NQ L.P., Blackstone Energy Family Investment Partnership NQ SMD L.P., and Blackstone Energy Family Investment Partnership NQ ESC L.P. the Contribution Amount contributed by each of the aforementioend entities shall be decreased (i) (in proportion to its relative ownership of the Interests) prior to Closing to account for any additional Sellers (other than the Fred M. Ross, Jr. Trust dated December 30, 2018 as may be amended) that elect to participate, for their pro rata share, in the Rollovers and (ii) to take into account the distributions of certain Rollover rights in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization, provided, however, that this sentence shall not operate to reduce any Contribution Amounts except to the extent separate Rollover Agreements are executed with Parent with respect to additional Contribution Amounts that, in the aggregate, equal the aggregate amount of the reductions in Contribution Amounts pursuant to this sentence. Sellers' Representative will provide a written notice to Parent at least two Business Days prior to Closing setting forth the final Contribution Amount to be contributed by each Rollover Holder, which shall not, in the aggregate, be more or less than $100,000,000 in the aggregate across all Rollover Holders at Closing without the Buyer's consent.

  



  

** For purposes hereof, "net worth" means the excess of total assets at fair
market value (and including property owned by a spouse) over
total liabilities. For this purpose, "net worth" excludes the value of
Holder's primary residence. The related amount of indebtedness secured by the
primary residence up to its fair market value shall also be excluded.
Indebtedness secured by the residence in excess of the value of the home
shall be considered a liability and deducted from the person's net worth.
In addition, any increase in indebtedness secured by the primary residence
that is incurred in the sixty (60) days prior to the date of this Agreement
must be subtracted as a liability, even if the total amount of indebtedness
does not exceed the value of the home.
