 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged following the Effective Time as a share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

   ##### 

  

    

Stock (such ratio of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock to shares of Levitt
Class A Common Stock being referred to as the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, holders of Levitt Class A Common Stock and Levitt Class B Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders, and Levitt Stock Certificates shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the consideration provided under this  _Article III_. 

  

 (e) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of BFC Class A Common Stock or Levitt Class A Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, division, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend or other distribution payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to the BFC Class A Common Stock or Levitt Class A Common Stock with a record date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted to provide the holders of Levitt Class A Common Stock the same economic effect as that contemplated by this Agreement if the reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, division, combination, exchange, dividend or other distribution had not taken place. 

  

 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, BFC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or such other bank or trust company designated by BFC and who is reasonably satisfactory to Levitt (the " _Exchange/Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of certificates representing the shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock (" _Levitt Stock Certificates_ ") for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange/Paying Agent, (1) certificates representing the shares of BFC Class A Common Stock (" _BFC Stock Certificates_ ") issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ above and (2) an estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and such BFC Stock Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest thereon), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange/Payment Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to this _Article III_ in exchange for outstanding Levitt Stock Certificates. The Exchange/Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange/Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange/Payment Fund, as directed by BFC. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to BFC. Any losses resulting from such investments shall be the sole responsibility of BFC and shall not in any way limit BFCs obligations to holders of Levitt Stock Certificates. 

  

 (b) Promptly, but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, BFC will instruct the Exchange/Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Levitt Class A Common Stock who has not previously surrendered his, her or its Levitt Stock Certificates (other than holders of any shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ or holders of Dissenting Shares): (1) a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to Levitt (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holders Levitt Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Levitt Stock Certificates to the Exchange/Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as to which BFC and Levitt may agree) and (2) instructions reasonably acceptable to Levitt for use in effecting the surrender of the Levitt Stock Certificates in exchange for BFC Stock Certificates and cash in lieu of 

   ##### 

  

    

fractional shares in accordance with this _Article III_ (collectively, the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "). 

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time and upon the surrender of a Levitt Stock Certificate for cancellation (or affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates reasonably acceptable to BFC and the Exchange/Paying Agent) to the Exchange/Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant thereto, the holder of such Levitt Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange/Paying Agent shall deliver in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal: (1) BFC Stock Certificates representing that number of whole shares of BFC Class A Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Levitt Stock Certificate in accordance with  _Section 3.1_ and (2) cash in lieu of fractional shares of BFC Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ (the shares of BFC Class A Common Stock and cash described in clauses (1) and (2) being collectively referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and the Levitt Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Levitt, a certificate evidencing the proper number of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock and/or cash may be issued and/or paid in accordance with this  _Article III_ to a transferee if the Levitt Stock Certificate evidencing such shares is presented to the Exchange/Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably acceptable to BFC and the Exchange/Paying Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Levitt Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on shares of BFC Class A Common Stock after the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) No certificates or scrip evidencing fractional shares of BFC Class A Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Levitt Stock Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of BFC. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock, upon surrender of a Levitt Stock Certificate for exchange pursuant to this _Section 3.2_, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded up to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (1) the average closing price of the BFC Class A Common Stock as quoted on the NYSE Arca for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day two (2) days prior to the day of the Effective Time by (2) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock then held of record by such holder). Any payment received by a holder of shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock with respect to fractional share interests is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately bargained for, consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if more than one Levitt Stock Certificate shall be surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock to be issued to such holder in exchange for the Levitt Stock Certificates which have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by all of the Levitt Stock Certificates surrendered for the account of such holder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) All shares of BFC Class A Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Levitt Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid, respectively, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock theretofore represented by such Levitt Stock Certificates. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange/Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Levitt Stock Certificates upon the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange/Paying Agent to BFC and any holders of Levitt Stock Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to BFC for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (g) None of BFC, Levitt, Merger Sub or the Exchange/Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of BFC Class A Common Stock or cash from the Exchange/Payment Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Levitt Stock Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date that is seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of BFC, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) BFC and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock such amounts as BFC or Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by BFC or Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by BFC or Merger Sub. 

  

 (i) If any Levitt Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Levitt Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by BFC, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as BFC may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Levitt Stock Certificate, the Exchange/Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Levitt Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration, pursuant to this _Article III_. 

  

 3.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Levitt or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock or Levitt Class B Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Levitt Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange/Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and, subject to the provisions of this _Article III_, exchanged or paid for as provided in this _Article III_, except as otherwise required by Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.4 _Levitt Options and Restricted Stock_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Levitt Option Plan shall be assumed by BFC and each Levitt Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by BFC and converted into an option to purchase shares of BFC Class A Common Stock in such number and at such exercise price as provided below and otherwise having the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent that such terms, conditions and restrictions may be altered in accordance with their terms or the terms of the applicable Levitt Option Plan as a result of the Merger contemplated hereby and except that all references to Levitt in each such Levitt Option shall be deemed to refer to BFC). All outstanding restricted stock awards issued under the Levitt Option Plan shall be converted into the right to receive restricted stock awards in the form of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock, to be adjusted as provided in _Section 3.4(b)_. 

  

 (b) The number of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock to be subject to the new option or award of restricted stock shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Levitt Class A Common Stock subject to the original Levitt Option or restricted stock award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (c) The exercise price per share of the BFC Class A Common Stock underlying the new option shall be equal to (i) the exercise price per share of Levitt Class A Common Stock in effect under the original Levitt Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. 

  

 (d) In effecting such assumption and conversion, the aggregate number of shares of BFC Class A Common Stock to be subject to each assumed Levitt Option or restricted stock award will be rounded up, if necessary, to the next whole share and the aggregate exercise price shall be rounded down, if necessary, to the next whole cent. 

  

 (e) The adjustments provided herein with respect to any options that are " _incentive stock options_ " (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, BFC shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of BFC Class A Common Stock underlying the assumed Levitt Options and restricted stock awards, and BFC will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any such assumed Levitt Options or restricted stock awards remain outstanding under the Levitt Option Plan to be assumed by BFC. 

  

 3.5 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share of Levitt Class A Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is owned by a shareholder who, pursuant to Section 607.1301, _et seq._ , of the FBCA duly and validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with respect to his, her or its shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be 

   ##### 

  

    

converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the Merger
Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof shall be entitled to payment
in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 607.1301, _et.
seq._ , of the FBCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly and validly
exercise or perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights, each share of Levitt Class A Common Stock of such holder
shall not be deemed a Dissenting Share and shall automatically be converted
into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

Each party shall (and, in the case of each of BFC or Levitt shall cause its Subsidiaries to) make their respective directors, management and other employees and agents and authorized representatives (including counsel and independent public accountants) available to confer with the other party, and its authorized representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable request, and each party shall disclose and make available to the other party and shall cause its agents and authorized representatives to disclose and make available to the other party, all books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities of such party (and, in the case of each of BFC or Levitt, its Subsidiaries).

Each party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, except as otherwise required by Law. 

  

 7.2 _Public Announcements_.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (a) the parties shall use their respective reasonable efforts in good faith to take or cause to be taken as promptly as practicable all reasonable actions that are within their control to cause to be fulfilled those conditions precedent to their obligations to consummate the Merger and (b) the parties shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 7.4 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of BFC, and subject to _Section 7.4(b)_ hereof, Levitt will not, and will not permit its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposals or any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposals, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to any Person in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or 

   ##### 

  

    

under circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise
endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal relating to a possible (1)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving Levitt or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) sale, lease,
exchange, transfer or other disposition (other than sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices), directly or

one or more transactions), of all or substantially all of the assets of
Levitt and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (3) liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction, or (4)
transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of
the foregoing transactions; provided, however, that the term " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall not include the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby or any proposal or modification thereof submitted by BFC or any of its
Affiliates (other than Levitt or any of its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers, employees or agents). Levitt will, and will direct all
its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.4(a)_ above, if a Person or group other than BFC or any of its Affiliates (other than Levitt or any of its Subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, employees or agents) (a " _Third Party_ ") after the date of this Agreement submits to Levitt or its Board of Directors, or the Special Committee, not resulting from a breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ above, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal, and the Special Committee or Levitts Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith, (i) after consultation with their financial, legal and other advisors that such Acquisition Proposal will result in, or upon further discussion with or due diligence by such Third Party could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the action set forth in (A) and (B) below may be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then, in such case Levitt may (A) furnish information about its business to the Third Party under protection of an appropriate confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to such Third Party, provided that Levitt contemporaneously furnishes to BFC all such non-public information furnished to the Third Party and (B) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party. In the event that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Levitt receives a Superior Proposal not in violation of _Section 7.4(a)_ and the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of Levitt determines, in good faith and after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors may do any or all of the following: (x) withhold, withdraw, modify or change the Board of Directors approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or (y) approve or recommend to the shareholders of Levitt the Superior Proposal. The Board of Directors shall not take the action described in clauses (x) or (y) above without providing BFC with at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice stating that the Board of Directors intends to take such actions and setting forth the information specified in  _Section 7.4(c)_ hereof with respect to any Superior Proposal which the Board of Directors intends to accept or recommend. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for consideration consisting of cash (not subject to a financing contingency) and/or securities, and otherwise on terms which the Special Committee 

   ##### 

  

    

or Levitts Board of Directors determines, after consultation with their
legal, financial and other advisors, are more favorable to the Minority
Shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger or other revised
proposal submitted by BFC prior such determination, taking into account the
ability of the Third Party to consummate the Superior Proposal on
substantially the terms proposed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit
Levitt from taking, and disclosing to its shareholders, a position required
by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) Levitt will notify BFC immediately, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, if (i) an Acquisition Proposal is made or is modified in any respect (including any written material provided by the offeror, the principal terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto and the identity of the offeror), in which case Levitt will provide a copy of the Acquisition Proposal concurrently with such notice or (ii) Levitt furnishes non-public information to, or enters into discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party. 

  

 (d) In addition to the obligations of Levitt set forth in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this  _Section 7.4_, Levitt, as promptly as practicable, will advise BFC orally and in writing of any request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request or inquiry. Levitt will keep BFC informed in all respects of the status of any such request or inquiry.

As appropriate, Levitts Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution to discontinue the sale or contribution (for any applicable period that has not yet commenced) of Levitt Common Stock pursuant to any Levitt Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code, or otherwise shall cause such discontinuance. 

  

 7.8 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director of Levitt (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of BFC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each a " _Claim_ "), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party based in whole or in 

   ##### 

  

    

part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of Levitt if such Claim pertains to any matter or
fact arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the Merger) regardless of whether such Claim is asserted
or claimed before, at or after the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), to the same extent provided for under the FBCA
in effect as of the date hereof and under the Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws of Levitt as in effect on the date hereof. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action
or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the same extent provided for under
the FBCA in effect on the date hereof and under the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of Levitt upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 7.8(a)_, upon learning of any Claim, shall immediately notify BFC
(but the failure so to notify BFC shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this  _Section 7.8(a)_ except to the extent such
failure prejudices BFC) and shall deliver to BFC any undertaking required by
applicable Law. The Surviving Corporation shall ensure, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, that all limitations of liability
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Levitt as in effect on the date hereof, or allowed
under applicable Law as in effect on the date hereof with respect
to Indemnified Liabilities, shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Levitt (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous, or in lieu thereof obtain single limit tail coverage providing at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous for such period (which shall be purchased by Levitt immediately prior to Closing upon the request of BFC)) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  _Section 7.8_ are intended to be enforceable against the Surviving Corporation directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and permitted assigns of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 7.9 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable on the part of such party, to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including obtaining all required consents, approvals, waivers, exemptions, amendments and authorizations, giving all notices, and making or effecting all filings, registrations, applications, designations and declarations, including, but not limited to, those described in the schedules to this Agreement, and each party shall cooperate fully with the other (including by providing any necessary information) with respect to the foregoing.

 7.10 _Tax Treatment_.

Letter pursuant to _Section 5.11_. Levitt shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Affiliate disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.11_ and
each other shareholder referred to above to execute and deliver an Affiliate
Letter to BFC on or before the date of mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 AFFILIATE LETTER 

   

___________, 2007 

   

BFC Financial Corporation 
 2100 West Cypress Creek Road 
 Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33309  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

    

 The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Levitt Corporation, a Florida corporation ("Levitt"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 30, 2007 (the "Merger Agreement") among Levitt, BFC Financial Corporation, a Florida corporation ("BFC"), and LEV Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC ("Merger Sub"), each share of Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value, of Levitt issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time set forth in the Merger Agreement (the "Levitt Class A Common Stock"), shall be automatically converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, 0.01 par value, of BFC (the "BFC Class A Common Stock") set forth in the Merger Agreement (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares), and Levitt will be merged with and into Merger Sub with Merger Sub to be the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger"). Terms capitalized but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will receive shares of BFC Class A Common Stock in exchange for shares owned by the undersigned of Levitt Class A Common Stock. 

  

 The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to BFC that, as of the first date the undersigned receives any BFC Class A Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

       | A.  |   | The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer
or other disposition of the BFC Class A Common Stock in violation of the 1933
Act or the Rules and Regulations.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | B.  |   | The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the
Merger Agreement and discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary,
with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for Levitt, the requirements of
such documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds
ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of BFC Class A Common Stock.  
      
    | C.  |   | The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of
BFC Class A Common Stock to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be
registered with the SEC under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on
Form S-4. The undersigned  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | has also been advised that, because, at the time the
Merger is submitted for a vote of the shareholders of Levitt, the undersigned
may be deemed an affiliate of Levitt, the undersigned may not sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of BFC Class A Common Stock issued to the undersigned in
the Merger unless such sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been
registered under the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145
promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion
of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
BFC, is otherwise exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | D.  |   | The undersigned understands that BFC is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the BFC
Class A Common Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under
the 1933 Act or to take any other action necessary in order to enable the
undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other disposition in compliance
with an exemption from such registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that BFC
shall use reasonable efforts to file timely with the SEC all filings
required to be filed by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  
      
    | E.  |   | The undersigned also understands that there will be
placed on the certificates for the BFC Class A Common Stock issued to the
undersigned, or on any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:  
   

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A LETTER AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND BFC FINANCIAL CORPORATION, A COPY
OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF BFC FINANCIAL
CORPORATION."

   

       | F.  |   | The undersigned also understands that, unless the
transfer by the undersigned of the undersigneds BFC Class A Common Stock has
been registered under the 1933 Act, or is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, BFC reserves the right to put the following legend on
the certificates issued to the undersigneds transferee:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE
HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION
THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE

    ##### 

  

     

ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

   

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F
above shall be promptly removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been
registered for sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act, or (ii) BFC has
received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to BFC, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the
undersigned from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by
Rule 145 under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

   

       | G.  |   | The undersigned further understands and agrees
that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
undersigned set forth herein are for the benefit of BFC and the Surviving
Corporation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and will be relied upon by
such corporations and their respective counsel.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | H.  |   | The undersigned understands and agrees that the
restrictions of this letter agreement shall apply to all shares of BFC Class
A Common Stock that are acquired by the undersigned in the Merger.  
   

  

 Execution of this letter shall not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of Levitt as described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
