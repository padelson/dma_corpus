          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 2, 2000 (this
"Agreement"), among PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Parent"),
BeverageCo, Inc., a New Jersey corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Quaker Oats Company, a New Jersey corporation
(the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein;

          WHEREAS, the combination of the Company and Parent shall be effected
by the terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below (the
"Merger");

          WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors
of the Company and Parent have approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each share of
common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.3), other than shares owned by the Company, will be
converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, par value 1 2/3
cents per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") as set forth in Section
1.7 and each Company Preferred Share (as defined in Section 1.7(d)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged in the
Merger for Parent preferred stock in accordance with Section 1.7(d);

          WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder; and

          WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company are entering into a Stock Option Agreement
dated as of the date of this Agreement in the form attached as Annex A (the
"Option Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company shall grant to Parent an
option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock at $95 per share, on the
terms and conditions set forth therein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



<PAGE>


                                   ARTICLE I

                      THE MERGER; CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS

          1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the New Jersey Business
Corporation Act (the "NJBCA"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

          1.2 Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in Article VI and the termination rights set forth in Article VII, the closing
of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the first Business Day after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date) set forth in Article VI, unless this Agreement has been
theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the
Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be
held at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, 100 Maiden Lane, New
York, New York, 10038, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

          1.3 Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, at the Closing the parties shall (i) file a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the NJBCA and (ii) make all other
filings or recordings required under the NJBCA. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
appropriate official of the State of New Jersey or at such subsequent time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective
Time").

          1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger will have the effects set forth in the NJBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

          1.5 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

          1.6 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


          1.7 Effect on Capital Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Shares, as defined in Section 1.7(c)), together
with the associated Company Rights, shall be converted into the right to
receive that number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5, the "Merger
Consideration") equal to the Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange Ratio" shall be
determined as follows and shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
7.1(i):

          (i) If the Parent Market Price is less than or equal to $45.6522, the
     Exchange Ratio shall equal 2.3; and

          (ii) If the Parent Market Price is greater than $45.6522, the
     Exchange Ratio shall equal a quotient (rounded to the nearest
     one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is $105, and the denominator
     of which is the Parent Market Price.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Market Price" shall mean the average
daily closing price per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Tape for the Random Trading
Days, "Random Trading Days" shall mean the ten trading days selected by lot out
of the thirty trading days ending on and including the Determination Date (with
the Random Trading Days selected by lot by Parent and the Company at 5:00 p.m.
New York time on the Determination Date), and "Determination Date" shall mean
the third NYSE trading day preceding the Closing Date.

          (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(together with the associated Company Rights) shall cease to be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except as provided herein or by law.

          (c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company
at the Effective Time (collectively, the "Cancelled Shares") shall, by virtue
of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and
retired and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

          (d) Each share of Company Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock
(the "Company Preferred Shares") that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be exchanged as of the Effective Time for
preferred stock of Parent in accordance with Section 8A of Exhibit B of the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Exchanged Preferred
Shares"), which in part provides that such Exchanged Preferred Shares shall
have, with respect to Parent, insofar as possible, the same rights as the
Company Preferred Shares had immediately prior to the Merger, and shall be
convertible into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common


                                      -3-
<PAGE>


Stock that would have been received if the Company Preferred Shares had been
converted immediately prior to the Effective Time.

          (e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          1.8 Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

          (a) Each Company Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.2(b)) that was
granted pursuant to Company Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section 3.2(b)),
other than the stock units described in Section 1.8(c), prior to the Effective
Time (whether or not vested) shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into
fully vested options (in accordance with the terms of such options) to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock Option"), and the per share
exercise price of such Parent Stock Option shall equal the exercise price of
the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by the Exchange Ratio. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Parent Stock Option shall equal the number of shares of
Company Common Stock to which the corresponding Company Stock Option was
subject immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share). Each such Parent Stock Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as in effect at the
Effective Time, including the expiration date of the option, as the related
Company Stock Option. At the Effective Time, (1) all references to the Company
in the Company Stock Option Plans and in the stock option agreements evidencing
the related Company Stock Options shall be deemed to refer to Parent and (2)
Parent shall assume all of the Company's obligations with respect to Company
Stock Options as so converted into Parent Stock Options. Promptly after the
Effective Time, to the extent necessary to provide for registration of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock Options, Parent shall file
a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be, or any
successor form, with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain such registration statement (or any
successor form), including the current status of any related prospectus or
prospectuses for so long as the Company Stock Options remain outstanding. On or
prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions necessary such
that grants of Company Stock Options are treated in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentences, including, but not limited to, precluding each
holder from receiving any cash payments in respect of such grants in connection
with the Merger.

          (b) Restricted shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to The
Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 1999 and The Company Long Term Incentive
Plan of 1990 which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become fully vested and free of restrictions as of the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms thereof. Each such award shall be converted, as of
the Effective Time, into a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares subject to the award and (2) the Exchange
Ratio; and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock as so determined shall
be delivered to


                                      -4-
<PAGE>


the holder of each such award as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions
necessary such that awards of restricted shares are treated in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentences, including, but not limited to, precluding
each holder from receiving any cash payments in respect of such awards, other
than with respect to fractional shares, in connection with the Merger.

          (c) Other Equity Interests. Each stock unit which is described in
Section 3.2(b) as a Company Stock Option and which is payable in shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Units") and which is outstanding at
the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute a number of stock units, each
of which shall constitute one share of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Stock
Units"), equal to the number of each such Company Stock Unit multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio. Such Parent Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Company Stock Units and shall be payable to the holders in
shares of Parent Common Stock at the same time as the Company Stock Units would
have been payable in shares of Company Common Stock. If the Company has any
other outstanding equity interests, such interests shall be converted into
interests to purchase Parent Company Stock in a manner consistent with Section
1.8(a) to the extent such interests resemble stock options and shall be
converted into Company Common Stock in a manner consistent with Section 1.8(b)
to the extent such interests resemble restricted stock; provided, however, no
such conversion shall be effected in a manner which might adversely affect
Parent's ability to account for the Merger on the "pooling-of-interests" method
of accounting under APB-16.

          1.9 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

          1.10 Associated Rights. References in Article I and Article II of
this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context
requires otherwise, the associated Company Rights.

          1.11 Dissenters' Rights.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Preferred Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are owned by shareholders who have properly
perfected their rights as dissenting shareholders within the meaning of Section
14A:11-2 of the NJBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive Exchanged Preferred Shares unless and until such shareholders
shall have failed to perfect their right of payment under applicable law, but,
instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares determined in accordance with Sections 14A:11-3 through
14A:11-11 of


                                      -5-
<PAGE>


the NJBCA. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right of dissent, each Company Preferred
Share held by such shareholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into the right to receive and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
Exchanged Preferred Shares in the manner provided for in Section 1.7(d).

          (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices of
dissent filed pursuant to Section 14A:11-2 of the NJBCA received by the
Company, withdrawals of demands for payment and any other instruments served in
connection with the exercise by shareholders of their dissenters' rights
pursuant to the NJBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to notices of dissent and
demands for payment under the NJBCA. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment with respect to any such
notice of dissent or demand for payment or (y) offer to settle or settle any
such notice of dissent or demand for payment.

          1.12 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company
at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE II

                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

          2.1 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company or a
subsidiary thereof, to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.7 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Parent agrees
to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and
any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and
certificates of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

          2.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than 5 days after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which
letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>


Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7 (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) if required, a
check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more shares of Parent
Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3, may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid as the Exchange Agent may require.

          2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.5, in each case
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

          2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares
of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article
II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock and associated Company Rights.

          2.5 No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. (a) No certificates
or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a shareholder of Parent or a holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common
Stock multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the date of the Effective Time or,
if such date is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately following the
date on which the Effective Time occurs. Such payment of cash consideration in
lieu of fractional shares is not expected to exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of
the total Merger Consideration.

          (c) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.

          2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction
of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 1.7 and Section 2.2, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3. Any such portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock five years after the Effective Time or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(iii)) shall,
to the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

          2.7 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

          2.8 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
provided that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
the Company shareholders pursuant to Article I and the other provisions of this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
promptly be paid to Parent.


                                      -8-

          2.9 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

          2.10 Withholding Rights. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation
and Parent are required or entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law, the amounts so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be.

          2.11 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as
a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

          2.12 Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter
on the records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall, subject to
compliance with the provisions of this Article II by the holder thereof, be
converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5) and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

          2.13 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company in accordance with Section 5.12 hereof for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), or for purposes of qualifying the Merger for "pooling-of-interests"
accounting treatment under the requirements of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and the related published
interpretations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
Financial

Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or its staff ("APB-16") until
such Person has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.12) to Parent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          3.1 Representations and Warranties of Parent. Except as set forth in
the Parent disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant), Parent represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

          (i) Each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in
     Section 8.11) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
     under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has
     the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
     and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
     failures to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
     power and authority, in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Parent, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do
     business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
     ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary
     other than in such jurisdictions where the failures so to qualify or to be
     in good standing, in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Parent. The copies of the restated articles of incorporation and
     bylaws of Parent which were previously furnished or made available to the
     Company are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in
     effect on the date of this Agreement.

          (ii) Section 3.1(a)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth
     all the Subsidiaries of Parent which as of the date of this Agreement are
     Significant Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
     or other equity interests in, each such Significant Subsidiary have been
     validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are, except as
     set forth in Section 3.1(a)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, owned
     directly or indirectly by Parent, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
     liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
     whatsoever (collectively "Liens") and free of any other restriction
     (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
     of such capital stock or other ownership interests), except for
     restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Except as set forth in
     the Parent SEC Reports (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) filed prior to the
     date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or
     indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
     convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation,
     partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity (other
     than Subsidiaries), that is material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken
     as a whole.

          (b) Capital Structure.

          (i) As of November 24, 2000, the authorized capital stock of Parent
     consisted of (A) 3,600,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock of which
     1,447,514,539 shares were outstanding and 278,650,685 shares were held in
     the treasury of Parent. Since November 24, 2000 to the date of this
     Agreement, there have been no issuances of shares of the capital stock of
     Parent or any other securities of Parent other than issuances of shares
     pursuant to options or rights outstanding as of November 24, 2000 under
     the Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 8.11(b)) of Parent. All issued
     and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Parent are, and when shares
     of Parent Common Stock are issued in the Merger or in connection with
     stock options or restricted stock converted in the Merger pursuant to
     Section 1.8, such shares will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
     paid and non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights. When shares of
     Parent preferred stock are issued in the Merger in accordance with Section
     1.7(d), such shares will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
     and non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights. There were
     outstanding as of November 24, 2000 no options, warrants or other rights
     to acquire capital stock from Parent other than options to acquire capital
     stock from Parent representing in the aggregate the right to purchase
     approximately 148,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, the
     "Parent Stock Options") under the PepsiCo, Inc. 1994 Long-Term Incentive
     Plan, the PepsiCo, Inc. 1987 Incentive Plan, the PepsiCo, Inc. 1995 Stock
     Option Incentive Plan, the PepsiCo, Inc. 1988 Director Stock Plan and the
     PepsiCo SharePower Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Parent Stock
     Option Plans"). Except for options granted under the Parent Stock Option
     Plans, no options or warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock
     from Parent have been issued or granted since December 25, 1999 to the
     date of this Agreement.

          (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent
     having the right to vote on any matters on which holders of capital stock
     of Parent may vote ("Parent Voting Debt") are issued or outstanding.

          (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.1(b) and as
     contemplated by Section 1.7 and Section 1.8, as of the date of this
     Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights,
     commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which
     Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is
     bound obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
     sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
     capital stock or other voting securities of Parent or any of its
     Significant Subsidiaries or obligating Parent or any of its Significant
     Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security,
     option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
     undertaking. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
     obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
     otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
     Significant Subsidiaries.

          (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

          (i) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
     into this Agreement and the Option Agreement and to consummate the
     transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, subject in the case of the
     consummation of the Merger to the adoption of this Agreement and to
     obtaining the requisite shareholder approval (the "Parent Shareholder
     Approval") of an amendment to Parent's restated articles of incorporation
     to provide for the authorization of the Exchanged Preferred Shares to be
     issued solely in the Merger and of the issuance of the shares of Parent
     Common Stock and the Exchanged Preferred Shares to be issued in the Merger
     (such amendment and issuance, collectively the "Share Issuance") by the
     Required Parent Vote (as defined in Section 3.1(g)). The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement and the Option Agreement and the consummation
     of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
     authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent,
     subject to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval. Each of this
     Agreement and the Option Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
     Parent and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent,
     enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
     enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
     moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally
     or by general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability
     is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

          (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
     Agreement by Parent does not or will not, as the case may be, and the
     consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated hereby and by the Option Agreement will not, conflict with,
     or result in any violation of, or constitute a default (with or without
     notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or
     result by its terms in the, termination, amendment, cancellation or
     acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or
     the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other
     encumbrance on, or the loss of, any assets, including Intellectual
     Property (any such conflict, violation, default, right of termination,
     amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a "Violation")
     pursuant to: (A) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
     bylaws of Parent or any Significant Subsidiary of Parent, or (B) except
     as, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
     in Section 8.11(h)) on Parent, subject to obtaining or making the
     consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
     and filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any loan or credit
     agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit plan or other
     agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license,
     judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
     applicable to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or their respective
     properties or assets.

          (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
     registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, municipal,
     local or foreign government, any instrumentality, subdivision, court,
     administrative agency or commission or other authority thereof, or any
     quasi-governmental or private body exercising any regulatory, taxing,
     importing or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a
     "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect to


                                     -12-
<PAGE>


     Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in connection with the execution and
     delivery of this Agreement or the Option Agreement by Parent or the
     consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
     or by the Option Agreement, except for those required under or in relation
     to (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
     amended (the "HSR Act") and the EC Merger Regulation, (B) state securities
     or "blue sky" laws (the "Blue Sky Laws"), (C) the Securities Act, (D) the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (E) the
     NJBCA with respect to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, (F) rules
     and regulations of the NYSE, (G) antitrust or other competition laws of
     other jurisdictions, (H) the North Carolina Business Corporation Act with
     respect to the amendment of Parent's restated articles of incorporation
     described in Section 3.1(c)(i) and (I) such consents, approvals, orders,
     authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failures of
     which to make or obtain, in the aggregate, will not have a Material
     Adverse Effect on Parent. Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
     registrations, declarations and filings required under or in relation to
     any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are hereinafter referred to
     as "Necessary Consents."

          (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

          (i) Parent has filed all required registration statements,
     prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
     required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 1998
     (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Parent SEC Reports").
     No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any form, report, registration
     statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC. None of the Parent
     SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if amended or superseded
     by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, then
     on the date of such filing), contained or will contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material
     fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
     therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading. Each of the financial statements (including the related notes)
     included in the Parent SEC Reports presents fairly, in all material
     respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of
     operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
     of the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth therein,
     all in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
     principles ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved
     except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of the
     unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal
     year-end adjustments that have not been and are not expected to be
     material in amount. All of such Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective
     dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective Parent SEC
     Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
     requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
     regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (ii) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the
     date hereof, since December 25, 1999, Parent and its Subsidiaries have not
     incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be
     disclosed on a balance sheet of Parent and its


                                     -13-
<PAGE>


     Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP,
     other than (A) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or
     (B) liabilities that, in the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Parent.

          (e) Information Supplied.

          (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for
     inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 (as defined in
     Section 5.1) will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any
     time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
     under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
     or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (B) the Joint
     Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 5.1) will, on the date
     it is first mailed to the Company shareholders or Parent shareholders or
     at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders
     Meeting (each as defined in Section 5.1), contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Form S-4
     and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all
     material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
     Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

          (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(e),
     no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements
     made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by the Company for
     inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

          (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Parent, by resolutions
duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held and not
subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "Parent Board Approval"),
has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and
are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders, (ii)
approved this Agreement, the Option Agreement, the Merger and the Share
Issuance and (iii) recommended that the shareholders of Parent approve the
Share Issuance and directed that the Share Issuance be submitted for
consideration by Parent's shareholders at the Parent Shareholders Meeting.

          (g) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock is the only vote necessary to
approve the Share Issuance (the "Required Parent Vote").

          (h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

          (i) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the
     date of this Agreement, there are no suits, actions or proceedings
     (collectively "Actions") pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, seriously
     threatened, against or affecting Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent which,
     in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, nor are
     there any judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of any
     Governmental Entity or


                                     -14-
<PAGE>


     arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent which,
     in the aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (ii) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the
     date of this Agreement and except as will, in the aggregate, not have a
     Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all
     permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all
     Governmental Entities which are necessary for the operation of the
     businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Parent
     Permits"). Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
     the Parent Permits, except where the failures to so comply, in the
     aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as
     disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
     Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of,
     and Parent and its Subsidiaries have not received any notices of
     violations with respect to, any laws, ordinances or regulations of any
     Governmental Entity, except for violations which, in the aggregate, will
     not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

          (i) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except (i) for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, and (iii) as permitted by Section 4.1, since December 25, 1999,

Independent Accountants") dated approximately the date the Form S-4 is declared
effective and addressed to Parent in which Parent's Independent Accountants
will concur with Parent's management's conclusion that no conditions exist
related to Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would
preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger as a "pooling-of-interests"
(except for actions, facts or circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(n) of the

subject to the receipt by Parent of (i) a letter to the Company's Independent
Accountants from the Company, dated approximately the date the Form S-4 is

company" that is eligible to participate in a business combination to be
accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests" under APB-16, and (ii) a letter to
the Company from Arthur Andersen LLP (the "Company's Independent Accountants")

obtained) and has paid when due all Taxes required to have been paid by it,
(ii) there is no audit, action, suit or proceeding now pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, seriously threatened against or with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in respect of Taxes and (iii) to the knowledge of

imposed on any other Person, except as the result of the application of Treas.
Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
law) to the affiliated group of which Parent is the common parent. For purposes
of this Agreement: (i) "Tax" (and,

Reports, there are no Benefit Plans maintained by Parent covering only Parent
executive officers. With respect to Parent, each Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in accordance with its terms and applicable law, except where
failure to do so will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger will not
constitute an event under any Parent Benefit Plan that will or may result in
any payment, acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in compensation or benefits or obligation to fund benefits with
respect to any Parent employee which, in the aggregate, have had, or will have,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful
expenditures relating to political activity to government officials, candidates

Effect on Parent.

          3.2 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule")

follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>


     properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except
     where the failures to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
     have such power and authority, in the aggregate, will not have a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Company, and is duly qualified and in good standing
     to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
     the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
     necessary other than in such jurisdictions where the failures so to
     qualify or to be in good standing in the aggregate will not have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the certificate of
     incorporation and bylaws of the Company which were previously furnished or
     made available to Parent are true, complete and correct copies of such
     documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

     been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are, except
     as set forth in Section 3.2(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
     owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all Liens
     and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right
     to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
     ownership interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable
     securities laws. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports (as
     defined in Section 3.2(d)) filed prior to the date hereof, neither the
     Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity
     or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
     or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
     business association or entity (other than Subsidiaries), that is or will

<PAGE>


     agreement of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its
     terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or
     affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles (regardless
     of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or

          (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
     Agreement by the Company does not or will not, as the case may be, and the

     agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license,

          (i) The Company has filed all required registration statements,
     prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents

     (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC Reports").
     No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report,

     Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained or will contain
     any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a
     material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
     statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

     the unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and
     normal and recurring year-end adjustments that have not been and are not
     expected to be material in amount. All of such Company SEC Reports, as of
     their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the
     respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material
     respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
     Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

     the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
     supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
     contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
     material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
     statements therein not misleading, and (B) the Joint Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to the Company
     shareholders or Parent shareholders or at the time of the Company
     Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders Meeting, contain any
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading. The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
     comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
     Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
     SEC thereunder.

          (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2(e),
     no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
     statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint
     Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by Parent or
     Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

          (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of the Company, by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held

          (h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

          (i) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the

Accountants, dated approximately the date the Form S-4 is declared effective

SEC) or (ii) any non-competition agreements or any other agreements or
arrangements that limit or otherwise restrict the Company or any of its

restrict Company or any of its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
or any successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business or
in any geographic area, which agreements or arrangements, in the aggregate,
will have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries), taken together, after giving effect to the
Merger.

          (q) Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in the Company
SEC Reports, since December 31, 1999, the Company has not entered into any

          (i) Section 3.2(r) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
correct and complete list identifying each material Benefit Plan. Copies of

liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination
of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously

          (iv) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter and to the
knowledge of the Company no fact or circumstance exists giving rise to a
material likelihood that such Plan would not be treated as so qualified by the
Internal Revenue Service. Each Benefit Plan has been maintained in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and
the Code, which are applicable to such Benefit Plan.

          (v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Benefit Plan. There is no contract, plan or
arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,

to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms
of Section 280G of the Code.

          (vi) There has been no adoption of any new Benefit Plan nor any
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written)
by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Benefit Plan above the level of the
expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999.

          (vii) There is no material action, suit, investigation, audit or
proceeding pending against or involving or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or involving, any Benefit Plan before any court or
arbitrator or any state, federal or local governmental body, agency or
official.

maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations
(including any funding requirement or special provisions relating to qualified
plans where such international benefit plan was intended to qualify) and has
been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. There
has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or
not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change

          (h) Pooling; Tax-Free Qualification. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action or fail to take any action
(including any action otherwise permitted by this Section 4.2) that would
prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "pooling-of-interests" under
APB-16 or as a "reorganization" under Section 368 of the Code.

          (i) Compensation and Benefits. Except (i) as contemplated by Section
4.2(c) or 5.5 or by Section 4.2(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as
required by law or the terms of any existing Benefit Plan or other agreement,
or (iii) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, the
Company shall not increase the amount of compensation of any director,
executive officer or employee, make any increase in or commitment to increase
any employee benefits, issue any additional Company Stock Options, adopt or
make any commitment to adopt any additional employee benefit plan or make any
contribution, other than regularly scheduled contributions, to any Company
Benefit Plan.

          (j) Accounting Methods; Income Tax Elections. Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or as
required by a Governmental Entity, the Company shall not change its methods of
accounting in effect at December 31, 1999, except as required by changes in
GAAP as concurred in by the Company's independent public accountants. The
Company shall not (i) change its fiscal year or (ii) make any material tax
election, other than in the ordinary course of business. Following consultation
in good faith between the Company and Parent, the Company will prepare and
submit to the applicable Tax authorities such filings, schedules and other
related materials and take such other actions as are reasonably requested by
Parent with respect to any Tax asset or benefit of the Company or any
Subsidiary in excess of $150 million.

          (k) Certain Agreements. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreements or arrangements that
limit or otherwise restrict the


                                     -32-
<PAGE>


Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any
successor thereto, or that could, after the Effective Time, limit or restrict
Parent or any of its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) or any
successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business or in any
geographic area which agreements or arrangements, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), taken together, after giving
effect to the Merger.

          (l) Representations and Warranties. The Company shall not take any
action that would cause any of its representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.2 (other than Section 3.2(n) if Parent waives the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2(e)) to be no longer true and correct.

          (m) No Related Actions. The Company will not, and will not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, authorize, commit or agree to take any action that is
inconsistent with any of the foregoing actions.

          4.3 Governmental Filings. The Company and Parent shall file all
reports required to be filed by each of them with the SEC (and all other
Governmental Entities) between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time and shall (to the extent permitted by law or regulation or any applicable
confidentiality agreement) deliver to the other party copies of all such
reports, announcements and publications promptly after the same are filed. Each
party shall (a) confer on a regular and frequent basis with the other and (b)
report to the other (to the extent permitted by law or regulation or any
applicable confidentiality agreement) on operational matters.

          4.4 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct Parent's operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its respective operations.

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          5.1 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meetings. (a) As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials
which shall constitute the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (such proxy
statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Parent shall prepare and file a registration
statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger (the "Form S-4"). The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4 as Parent's prospectus.
The Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable


                                     -33-
<PAGE>


best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the
Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any
written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with respect
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from the SEC. Parent will
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and
will provide the Company with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both
parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided
that, with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of
approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations; and
provided, further, that Parent, in connection with a Change in the Parent
Recommendation, and the Company, in connection with a Change in the Company
Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying
Amendment (as defined below) to effect such a Change, and in such event, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, and
shall be subject to the right of each party to have its Board of Directors'
deliberations and conclusions to be accurately described. A "Qualifying
Amendment" means an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) to
the extent it contains (i) a Change in the Parent Recommendation or a Change in
the Company Recommendation (as the case may be), (ii) a statement of the
reasons of the Board of Directors of Parent or the Company (as the case may be)
for making such Change in the Parent Recommendation or Change in the Company
Recommendation (as the case may be) and (iii) additional information reasonably
related to the foregoing. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statements/Prospectus to be mailed to Parent shareholders, and the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company's shareholders, in each case
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act at such time
as reasonably agreed on by the Parties. Parent shall also take any action
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the Share Issuance and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party will advise
the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the


                                     -34-
<PAGE>


other party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of Parent and
the Company.

          (b) The Company shall duly take (subject to compliance with the
provisions of Section 3.1(e) and Section 3.2(e) (provided that the Company
shall have used reasonable best efforts to ensure that such representations are
true and correct)) all lawful action to call, give written notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders pursuant to and in compliance with
Section 14A:10-3 of the NJBCA on a date as soon as reasonably practicable (the
"Company Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required
Company Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by
the Required Company Vote; and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company to the
effect as set forth in Section 3.2(f) (the "Company Recommendation"), and shall
not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) (a
"Change") in any manner adverse to Parent such recommendation or take any
action or make any statement in connection with the Company Shareholders
Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the
Company Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate
disclosure (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the
Company Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent or the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (provided that the
Board of Directors of the Company does not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation) in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
otherwise, to the extent such information, facts, identity or terms is required
to be disclosed under applicable law; and, provided, further, that the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation
pursuant to Section 5.4 hereof. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the
Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving this
Agreement and the Merger; provided that this Agreement shall not be required to
be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.

          (c) Parent shall duly take (subject to compliance with the provisions
of Section 3.2(e) and Section 3.1(e) (provided that Parent shall have used
reasonable best efforts to ensure that such representation is true and
correct)) all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders on a date as soon as reasonably practicable (the "Parent
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Parent Vote
and shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement and
the Share Issuance by the Required Parent Vote, including proposing approval of
the charter amendment and the issuance of Parent Common Stock and Exchanged
Preferred Shares constituting the Share Issuance together in the same item to
be voted on by Parent's shareholders, and the Board of Directors of Parent
shall recommend the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Share
Issuance by the shareholders of Parent to the effect as


                                     -35-
<PAGE>


set forth in Section 3.1(f) (the "Parent Recommendation"), and shall not Change
in any manner adverse to the Company such recommendation or take any action or
make any statement in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Parent
Recommendation"); provided the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure
(and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Parent
Recommendation) of factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or operations of Parent or the Company in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the extent such information, facts,
identity or terms is required to be disclosed under applicable law.
Notwithstanding any Change in the Parent Recommendation, this Agreement and a
proposal to approve the Share Issuance shall be submitted to the shareholders
of Parent at the Parent Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Parent Shareholder Approval; provided that this Agreement shall not be required
to be submitted to the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholders
Meeting if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a recommendation
by the Company Board of Directors of a third party Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company.

          5.2 Access to Information/Employees. (a) Upon reasonable notice, each
party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of the other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such period, such
party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other
party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed, published, announced or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, as applicable
(other than documents which such party is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law), and (b) all other information concerning it and its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request (including
consultation on a regular basis with respect to litigation matters); provided,
however, that either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
(i) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable
to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information, (ii) the information is subject
to confidentiality obligations to a third party or (iii) the information is of
the type described in Section 5.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any such
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2 will be considered
"Information" pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. Any investigation by
Parent or the Company shall not affect the representation and warranties of the
Company and Parent, as the case may be.

          (b) After the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall establish a
mechanism reasonably acceptable to both parties by which Parent will be
permitted, prior to the Effective Time and subject to applicable law, to
communicate directly with the Company employees regarding employee related
matters after the Effective Time.

          5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

          (a) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, tax rulings and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all steps as
may be necessary to obtain all such consents, waivers, licenses, registrations,
permits, authorizations, tax rulings, orders and approvals. Parent shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or
that could reasonably be expected to result in (i) any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or (ii) a material delay in
the satisfaction of such conditions.

          (b) The Company shall, cooperate with and assist Parent, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including, without
limitation, preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain
and maintain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third party that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. At Parent's request, the Company will commit to
and implement any divestiture, hold separate or similar transaction or action
with respect to any asset or business of the Company, which commitment and
implementation may, at the Company's option, be conditioned upon and effective
as of the Effective Time. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in (i) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VI not being satisfied or (ii) a material delay in the satisfaction of
such conditions.

          (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law (as defined below) with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and any other Regulatory Law and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act as soon as practicable.

          (d) In connection with this Section 5.3 the parties agree to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other
party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party


                                     -37-
<PAGE>


to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the
extent appropriate or permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, Council
Regulation No. 4064/89 of the European Community, as amended (the "EC Merger
Regulation") the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and foreign, if any,
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate (i) foreign investment or (ii) actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition. It is the
intention of the Parties to consummate the Merger promptly upon (i) expiration
of the HSR waiting period or obtaining approval of the DOJ or FTC as necessary
and (ii) obtaining any necessary approval under the EC Merger Regulation (the
"Material Regulatory Consents"). Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require the obtaining of any other consent or approval under any other
Regulatory Law or otherwise as a condition to the Merger.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to dispose of or
hold separate, or agree to dispose of or hold separate or restrict its
ownership and operation of, all or any portion of the business or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, except that Parent
shall be required, if necessary to obtain any regulatory approval from any
Governmental Entity necessary for consummation of the Merger, to divest its ALL
SPORT beverage brand, without regard to consideration received, no later than
the date which is 30 days prior to the date eight months from the date hereof.

          5.4 Acquisition Proposals. (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall, and that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
initiate or solicit any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, or
any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including
without limitation stock of Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for,
20% or more of the equity securities of the Company (any such proposal or offer
(other than a proposal or offer made by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates) being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). The
Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers


                                     -38-
<PAGE>


and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that
the Company may waive any provision in such standstill or similar agreement
which has the effect of prohibiting direct communication relating to a proposal
between such third party and the Company's Board of Directors or executive
officers, and provided, further, that such waiver or release was made without
prior solicitation or negotiation by the Company or its directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company or its Board of Directors shall be
permitted to (1) at any time prior to the time at which the Company's
Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained, engage in discussions or
negotiations with a third party who seeks, without prior solicitation by or
negotiation with the Company or its directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives, to initiate such discussions or negotiations and may furnish
such third party information concerning the Company and its business,
properties, and assets if, and only to the extent that (A) the Board of
Directors has determined, in their reasonable judgment, that such discussions
may reasonably lead to a Superior Proposal, and (B) prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions with, such third party, the
Company receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms customary in transactions of such nature and the Company
promptly notifies Parent of its intention to provide information to a third
party; and (2) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal. Except as set forth below,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof may (i)
effect a Change in the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or
propose publicly to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the time at which the Company Shareholders Approval has been obtained, in
response to an Acquisition Proposal from a third party, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof may, subject to payment of the Company Termination Fee set forth in
Section 7.2(b) if and when applicable: (i) enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) effect a Change of the
Company Recommendation and approve or recommend such Acquisition Proposal, but
in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if the
Company notifies Parent, in writing and at least 72 hours prior to taking any
such action, promptly of its intention to take such action, specifying the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and identifying the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, and Parent does not make, within 72 hours of receipt
of such written notification, an offer that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Acquisition Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not enter into
any binding agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal prior to the
expiration of such 72-hour period.


                                     -39-
<PAGE>


          (b) In addition to the notification required under the final sentence
of Section 5.4(a), the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of
any inquiry relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal and the terms of
such proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the person and its
affiliates making the same, that it may receive in respect of any such
transaction, and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis with respect to
any significant developments with respect to the foregoing. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the advisors, employees and other agents
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company
to return or destroy all such information.

          5.5 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From and after the Effective Time
until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to comply with all severance arrangements, plans or
agreements in effect at the Company at the Effective Time for hourly employees.
From and after the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either maintain
the Company's compensation levels and Company Benefit Plans or provide
compensation and employee benefits under Benefit Plans to the employees and
former employees of the Company and its respective Subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided
to such persons pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided however, that for employees who are
participants in the Company's leveraged employee stock ownership plan ("LESOP")
on the date hereof, the aggregate compensation and benefits in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be determined assuming an
allocation for the LESOP and related excess cash payments equal to 15% of
compensation (as compensation is determined in accordance with the Company's
historical practices) with respect to the LESOP participants in the aggregate.
Service with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be credited as service
under Parent's Benefit Plans to the extent that such credit does not result in
duplication of benefits. Parent shall honor or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor any retention program, each employment agreement, the
Company's Officers Severance Program, Severance Pay Plan, and Salaried
Employees Compensation and Benefits Protection Plan, each executive separation
agreement and other severance plans or programs (of which any material
severance plan or program has been disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule) in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
their terms, provided that, subject to the requirements of the first two
sentences of this Section 5.5, nothing herein shall prevent Parent from
terminating or reducing benefits under those arrangements to the extent
permissible under the terms of such agreements, programs or plans. In the event
that any of the Company's Benefit Plans (to the extent disclosed to Parent on
the date hereof and subject to Section 5.5(b)) prohibit termination or
modification in the event of a Change in Control, Parent agrees to and to cause
the Surviving Corporation to abide by the terms thereof. Parent acknowledges
that shareholder approval of the Merger shall constitute a "Change in Control"
for purposes of the Company's Benefit Plans to the extent consistent with the
terms of such Company Benefit Plans. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 45 days, Parent shall pay or shall
cause the


                                     -40-
<PAGE>


Surviving Corporation to pay to eligible plan participants and to each employee
covered by one of the Company's bonus plans for 2001, who in either case is
also an employee of the Company at the Effective Time, a cash bonus for the
employee's service for such period from January 1, 2001 through the Effective
Time. The amount of cash bonus for each employee shall be an amount equal to
the product of (i) the employee's 2001 target bonus as adjusted to reflect
actual performance through the Effective Time as determined by the Company's
Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the quotient
of (A) the number of weeks between January 1, 2001 and the Effective Time
divided by (B) 52. Parent shall not take any action which would reduce the
allocations which would otherwise be made under the LESOP feature of the
Company's 401(K) Plan for Salaried Employees for the plan year ending June 30,
2001 to employees who are participants in that plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause Dividend
Replacement Contributions (as defined under the LESOP) to be made to such plan
for the June 30, 2001 plan year consistent with the Company's historical
practices, and shall not permit any action which would extend participation to
any groups of employees who are not participants in the LESOP immediately prior
to the Effective Time. To the extent that LESOP allocations to any participants
for such plan year are limited by reason of any provision of the plan or the
Code, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make corresponding cash
payments to such participants in accordance with the Company's historical
practices. From and after the Effective Time until the six month anniversary
thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide at least 30
days notice prior to terminating, for reasons other than cause, any Company
Employee whose options will terminate on the last day of employment.

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) cause the
Company's Benefits Protection Trust to be terminated in accordance with the
terms thereof such that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not
trigger or otherwise result in any funding of the Benefits Protection Trust;
(ii) cause the Company's Retirement Plan to be amended to delete paragraph
14.1(b) thereof and to provide that, in the event of a merger of the Retirement
Plan, paragraph 14.1(c) thereof will apply only if the successor plan is
terminated and (iii) cause the Company's Salaried Employees Compensation and
Benefits Protection Plan and Officers Severance Pay Program to be amended to
allow each to be amended or terminated at any time following the second
anniversary of the Effective Time; provided that no such amendment or
termination shall adversely affect the rights of any participant whose
employment is terminated prior to such second anniversary.

          (c) The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors
will not exercise its discretion under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan
for Executives to accelerate payout of deferred compensation credited in the
form of stock units in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except to the
extent contractually required with respect to an individual's contract that is
in place on the date hereof, (i) make any grant of options for the year 2001
under any Company Stock Option Plan, or (ii) make any grant of matching
restricted stock under the Company's Incentive Investment Program, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be withheld or
conditioned by Parent in its sole discretion.

Corporation or its relevant Subsidiary shall pay, or cause to be paid, any and
all property or transfer taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(b) Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" includes all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party
hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection
with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of shareholder approvals and all

          5.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b)
without limitation to clause (a), to the fullest extent permitted by law, in
each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporation's (or any successor's) certificate of incorporation and bylaws for
a period of six years after the Effective Time, the current provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and (iii) cause to be
maintained for a period of six years after the Effective Time officers' and
directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time covering such persons currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof, provided that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section
5.7, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess
of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year.
The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.7 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 5.7 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.7). Without limiting any of the obligations above, nothing in this Section
5.7 shall be construed to make Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
a co-insurer with any third-party provider of directors' and officers'
liability insurance.

required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement

to be delivered to the Company a copy of a letter from Parent's Independent

stating that they concur with Parent's conclusion that (i) as of the date of

party to a business combination to be accounted for as a
"pooling-of-interests", except for such actions, facts or circumstances that
will be corrected or cured prior to the Closing Date and (ii) assuming such
correction or cure, the combination of Parent and the Company as contemplated
by this Agreement will be treated as a "pooling-of-interests" under APB-16.

Parent a copy of a letter from the Company's Independent Accountants, addressed

in the judgment of the Company, may be deemed at the time this Agreement is
submitted for approval by the shareholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or for purposes of
qualifying the Merger for "pooling-of-interests" accounting treatment under
APB-16, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the

efforts to cause each person identified on such list to deliver to the Company
not less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement
including the substance of paragraphs 1(B) and 2 of Exhibit 5.12 hereto.

<PAGE>


right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before the Termination Date;

          (c) By either the Company or Parent, if the DOJ, FTC or European
Commission (i) shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable or (ii) shall have
failed to issue an order, decree or ruling with respect to a Material
Regulatory Consent or to take any other action, in the case of each of (i) and
(ii) which is necessary to fulfill the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c),
and such denial of a request to issue such order, decree, ruling with respect
to a Material Regulatory Consent or take such other action shall have become
final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to comply with Section 5.3 has been the cause of such action or
inaction;

          (d) By either the Company or Parent, if the approvals of the
shareholders of either Parent or the Company contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required
vote at a duly held meeting of shareholders or of any adjournment thereof at
which the vote was taken;

          (e) By Parent, if the Company shall have failed to make the Company
Recommendation or effected a Change in the Company Recommendation (or resolved
to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, or
shall have materially breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason
of a failure to call the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 5.1(b);

          (f) By the Company, if Parent shall have failed to make the Parent

to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, or
shall have materially breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason

5.1(c);

          (g) By either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been a
breach by the other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b)
(in the case of a breach by the Company) or Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b)
(in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub), and in any such case such

not have been cured within 45 days after written notice thereof shall have been
received by the party alleged to be in breach;

          (h) By either Parent or the Company, if the Board of Directors of the
Company authorizes the Company to enter into a written agreement concerning a
transaction that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is a
Superior Proposal;

          (i) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.1(i) by the
Company, if (A) its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote, at any
time during the 24-hour period


                                     -48-
<PAGE>


commencing at the close of business on the Determination Date, if the Parent
Market Price is less than $40 and (B) the Company gives Parent written notice
of its intention to terminate this Agreement (the "Termination Notice") within
the aforementioned 24-hour period, provided that the Company may withdraw the
Termination Notice at any time within the aforementioned 24-hour hour period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no right of termination shall arise under this
Section 7.1(i) if Parent shall have given written notice to the Company at any
time within 24 hours of its receipt of the Termination Notice that Parent
elects to adjust the Exchange Ratio to a number equal to a quotient (rounded to
the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is $92, and the
denominator of which is the Parent Market Price. If Parent makes an election
contemplated by the preceding sentence and so notifies the Company within such
24-hour period, the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have
been so modified), and any references in this Agreement to Exchange Ratio shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to
this Section 7.1(i).

          7.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective officers or
directors except with respect to Section 3.1(l), Section 3.2(l), Section 5.6,
this Section 7.2 and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive such
termination, and except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its breach of this
Agreement, including any representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein.

          (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i)
Section 7.1(d) due to a failure of the Company shareholders to approve the
Merger and this Agreement and within twelve months of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a
Business Combination, (ii) Section 7.1(e), (iii) Section 7.1(g) by Parent and
within twelve months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with a third party with respect to a Business Combination or (iv)
Section 7.1(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent as liquidated damages, not
later than three Business Days after such termination, an amount in cash equal
to $420 million (the "Company Termination Fee") provided, however, that, with
respect to clauses (i) and (iii), the Company Termination Fee shall be payable
only as provided above and in such case no later than three Business Days after
the date a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a Business
Combination is executed.

          (c) For the purposes of this Section 7.2, "Business Combination"
means (i) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company as a result of which either (A) the Company's
shareholders prior to such transaction (by virtue of their ownership of the
Company's shares) in the aggregate cease to own at least 50% of the voting
securities of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the
ultimate parent entity thereof) or, regardless of the percentage of voting
securities held by such shareholders, if any Person shall beneficially own,

by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of the Company and Parent, but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such

except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

          7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.
