Section 2.05 _Member and Officers of Surviving LLC._ Parent, the sole member
of MergerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the sole
member of Surviving LLC and the officers of MergerSub, if any, immediately

of Surviving LLC.

  

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 ** _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER_**

  

Section 3.01 _Effects on Shares and Membership Interests._ As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of Company Common Shares or holders of any membership interests in
MergerSub:

  

(a) Each membership interest in MergerSub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain as one issued and outstanding
membership interest in Surviving LLC.

  

(b) Each Company Common Share that is owned by the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company or by MergerSub shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

(c) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
3.01(b)) shall automatically be converted into, and canceled in exchange for,
the right to receive an amount in cash to be paid by Surviving LLC equal to
(i) $36.15 (the " _Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration_ ") plus,
to the extent the Companys regular dividend with respect to the third (3rd)
fiscal quarter of 2006 has not previously been paid, (ii) an amount in cash
equal to $0.525 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
number of days between the last day of the second (2nd) fiscal quarter of
2006 and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date) by (y) the total
number of days in the third (3rd) fiscal quarter of 2006, without interest,
provided that if such quotient exceeds one (1) it shall be deemed to equal
one (1) (the " _Additional Company Common Share Merger Consideration_ ," and
together with the Company Common Share Cash Merger Consideration, the "
_Company Common Share Merger Consideration_ ").

  

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or
nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares (" _Company
Share Options_ ") under any employee share option or compensation
plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company (" _Company Option Plans_ "),
shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not then vested or
subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied, and
regardless of the exercise price thereof). The Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that, at the Effective Time,
each Company Share Option not theretofore exercised shall be canceled in

     

   

exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, less any
applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Share Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Share Option (the " _Option Merger
Consideration_ "). If the exercise price per share of any such Company Share
Option is equal to or greater than the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions
so that such Company Share Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

  

(e) The Buyer Parties acknowledge that all outstanding restricted share
awards (" _Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys
Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Incentive
Plan_ ") or otherwise, including any Company Restricted Shares issued in
connection with the initial public offering of the common stock of the
Company, that remain unvested, shall automatically become fully vested and
free of any forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and each Company Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding Company
Common Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to
receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration.

  

(f) The Buyer Parties acknowledge that all deferred share unit awards ("
_Company Deferred Share Units_ ") granted pursuant to the Incentive Plan or
otherwise (including any Company Deferred Share Units previously and
additionally credited to the account of the holder of such Company Deferred
Share Units after the grant date on account of the reinvestment of dividend
equivalents) automatically shall become fully vested and free of any
forfeiture restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
Company Deferred Share Unit shall be considered an outstanding Company Common
Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration. Payment of the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration in respect of any Company Deferred Share
Unit shall be performed in accordance with Section 7.05(d).

  

Section 3.02 _Effect on Units of Partnership Interest of the Operating
Partnership._

  

(a) In connection with the Merger and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 7.11 hereof, Parent and MergerSub shall offer to each
Existing Unit Holder (the " _Operating Partnership Offer_ ") the
opportunity to receive in cash, in exchange for each issued and outstanding
Existing Unit held by such holder, an amount equal to (i) $36.15 plus, to the
extent the regular distribution with respect to the third (3rd) fiscal
quarter of 2006 has not previously been paid, (ii) an amount in cash equal to
$0.525 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days
between the last day of the second (2nd) fiscal quarter of 2006 and the
Closing Date (including the Closing Date) by (y) the total number of days in
the third (3rd) fiscal quarter of 2006, without interest, provided that if
such quotient exceeds one (1) it shall be deemed to equal one (1) (the "
_Existing Unit Consideration_ "). Any Existing Unit Holder who elects not to
accept the Operating Partnership Offer, or does not timely and properly
return an

     

   



  

Election Form as set forth in Section 7.11, shall remain as a limited partner
of the Operating Partnership, and continue to hold Existing Units with the
rights, terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Operating Partnership
Agreement, and shall not be entitled to receive any distributions in respect
of such Existing Units in connection with the Merger.

  

(b) Concurrently with the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall cause
(i) Heritage-Austen Acquisition, Inc., the general partner of the Operating
Partnership, to be merged with and into MergerSub or a subsidiary of
MergerSub, and (ii) the Operating Partnership Agreement to be amended, as
permitted by Section 17.2 of the Operating Partnership Agreement, in
substantially the form of the amended Operating Partnership Agreement
attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Amended Operating Partnership
Agreement_ ").

  

Section 3.03 _Exchange of Certificates and Uncertificated Units; Paying
Agent._

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Exchange
and Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment or exchange, as
applicable, in accordance with this Article III, of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration and the Existing Unit
Consideration (collectively, such cash being referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) deposit with the
Paying Agent the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the Option
Merger Consideration for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares,
Company Share Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Deferred Share
Units, and (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent the portion of the Existing
Unit Consideration payable by it in respect of Existing Units (other than
Continuing Units) pursuant to Section 3.02(a). Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration and the
Existing Unit Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on
cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Surviving LLC.

  

(b) _Share Transfer Books; Existing Unit Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company Common
Shares, Company Restricted Shares or Company Deferred Share Units. From and
after the Effective Time, persons who held Company Common Shares, Company
Restricted Shares or Company Deferred Share Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares or
units, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective
Time, any Certificates of the Company presented to the Paying Agent,
Surviving LLC or the transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Common
Shares formerly represented thereby. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the transfer books of the Operating Partnership of
Existing Units other than transfers of Continuing Units. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Existing Units outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than Continuing Units

     

   



  

shall cease to have rights with respect to such Existing Units, except as
otherwise provided for herein.

  

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days), Surviving LLC shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately prior to the
Effective Time held Company Common Shares that were converted into the right
to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.01: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the holders Certificates
in exchange for the Company Common Share Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory
to the Company as may be appointed by Surviving LLC, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange
therefor the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Company Common Shares, previously represented by such Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Section 3.03. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration.

  

(d) _Exchange Procedures for Existing Units_. Promptly after the Effective
Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), the Surviving LLC
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who immediately prior to
the Effective Time held Existing Units that were not represented by unit
certificates (" _Uncertificated Units_ ") and that were exchanged for the
right to receive the Existing Unit Consideration pursuant to Section
3.02(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which letter shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the exchange of the Uncertificated Units
for the Existing Unit Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled.
Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Uncertificated
Units shall receive in exchange therefor the Existing Unit Consideration
payable in respect of the Existing Units previously held pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Existing Units that is not registered

     

   



  

in the transfer records of the Operating Partnership, payment may be made to
a person other than the person in whose name such records indicate if
Surviving LLC shall be presented with a proper form for such transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than indicated in such records or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until the procedures set forth in this Section 3.03(d) have been
satisfied, each Uncertificated Unit, other than Continuing Units, shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive the Existing Unit Consideration as contemplated by this Section
3.03 (d) have been filed. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the
Existing Unit Consideration.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares, Company Share
Options or Existing Units Exchanged for Partnership Merger Consideration_. At
the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the right to
receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration provided under this
Article III. The Company Common Share Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Company Common Shares exchanged theretofore and represented by such
Certificates. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company
Share Options in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the canceled Company Share Options, and on and after the
Effective Time the holder of a Company Share Option shall have no further
rights with respect to any Company Share Option, other than the right to
receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(d). The
Existing Unit Consideration paid with respect to Existing Units that are
exchanged therefor in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to such Existing Units, and on and after the Effective Time the
holder of any such Existing Unit shall have no further rights with respect to
any Existing Unit, other than the right to receive the Existing Unit
Consideration provided under this Article III.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Share
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Deferred Share Units or Existing
Units which were exchanged for the right to receive the Existing Unit
Consideration for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Surviving LLC, and any holders of Company Common Shares, Company
Share Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Deferred Share Units or
Existing Units prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Surviving LLC for payment
of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger
Consideration or the Existing Unit Consideration, as applicable.

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, MergerSub, Surviving LLC, the Company or
the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, stockholder, partner,
member, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any person in respect
of the Company Common Share Merger

     

   



  

Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or the Existing Unit
Consideration, if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Surviving LLC, on a daily
basis. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be placed in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there
are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes
for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or the
Existing Unit Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments
or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make all such payments in full.

  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent reasonably may direct, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Section 3.04 _Withholding Rights._ Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Shares, Company Share Options or Existing Units such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Shares, Company Share
Options or Existing Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Surviving LLC or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

  

Section 3.05 _Dissenters  Rights._ No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

 **ARTICLE IV**

  

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and MergerSub as follows:

     

   



  

Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries; Authority._

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and
carry on its business as now conducted.

  

(b) Each of the Companys subsidiaries, including the Companys Operating
Partnerships (the " _Subsidiaries_ "), together with the jurisdiction of
organization of each such subsidiary and the percentage of the
outstanding equity of each such subsidiary owned by the Company and each
other subsidiary of the Company, is set forth on Section 4.01(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule. Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule also sets
forth, as of the date of this Agreement, the name of each Person (other than
the Company or a Subsidiary) that holds, directly or indirectly, an equity
interest in any Subsidiary, and the type and amount of equity interest held
by each such Person. Except as set forth in Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any shares of stock of, or other equity interest in, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
business association or entity. Each Subsidiary is a corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, trust or other business association

assets of the Company on a consolidated basis and except also for such
imperfections of title or leasehold interest, easement and encumbrances, if
any, as do not materially interfere with the present use of the properties
subject thereto or affected thereby.

Section 4.15 _Taxes._  As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth
on Section 4.15 of the Disclosure Schedule; and as of the Closing, except as

in the aggregate, have not resulted, or would not reasonably be expected to
result, in liabilities or obligations in excess of $25,000,000:

  

(a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or had
filed on their behalf) all Tax Returns, as defined below, required to be
filed by them (after giving effect to any filing extension granted by a
Governmental Authority) and such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects, and (ii) has timely paid (or had timely paid on
their behalf) all federal income Taxes and all other material Taxes (whether
or not shown on such Tax Returns) that are required to be paid by it under
the applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment of such
Taxes. The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Reports, each as amended to the date hereof, filed prior to the date hereof
reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax items) for all
Taxes payable (whether or not due at such time) by the Company and the
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. True, correct and complete copies of all federal
Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to the taxable
years commencing on or after July 1999 have been delivered or made available
to representatives of Parent. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
has executed or filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any
agreement, waiver or other document or arrangement extending the period for
assessment or collection of material Taxes (including, but not limited to,
any applicable statute of limitation), and no power of attorney with respect
to any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. As used here, the term " _Tax Returns_ " means all reports,
returns, declarations, statements or other information required to be
supplied to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes.

  

(b) The Company, (i) for each taxable year of its existence, has been subject
to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2005
to the date hereof in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT for
the taxable year that includes the date hereof, and (iii) shall continue to
operate in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT for
each taxable year of the Company through the taxable year that will end with
the Merger. The Company has not taken any action or omitted to take
any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a successful
challenge by the IRS to its status as a REIT, and no challenge to the
Companys status as a REIT is pending or has been threatened in writing or,
to the knowledge of the Company, otherwise threatened. No Subsidiary is a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that, at all times commencing with the Companys taxable year ended December
31, 1999, during which the Company has held, directly or indirectly, its
stock, has qualified as a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the

(c) Each Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, trust or limited
liability company has been since its formation treated for U.S. federal

the extent of any gain that was required to be recognized under Section
1031(b) of the Code and that was timely reported on the Tax Returns of the
Company.

  

(f) The Company has not incurred any liability for taxes under sections
856(c), 856(g), 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or any rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a risk that
any material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed on the
Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has engaged at any time in
any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (other than a "taxable REIT
subsidiary") has engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess interest" described
in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes other
than in the ordinary course of business.

or any Subsidiary as a result of any examinations by the IRS or any other
taxing authority of the Tax Returns of or covering or including the Company
or any Subsidiary have been fully paid, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no other audits, examinations or other proceedings relating to any
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary by any taxing authority in progress.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any taxing authority that it intends to conduct such an audit, examination or
other proceeding in respect to Taxes or make any assessment for Taxes and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no such audit, examination, or other proceeding
is threatened. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any
litigation or pending litigation or administrative proceeding relating to
Taxes (other than litigation dealing with appeals of property tax
valuations).

  

(h) The Company and the Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any
foreign laws) and have duly and timely withheld and have

     

   

paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required
to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

  

(i) No claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the
Company or any such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such claim is
threatened.

  

(j) Neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary has requested any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return, which material Tax Return has not yet been filed.

  

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax sharing or
similar agreement or arrangement other than any agreement or arrangement
solely between the Company and any Subsidiary, pursuant to which it will have
any obligation to make any payments after the Closing.

  

(l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has requested or received a ruling
from, or requested or entered into a binding agreement with, the IRS or other

another person as a transferee or successor or by contract.

  

(n) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable)
upon any of the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary.

  

(o) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, the Company is a
"domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of
the Code.

  

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or is
subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreements other than
those that are disclosed in Section 4.15(p) of the Disclosure Schedule.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with all material
terms of the Tax Protection Agreements. No Person has raised in writing, or
to the knowledge of the Company threatened to raise, a claim against the
Company or any Subsidiary for any breach of any Tax Protection Agreement.

  

As used herein, " _Tax Protection Agreements_ " shall mean any written or
oral agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party pursuant to
which: (a) any liability to partners in the Operating Partnership or any
other Subsidiary or to any transferors of

     

   

property to the Company or any Subsidiary relating to Taxes may arise,
whether or not as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
have agreed to (i) maintain a minimum level of debt or continue a particular

the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law) to
adjust the basis of its property as provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of
the Code.

  

(s) Section 4.15(s) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each entity in
which the Company or a Subsidiary owns an equity interest and states whether
such entity is classified as a partnership, disregarded entity, or a
corporation for federal income tax purposes. In the case of an entity
classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, such schedule

from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Other Filings and shall promptly provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy
Statement or the Other Filings. If at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, officers, members or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the
Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the
Other Filings (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and

substantive calls between the Company, or any of its representatives, and the
SEC concerning the Proxy Statement.

(including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable after the date that the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
advise and recommend to its stockholders the approval of the Merger and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified its approval or recommendation of
the Merger in compliance with Section 7.04. Subject to Section 7.04,
the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger and will take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of

Section 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries
to afford Parent, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance
with this Section 7.03, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other
facilities, contracts, commitments, books and records of the Company and each
Subsidiary, and all other financial, operating and other data and information
and any other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither

which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii)
contact or have any discussions with any of the landlords/sublandlords,
tenants/subtenants, or licensees or franchisees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior written consent of
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof, or (iv) perform
any onsite procedure or investigation (including any onsite environmental
investigation or study) without the Companys prior written consent. Parent
shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give
the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice thereof,
setting forth the inspection or materials that Parent or its representatives
intend to conduct or review, as applicable, and Parent is required to give
the Company such written notice at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
date that any tenant of a Company Property which Parent wishes to inspect is
entitled to receive notice of any such inspection under the applicable
Company Lease. The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present
at all times during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement, provided that, if requested to do so by Parent, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver from the
counterparty.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent pursuant
to this Section 7.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the

Section 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  

(a) Subject to Sections 7.04(b), 7.04(c) and 7.04(d), none of the Company or
any Subsidiary shall, nor shall any of them authorize or permit, directly
or indirectly, any of their respective officers, trustees, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants, attorneys,
brokers, finders or other agents, advisors or representatives (each, a

     

   



  

" _Representative_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly take any other action to facilitate (including by way
of furnishing information (other than public information widely disseminated
through SEC Reports, press releases or other similar means) or assistance)
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or other action that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations, or furnish to any
Person not a party to this Agreement any information in furtherance of any
inquiries that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, confidentiality
agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or
related to, or intended to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in or permitted by Section 7.04(c)), or that is intended or that could
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, termination or failure
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated immediately
any discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties
that are currently ongoing with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 7.04 shall preclude the Company, any Subsidiary or
their respective Representatives from complying with the provisions of the
last sentence of this Section 7.04(a). The Company and the Subsidiaries shall
be responsible for any failure on the part of their respective
Representatives to comply with this Section 7.04(a). The Company shall
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with a potential transaction with (whether by merger,
acquisition, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise) the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any material portion of their assets, to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of the Company or any Subsidiary.

  

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing (as soon as is
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 24 hours from initial
receipt or occurrence) of any Acquisition Proposal or any negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the parties
and all material terms thereof) which any of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any such Representative may receive after the date hereof, and the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received
in connection with the forgoing, so long as it does not contravene a
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (provided
that if requested to do so by Parent, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver from the counterparty), and shall keep
Parent informed on a prompt basis as to the status, material terms and
conditions and any material developments regarding any such proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause any Subsidiary to not, terminate, release,
waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill agreement,
confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party and the Company shall, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

     

   



  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a) and Section 7.04(b) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, following the receipt after the
date hereof, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
by the Company or any Subsidiary of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section
7.04(a) and Section 7.04(b)), the Company Board may (directly or
through Representatives) (i) contact such Person and its advisors solely for
the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms thereof and
the conditions to and likelihood of consummation, so as to determine whether
the proposal for an Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board
may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consulting with
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable Law, (A) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries to the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that the Company (1) has previously
or concurrently furnished such information to Parent and (2) shall
furnish such information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which
contains terms and conditions not less restrictive to the Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement), (B) disclose to its stockholders any information
required to be disclosed under applicable Law and (C) participate in
negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

  

(d) Following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, neither the Company Board nor any Committee thereof shall withdraw
or modify (in a manner adverse to Parent), or fail to make, the Company
Recommendation or recommend that the Companys stockholders approve such
Superior Proposal (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) no Change in
Recommendation shall be made until after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (i) advising
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, (ii) if in
response to a Superior Proposal, advising Parent of the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notice be provided to Parent and a new five (5)
Business Day period), and (iii) representing that the Company has complied
with this Section 7.04, (B) during such five (5) Business Day period, the
Company, if requested by Parent, shall negotiate with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger and not make a Change in Recommendation and (C) the Company shall
not make a Change in Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal if,
prior to the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period, Parent delivers
a definitive proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors) causes the Acquisition Proposal to no longer be a
Superior Proposal.

     

   



  

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
compliance by the Company with such obligations shall not relieve the Company
of any of its obligations under the provisions of this Section 7.04.

  

Section 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor in accordance with
their terms all severance, change-of-control and similar obligations of the

successors or assigns or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall provide the Continuing Employees with
total compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee will be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date under the parallel
employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the same extent as
such employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under the respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits and except with respect to benefit
accrual under a defined benefit plan). In addition, with respect to each
health benefit plan, during the calendar year that includes the Closing Date,
each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid by the
employee under the respective Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Parent or Surviving LLC.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition

Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common Share Options to
acquire Company Common Shares (or Company Common Shares acquired upon the
vesting of any Company Restricted Share or Company Deferred Share Unit)
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as
are necessary to terminate the Companys Deferred Share Unit arrangements and

additional liability or expense to the Company, is in good faith compliance
with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and which is subject to the
prior approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or

agreements of any of the Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Date,
Parent and Surviving LLC shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person
who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through
the Effective Date serving as a director, officer, trustee, or fiduciary of

penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security (but subject to Parents or Surviving LLCs, as applicable, receipt
of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if
required by applicable Law, to repay such Expenses if it is ultimately
determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified). The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent
and Surviving LLC pursuant to this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such

investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any

     

   



  

such Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative
dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing or any other person at or prior
to the Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys
fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including,
without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.

entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerSub agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter,
bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or
other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.06(b) of the Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by
Surviving LLC in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time
and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the operating
agreement of Surviving LLC shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees, employees,
agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless such
modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by Law.

  

(d) Surviving LLC shall maintain for a period of at least six (6) years the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the

     

   



  

Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) that Surviving LLC may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured, _provided_ that such substitution shall not
result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before
the Effective Time; (ii) in no event shall Surviving LLC be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 7.06(d) more than an amount per year of
coverage equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Surviving LLC would be
required to expend more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company, Surviving LLC shall obtain the maximum
amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause Surviving LLC or its successors
or assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor all obligations thereunder.

  

(e) If Surviving LLC or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving limited liability company, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Surviving LLC assumes the obligations set forth in this Section

grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, the Operating Partnership, Parent
and Surviving LLC. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to

the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, if required, (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective

any additional documents or instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the
Company shall timely file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC all Company SEC
Reports required to be so filed by applicable Law.

  

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 7.07, including the preparation and making of the filings referred to
therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information
thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the non filing party
and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, neither
of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any
Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party. Each
party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent
practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto
shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings
and calls with such Governmental Authority.

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action,
including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts,
delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger, including, without
limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal.

  

(d) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify
Parent with respect to any matter hereafter arising or any information
obtained after the date hereof which, if existing, occurring or known at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of determining the
accuracy of any representation or the satisfaction of the conditions to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, no such supplement,
amendment or information provided by the Company shall be considered.

  

(e) Reference is made to the Companys outstanding 4.50% notes due 2009 and
5.125% Notes due 2014 (collectively, the " _Company Notes_ ") and any and all
notes issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of November 27, 1997, by and
between Bradley Operating Limited Partnership (the " _Bradley OP_ ") and
LaSalle National Bank (the " _Bradley Notes_ " and together with the Company
Notes, the " _Notes_ "). If requested by Parent, on reasonable notice, the
Company and the Bradley OP shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to commence as promptly as practicable following the date of receipt
of the Offer Documents from Parent pursuant to subparagraph (ii) below
and instructions from Parent to commence the Debt Offers, offers to purchase,
and related consent solicitations with respect to, all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Notes on the terms and conditions as may be
agreed between

     

   



  

the Company and Parent (including the related consent solicitations,
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); provided that (i) this Agreement shall
have not been terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, (ii) the Company
shall have received from Parent the completed Offer Documents, and (iii)
at the time of such commencement, the Buyer Parties shall have otherwise
performed or complied with all of their agreements and covenants required by
this Agreement to be performed on or prior to the time that the Debt Offers
are to be commenced. The Company and the Bradley OP shall waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have been
consummated and that there shall be no order prohibiting consummation of the
Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without
the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make
any changes to the Debt Offers other than as agreed between Parent and the
Company. Neither the Company nor the Bradley OP need make any change to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Offers without their prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that such consent shall
not be required for an increase in any consideration payable in the Debt
Offers or for any change that is not material. If the Debt Offers are made
pursuant to this Section 7.7(e), the Company and the Bradley OP agree that,
promptly following the consent expiration date, assuming the requisite
consents are received, each of the Company, the Bradley OP and their
Subsidiaries as is necessary shall execute supplemental indentures to the
indentures governing the Notes, which supplemental indentures shall implement
the amendments set forth in the Offer Documents and shall become operative
concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Bradley OP to
accept for payment and after the Effective Time Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or the Bradley OP to promptly pay for the Notes that
have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt
Offers and in accordance with the Debt Offers.

  

(f) If Parent determines to request that the Debt Offers be commenced, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent,
at its own expense, shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation
in connection with the Debt Offers, including the offers to purchase,
related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the
" _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, the Company and the Bradley OP shall, and
shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each
other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents
(including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the
holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If at any time
prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the Offer
Documents should be discovered by the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company and the
Bradley OP to the holders of the applicable Notes. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 7.07, the Company and the Bradley OP shall
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the

     

   



  

Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are
applicable in connection with the Debt Offers. To the extent that the

awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with any dealer manager agreement) from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offers and
the Offer Documents; provided, however, that none of the Buyer Parties shall
have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person
to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred
arises from disclosure regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries supplied by
such party or person or included in any Company SEC Report that is determined
to have contained a material misstatement or omission.

  

(h) To the extent that, as of the Closing Date, the consents to be specified

respect to any series of Notes by the holders thereof, the Company and the
Bradley OP shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, issue an
irrevocable notice of optional redemption for all of the then outstanding
Notes of such series in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture
governing such series of the Notes and which shall provide for the
satisfaction and discharge of such Notes and such indentures in accordance
with the terms thereof; provided, Parent shall have provided written notice
to the Company confirming that all conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and
8.02 have been satisfied (or with respect to Section 8.02, waived) and that
the Buyer Parties are prepared to proceed immediately with the Closing; and
provided further that, the Buyer Parties shall have irrevocably deposited
with the applicable trustee under each indenture sufficient funds to effect
such satisfaction and discharge.

documents governing such secured debt do not prohibit a prepayment notice
from being revocable or conditional and (ii) Parent has delivered a written
direction to the Company to deliver such notices not less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the date that such notices are otherwise required to

each such tenant, or if no such form was previously executed by a tenant, in
the form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

  

(k) If any Company Title Insurance Policy shows title defects which would be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to
generate revenue at the Company Property as presently constructed or the
ability of Parent to obtain financing providing

     

   



  

for a first priority mortgage lien on the Company Property (a " _Major Title
Defect_ "), and Parent has delivered to the Company and its counsel an
itemized written notice of such Major Title Defects (" _Parent s Title
Notice_") within thirty (30) Business Days after the receipt of such Company
Title Insurance Policy, then the Company or its Subsidiaries shall use

Section 7.10 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  

(a) (a) For federal and applicable state income tax purposes, the Company
shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable sale by the Company of all of
the Companys assets to MergerSub in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
be received by holders of Company Common Shares and the assumption of all of
the Companys liabilities, followed by the Companys liquidating distribution
of the Merger Consideration to its stockholders under Section 331 of the Code
and Section 562 of the Code. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
liquidation" of the Company for federal income tax purposes and the Company
Board, prior to that date on which the Effective Time occurs, will adopt this
Agreement as such plan.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause all of its
subsidiaries that are treated as "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the
meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code to be converted into limited
liability companies that are (i) disregarded for United States federal income
tax purposes and (ii) not treated as "qualified REIT subsidiaries" within the
meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code (the " _Conversion_ "). The Company
shall provide to Parent written evidence of the Conversion including a
schedule setting forth all of the subsidiaries so converted prior to the
Effective Time.

  

Section 7.11 _Form of Election_.

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare a form of election in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Election Form_ "), describing the
Operating Partnership Offer and pursuant to which each Existing Unit Holder
will have the right to specify the number, if any, of Existing Units which it
desires to have exchanged for the right to receive an amount equal to the
Existing Unit Consideration. The Election Form shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to, and subject to the review of, Parent, and
Parents indication of such satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. In order for an Existing Unit Holder to be eligible to elect to
have its Existing Units redeemed pursuant to the Operating Partnership Offer,
such Redeeming Existing Unit Holder shall have submitted an Election Form
in accordance with the procedures and time periods specified in this Section
7.11 and as shall be described more fully in the Election Form.

  

(b) The Company shall mail an Election Form to each Existing Unit Holder,
together with any other materials that the Company and Parent determine to be
necessary or prudent. An election to receive the Existing Unit Consideration
in the Operating Partnership Offer shall be effective only if a properly
executed Election Form is received by the Company or its designees prior to
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the
date of the mailing of the Election Form, or such longer period as the
parties shall agree. If an Existing Unit Holder fails to return a duly
completed Election Form within the time period specified in the Election
Form, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to remain as a limited
partner of the Operating Partnership, and continue to hold Existing Units
with substantially the rights, terms and conditions set forth in the Amended
Operating Partnership Agreement. Parent and Company agree that (i) the
Existing Unit Holders shall have the right to revoke any election made in
connection with the Operating Partnership Offer at any time prior to

     

   



  

the expiration of the offering period stated in the Election Form, and (ii)
the Operating Partnership Offer shall be conducted in accordance with all
applicable Law and the Operating Partnership Agreement. Parent and the
Company by mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules,
not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity
of Election Forms and the issuance and delivery of the Existing
Unit Consideration, as applicable.

  

(c) Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Election Form, (i) Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence, and (ii)
Parent and the Company shall, in cooperation with each other, prepare any
such amendment or supplement to the Election Form, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the indication of such satisfaction not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(d) The obligation of the Company and Parent to consummate the Operating
Partnership Offer shall be conditioned upon, and shall be subject to, the
concurrent Closing of the Merger as provided in this Agreement.

  

Section 7.12 _Financing; Cooperation with Financing_.

  

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the debt financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ "), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and
(ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive
agreements. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letter, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to
obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or
any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall not permit any
material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter without first
notifying the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing (or
any alternative financing) has not been obtained, Parent shall continue to be
obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this Agreement and to Parents rights
under Section 9.01, regardless of whether Parent have complied with all of
their other obligations under this Agreement (including their obligations
under this Section 7.12).

  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including without
limitation, (a) delivering such financial and statistical information and
projections relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested in

     

   



  

connection with the Debt Financing, (b) making appropriate officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries available for due diligence meetings and for
participation in meetings with rating agencies and prospective sources of
financing, (c) providing timely access to diligence materials and appropriate
personnel to allow sources of financing and their representatives to complete
all appropriate diligence, (d) providing assistance with respect to the
review and granting of mortgages and security interests in collateral for the
Debt Financing, and obtaining any consents associated therewith, and (e)
obtaining estoppels and certificates from tenants, lenders and ground lessors
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to any potential lender. Parent
shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable costs incurred in
performing their obligations under this Section 7.12(b).

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of
this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

     

   



  

Section 10.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken by their respective board of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that, after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company, no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which,
by Law or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval
by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any of its
affiliates and Parent may substitute any other wholly-owned entity for
MergerSub, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the Parent from
any obligation hereunder.

  

Section 10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, the parties hereto
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity.

  

Section 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Article III and
Section 7.06 and Section 7.07(g) (which are intended to be for the benefit of
the persons covered thereby or the persons entitled to payment or
indemnification thereunder and may be enforced by such persons).

  

Section 10.08 _Governing Law; Enforcement and Forum_. All disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules of conflict of
laws.

  

Each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Maryland or any court of the United States located
in the State of Maryland (the " _Maryland Courts_ ") for any litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity of
performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties

     

   



  

hereto agrees (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to
service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent
in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal
process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by
prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the
United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service
made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect
as if served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland.

  

Section 10.09 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

Section 10.11 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

  

Section 10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 10.11.

  

Section 10.13 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this Agreement
shall be cumulative and shall not preclude the assertion by the parties
hereto of any other rights or the seeking of any other remedies, whether at
law or in equity, against the other parties, or their respective successors
or assigns.
