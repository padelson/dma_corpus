disagreement over such  calculation.

required to  determine the Closing Net Working Capital and/or the Purchase
Price Adjustment  is resolved by the Accounting Firm, Buyer or Seller, as
appropriate, shall  make  the payments, including interest, described in

deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Allocation  Statement_ "),  allocating
the Purchase Price (plus the liabilities of the MPP to the extent  properly
taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the assets  of  MPP

delivery of the Allocation Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that 
Seller objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement,
Buyer  and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
dispute  within 20 days. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such
dispute within  20  days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain a mutually
satisfactory nationally  recognized accounting firm (which firm shall not

Allocation Referee_ ")  to  resolve the disputed items. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein,  Buyer and Seller (and the Tax Allocation
Referee, if applicable) shall resolve  all disputed items no later than 60

equally by Buyer and Seller.  Upon  resolution of the disputed items, the
allocation reflected on the Allocation  Statement shall be adjusted to
reflect such resolution. Seller  and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the
Allocation Statement and (ii) act in  accordance with the Allocation
Statement in the preparation, filing and audit  of  any Tax Return

(b) On  or  before the Closing, but effective immediately prior to the
Closing Date, Seller  shall take all necessary actions to cause the MPP
401(k) Plan to be terminated.  On or before the Closing, but effective as of
the Closing Date, Seller shall  take all actions necessary to cause (i) MPP
to cease to be an adopting or  participating employer under all Employee
Plans and (ii) MPP to transfer its  sponsorship and **** all  of  its
obligations and Liabilities relating to the Employee Plans to  Seller  or
an  Affiliate of Seller.  Seller  shall remain solely responsible for the
Employee Plans, and Buyer shall not,  and  from and after the Closing Date
the Entities shall not, have any  responsibilities or Liabilities with
respect to the Employee Plans. Without  limiting the scope of the preceding
provisions of this _Section  5.3(b)_ ,  Seller  shall, if required by Law,
provide COBRA or other continuation coverage (within  the meaning of Section
4980B of the Code and the Treasury regulations  thereunder) to all
individuals who are M and A qualified beneficiaries (within  the meaning
assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury regulation section  54.4980B-9)
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  for  the
duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such 
coverage. Seller shall take any and all necessary actions to ensure that
Buyer,  MPP, the Entities and their respective Affiliates are not required to
provide  such continuation coverage to any such individual at any time. By
executing  the  Assumption Agreement on the Closing Date, Seller agrees to
assume and be  responsible for the payment of all pre-Closing Date, employee-
related  Liabilities (e.g., accrued and unpaid salary or wages, vacation pay,
accrued  and  withholding taxes, and other accrued and liabilities under any
Employee Plans)  with respect to the MPP Employees and any and all former
employees of MPP,  the  Entities and any of their predecessors,  provided
that such liabilities may be taken into account in the Closing  Net Working
Capital in which case, they may be paid by Buyer.

 

 

(c) On  or  before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred to
Seller the  employment of each individual employed by an Entity (i) who is on
a disability  or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date or (ii) who
has been identified  on a list furnished by Buyer to Seller at least two
Business Days prior to  the  Closing Date. Each MPP Employee who is employed
by MPP on the Closing Date  and  whose employment is not transferred as
provided in the preceding sentence is  referred to herein as a "
_Transferred  Employee_."

 

 

(d) For  purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under
the employee  benefit plans of Buyer or its Affiliates providing benefits to
Transferred  Employees after the Closing Date (the " _DCP  Plans_ "),  to 
the extent permitted by the terms of the insured DCP Plans, and for purposes 
of  determining the vacation and sick leave benefits to be provided to
Transferred  Employees under the DCP Plans, Buyer shall  cause each
Transferred Employee to be credited with his or her years of service  with
MPP and predecessor entities to the same extent, if any, as such  Transferred
Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date to  credit for
such service under any similar Employee Plan. Seller has provided  Buyer with
all the necessary information to enable Buyer to credit such prior  service
credit. The DCP Plans that provide medical and dental benefits shall  credit
Transferred Employees for the year in which the Closing Date occurs  with 
any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Transferred
Employees  under the corresponding Employee Plans during the portion of such
year preceding  the Closing Date ( _provided,  however_ ,  that  such
credit shall only be provided based on information Seller provides to 
Buyer  pursuant to the following sentence). Seller shall provide to Buyer
within 60  days after the Closing Date a list of deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenses  for  the year in which the Closing Date occurs for the
Transferred Employees and  their dependents who provide authorization for the
release of such data. Each  Transferred Employee shall be eligible for
vacation and sick leave effective  as  of the day after the Closing Date to
the same extent as similarly situated  employees of Buyer (prorated for the
number of days remaining in Buyer's fiscal  year), taking into account the
prior service credit granted in accordance with  this _Section  5.3_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  35 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) During  the final 10 Business Days preceding the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall  cooperate in scheduling (i) all Employees to participate in
Buyer's safety and  process safety management two day training course and
(ii) those Employees  directly (and on a relief basis) involved in the
operation of the Grands Lacs  pipeline, to participate in Buyer's Operator
Qualified Program to ensure that  those Employees are qualified under U.S.
Department of Transportation Part  192  regulations; the foregoing shall be
conducted while maintaining reasonable  staffing at MPP for operations.

 



 

(f) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit in any
way the ability  of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Transferred  Employee from and after the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
that  Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall be responsible for issuing
required  notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
and similar  foreign, state and local rules, statutes and ordinances
resulting from the  actions of Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing
Date, and shall be  responsible for the consequences of failure to so comply.

 

 

(g) From  the  date hereof through the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, without the  prior written consent of Buyer, neither Seller, nor any of
its members or any  or  its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment or employ  (i) any Transferred Employee or (ii) any
other employee of Buyer or its  Affiliates; _provided_   that  this Section
shall not prohibit (A) solicitation of Transferred Employees whose 
employment has been terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing 
Date  or (B) general solicitations to the public or general advertising not 
specifically directed toward any Transferred Employee.

 

 

(h) Nothing  in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or this _Section 
5.3_   shall  provide any MPP Employee or any other Person any separate
right or  cause  of action against Buyer, MPP, any Entity or Seller. The
duties and obligations  of Seller and Buyer to each other hereunder are
intended to be enforceable  only  between them, and do not grant any
benefits, duties or obligations to any third  party, including the current or
future employees of Buyer or its Affiliates  or  the employees of Seller,
MPP, or any of the Entities or any of their respective  Affiliates. Nothing
in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall amend  or modify, or be
construed as amending or modifying, any benefit plan, program  or agreement
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller, MPP, any Entity,  Buyer,
or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, whether 
express or implied shall limit the right of Seller, MPP, any Entity, Buyer, 
or  any of their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify  any  such benefit plan, program or agreement after the Closing Date.

_Section  5.4_ _Tax  Covenants_.

 

 

(a) _Tax  Return Filings, Refunds, and Credits_.

 

 

(i) Seller  shall timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation and
filing) with the  appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns with respect to
MPP and the Entities  for Tax periods that end on or before the Effective
Date (the " _Seller  Returns_ "),  and  will pay (or cause to be paid) all
Taxes due with respect to the Seller  Returns.  The  taxes shown on the Tax
Returns shall be correct and complete.

 

 

(ii) Buyer  shall timely prepare and file (or cause preparation and filing)
with the  appropriate Tax authorities all Tax Returns with respect to MPP for
all Tax  periods ending after the Effective Date (the " _Buyer  Returns_
"),  and  will pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to the
Buyer Returns.  The taxes shown on the Tax Returns shall be correct and
complete.

 

 

(b) _Property  Tax Pro-ration and Post-Closing Adjustment_.  Ad  valorem
and real and tangible personal property Taxes with respect to the  property
and assets of MPP and the Entities (" _Property  Taxes_ ")  for  the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be prorated between 
Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Date. Actual Property Taxes paid by MPP 
before the Effective Date shall be prorated between the Seller and Buyer as 
of  the Effective Date and the amount allocable for the period after the
Effective  Date shall be included as a prepayment in the Closing Net Working
Capital  calculation as provided in _Section  2.1_.  All  future Property
Taxes paid by MPP after the Effective Date shall be prorated  between the
Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Date and the amount allocable  for the
period prior to the Effective Date shall represent Seller's obligation  and
shall be accounted for in the Post-Closing Purchase Price Reconciliation. 
Any Property Taxes allocable to the Seller's account arising from proration
of  any future Property Tax bill received by MPP after the Post-Closing
Purchase  Price Reconciliation shall be billed to the Seller.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  Taxes_.  Seller  shall bear all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, value  added and other similar Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest)  incurred in connection with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (including any real property
transfer tax and any similar Tax).


 

(d) _Allocation  of Taxes_.  Seller  and Buyer shall, unless prohibited by
applicable state or local Law,  cause MPP and each of the Entities  to
close  all Tax periods at  the  Effective Date. If applicable Law does not
permit  MPP or  any of the Entities  to close Tax  period at 
the Effective  Date, the amount of  Taxes  allocable to the portion of
such period ending at  the Effective  Date shall be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the relevant  taxable period ended at  the 
Effective Date. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine 
any  Income Taxes relating to such period shall be taken into account as
though  the  relevant taxable period ended at  the  Effective Date and by
means of a closing of the books and records of MPP and  the Entities  at
the  Effective Date; _provided_   that  exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis  (including, but not
limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall  be allocated
between the period ending at  the Effective  Date and the period thereafter
in  proportion to the number of days in each such period. All Tax Returns
filed  by  Buyer, Seller or MPP and each of the Entities shall be prepared
consistently  with such allocation. Neither Seller, any of its Subsidiaries
nor Buyer shall  make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or  any  similar provision of state or local Tax) 
to  ratably allocate Tax items for any year or taxable period that includes
the  Closing Date. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, any Tax
payable by MPP or the Entities in  respect of the Michigan Business Tax or
any comparable franchise Tax (a " _Michigan  Tax_ ")  paid  or payable
with respect to MPP or the Entities, shall be allocated to the  taxable
period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising  the
base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business 
for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of the Michigan  Tax.

correct and complete  copies of all Insurance Policies. Seller agrees to
maintain all Insurance  Policies in effect and all premiums therefore fully

cause any or all of the Insurance  Policies to be terminated at any time from
and after the Closing Date and obtain  refunds of unused premiums which will
be taken into account in determining  the  Closing Statement.

 

 

(b) Seller's  only right to receive or share in the proceeds of any Insurance
Policy Claims  from and after the Closing Date are set forth in _Section 
6.3(b)_   below.

as providing  a  benefit or release to any insurer or claims service
organization with respect  to  any obligation under any Insurance Policy.
Nothing herein shall be construed  as  creating or permitting any insurer or
claims service organization the right  of  subrogation against Seller or
Buyer or any of their Affiliates in respect of  payments made by one to the
other under any Insurance Policy.

 

 

_Section  5.6_ _Preservation  of Records_.

 

 

(a) Buyer  agrees that it shall, at its own expense, preserve and keep the
records held  by  it relating to the businesses of MPP that could reasonably
be required after  the  consummation of the transaction contemplated in this
Agreement by Seller for  the  time periods required; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  upon expiration of such period, as applicable, Buyer
shall give written notice  to Seller if it or the custodian of such books and
records proposes to destroy  or dispose of the same. Seller shall have the
opportunity for a period of 30  days after receiving such notice to elect to
have some or all of such books  and  records delivered, at Seller\'s expense
and risk, to a location chosen by Seller.  In addition, Buyer shall make such
records available to Seller as may reasonably  be required by Seller in
connection with, among other things, any insurance  claim, legal proceeding
or governmental investigation relating to the business  of MPP. Seller agrees
to maintain the confidentiality of all information  provided by Buyer or MPP
hereunder during the time periods provided for in  this  Section.

(b) Seller  agrees that it shall, at its own expense, preserve and keep the
records held  by  it relating to the business of MPP which are contained in
the records of Seller  or its Affiliates that could reasonably be required
after the consummation  of  the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
by Seller for the time periods  required. In addition, Seller shall make such

or governmental investigation relating to  MPP.

announcement or regulatory filing concerning the transactions  contemplated
hereby shall be issued by any of the parties without the prior  written
consent of the other parties (which consent shall not unreasonably 
withheld), except for such press release, announcement or regulatory filing 
as  is required by Law, court process or stock exchange rule to be made by
the  party  proposing to issue the same, in which case such party shall use
its reasonable  commercial efforts to consult in good faith with the other
party prior to the  issuance of any such press release, announcement or
filing. In no event shall  either party disclose the Purchase Price for the
Membership Interests unless  compelled by court order or other legal process
and after prompt prior notice  to  the other party of any requested or
demanded disclosure. Seller will cooperate  with Buyer in respect of public
announcements and Seller will coordinate with  the Buyer regarding private
announcement of the transaction to the  employees.

shall be entitled to use the names of MPP and the Entities after  the Closing

Entities furnished to Buyer in connection with the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except to the extent that such  information can be shown
to have been (i) previously known on a non-confidential  basis by Buyer or
Seller, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of Buyer  or  Seller or
(iii) later lawfully acquired by Buyer or Seller from sources other  than the
other party; provided that Buyer and Seller may disclose such  information to
their Representatives in connection with the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement so long as such Persons are informed by Buyer  and  Seller
respectively of the confidential nature of such information and are  directed
by Buyer and Seller to treat such information confidentially. The  obligation
of each of Buyer and Seller to hold any such information in  confidence shall
be satisfied if it exercises the same care with respect to  such 
information as it would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own 
similar information.

_Section  5.11_ _Non-competition_.  For a  period beginning on the date
hereof and ending two (2) years after the Closing  Date (the " _Non-Compete

written  consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not  enter  into any settlement or compromise of any action,
suit or proceeding, or consent  to the entry of any judgment for relief other

time as additional  information regarding the First-Party Claim or the nature
or extent of Damages  resulting therefrom becomes available to the
Indemnified Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  45 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Any  failure to give such reasonably prompt notice or supplement thereto

Indemnifying  Party are actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 

 

(c) The  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt to
negotiate in  good  faith for a 30-day period regarding the resolution of
any disputed First-Party  Claim. Promptly following the final determination
of the amount of any Damages  Claimed by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the  limitations of the Threshold Amount and
the Cap Amount (if applicable), shall  pay such Damages to the Indemnified
Party by wire transfer of immediately  available funds.

 

 

_Section  6.6_ _Special  Indemnification Provision Relating to Environmental
Matters_.

by Buyer to Seller  during a period ending one year after the Closing Date.

 

 

Should  Seller be obligated, as a result of _Section  6.6(b)_   or due  to
any Retained Liability to conduct remediation, Buyer shall reasonably 
cooperate with environmental response activities of Seller on the applicable 
property. Buyer shall ensure that Seller has reasonable access to
investigate,  monitor, and remediate said property, and to install, operate,
and maintain  facilities for the containment or treatment of the soil and
groundwater, and  to  perform other environmental remediation and response
activities, so long as  such  activities do not unreasonably interfere with
the operation of the Business.  In  conducting the above-described
environmental remediation, Seller may elect  to  perform a cleanup in
accordance with applicable industrial cleanup standards  or  (if applicable
and suitable pursuant to Environmental Law in force at the time  of cleanup)
commercial III or IV cleanup standards under the Michigan Natural  Resources
and Environmental Protection Act, Part 201 (Part 201), or similar  standards
which may be allowed under Michigan law in the future. Seller shall  conduct
any and all investigations, monitoring, and remediation in compliance  with
applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) cleanup standards or cleanup criteria 
applicable to any remedial action by Seller at the property shall not be 
inconsistent in any way with current use of the subject property or
expansion  of  uses of a similar nature at the property; and Seller shall
access and disturb  the absolute least amount of surface property possible in
conducting it  remediation operations.
