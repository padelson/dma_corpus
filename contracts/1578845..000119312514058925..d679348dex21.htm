AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGERS

 

Section 1.1 _The Mergers_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL and the DLLCA, (a) at the First Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 shall be
merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Sub 1 will cease, with the Company surviving the First Merger (the Company,
as the surviving entity in the First Merger, sometimes being referred to
herein as the " _First Surviving Corporation_ "), such that following the
First Merger, the First Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned
direct subsidiary of US Holdco, and (b) immediately thereafter, and as part
of the same plan, at the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving
Corporation shall be merged with and into Merger Sub 2, whereupon the separate
existence of the First Surviving Corporation will cease, with Merger Sub 2
surviving the Second Merger (Merger Sub 2, as the surviving entity of the
Second Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving Company_
"), such that following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company will be a
wholly owned direct subsidiary of US Holdco. The Mergers shall have the
effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the DLLCA,
as applicable.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Latham and Watkins
LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, on the second (2nd) business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date
or place is agreed to in writing by 

 



2  the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually takes place
is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Times_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause
(a) a certificate of merger with respect to the First Merger (the " _First
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as
provided under the DGCL and the DLLCA and make any other filings, recordings
or publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub 1 under the
DGCL and the DLLCA in connection with the First Merger and (b) a certificate
of merger with respect to the Second Merger (the " _Second Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as provided under the
DGCL and the DLLCA and make any other filings, recordings or publications
required to be made by the First Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub 2 under
the DGCL and the DLLCA in connection with the Second Merger. The First
Merger shall become effective at such time as the First Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the DSOS or on such other date and time as shall be agreed
to by the Company and Parent and specified in the First Certificate of Merger
(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the " _First Effective
Time_ "). The Second Merger shall become effective at such time as the Second
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the DSOS or on such other date and
time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Second Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Second Effective Time_ "). The First Effective Time shall, in all
events, precede the Second Effective Time.

Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of
the First Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement of Merger Sub 2, as in effect immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time, shall be the certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company, until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of
such certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement.

 

Section 1.5 _Officers, Directors and Managers of the Surviving Entities_.

Time, from and after the First Effective Time, shall continue as the officers
of the First Surviving Corporation. The director of the First Surviving
Corporation shall be Paul M. Bisaro.

(b) The officers of the First Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time, from and after the Second Effective Time, shall be the
officers of the Surviving Company. The manager of Merger Sub 2 immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time shall be and become the manager of the
Surviving Company as of the Second Effective Time.

Section 1.6 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (a) the Mergers, taken together, shall (i) qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) not
result in gain being recognized by Persons who are

 



3  shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time
under Section 367(a) of the Code (other than any such shareholder that would
be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the Mergers that
does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form
provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8), and (b) this Agreement
be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or holders of any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub 1, subject to
_Section 2.1(e)_ and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms, conditions and procedures set
forth in this _Article II_ (including the proration procedures in _Section
2.2(c)_), the following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), in each case without interest: (i) the combination (such
election, a " _Mixed Election_ ") of (A) $26.04 in cash (the " _Mixed Cash
Consideration_ ") and (B) 0.3306 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Shares (the " _Mixed Stock Consideration_ " and together
with the Mixed Cash Consideration, the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ "),
(ii) (such election, a " _Cash Election_ ") $86.81 in cash (the " _Cash
Election Consideration_ "), or (iii) (such election, a " _Stock Election_ ")
0.4723 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (such number
of Parent Shares, the " _Stock Election Consideration_ "). From and after the
First Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.3_,
including the right to receive, pursuant to  _Section 2.7_, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock, if any, into which such Company Shares have
been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share
Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, all
Company Shares owned by any Company Subsidiary, Parent, US Holdco, the Merger
Subs or by any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub 1 Membership Interests_. At the First Effective
Time, each issued and outstanding membership interest of Merger Sub 1 (the "
_Merger Sub 1 Membership Interests_ ") shall be automatically converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the First Surviving Corporation. From and after the

 



4  First Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub 1 Membership
Interests shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or
holders of any securities of the First Surviving Corporation or of Merger Sub
2, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a
membership interest of the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common
stock of the First Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any
consideration being payable therefor.

(e)  _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to
the First Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Election and Proration Procedures_.

 

(a) An election form in such form as Parent shall reasonably specify and as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election Form_ ") shall
be mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company that is
not more than forty-five (45) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth (5th) business
day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").

(b) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(c) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(x) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder makes a Mixed Election (each such share, a " _Mixed
Election Share_ "); (y) the number of shares of such holders Company Common
Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election (each such
share, a " _Cash Election Share_ "); and (z) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Stock
Election (each such share, a " _Stock Election Share_ "). Any Company Shares
with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m.,

 



5  Eastern Time, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the Mailing Date (or
such other time and date as Parent and the Company shall agree) (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Proposed Dissenting Shares)
shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_ ," and the holders of such No
Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to
such No Election Shares. Not later than ten (10) business days after the
Election Deadline, unless the First Effective Time has not yet occurred, in
which case as soon after the First Effective Time as reasonably practicable,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the following prorations to
the Merger Consideration:

 

(i) If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election
Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (A) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the
Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "), and (B) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to
the product of the Stock Election Consideration, _multiplied by_ a fraction
equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 

(ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election
Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration, be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount
of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares, and (B) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares equal to
the product of the Stock Election Consideration _multiplied by_ a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration minus (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election
Consideration.

 

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the
authorized Person properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock prior to
the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly
or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

 



6 Section 2.3 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or
Merger Sub 1 shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as the exchange agent in connection with the First Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for
the Companys stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their
Election Forms and Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no
rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or immediately after
the First Effective Time, Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub 1 shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate Parent Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding
any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under 
_Section 2.3(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Stock and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section
2.3(f)_, Parent shall, or shall cause US Holdco or Merger Sub 1 to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery
of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_
out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company on the earlier of (A)
one (1) year after the First Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the
Exchange Fund.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause the Exchange
Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
First Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant
to  _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form

 



7  and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.7_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.3(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving
Company, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , any Fractional Share Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
2.7_, and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.3(f)_ for each Company Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for
collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5)
business days following the later to occur of (x) the First Effective Time or
(y) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_ , including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.3(f)_, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the First
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



8 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the First Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that
have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Company and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance
with  _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of
Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f),_ payable upon due surrender
of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures
in  _Section 2.3(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1
_hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Stock in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after
the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Stock
issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the First Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Stock.

Section 2.4 _Dissenter s Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held
by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Company Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the

 



9  DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_, but
instead at the First Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with
the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged that at the First
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the
Appraisal Rights); _provided, however_ , that if any such holder (including
any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the First Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Mixed Election
Consideration. " _Proposed Dissenting Shares_ " means shares of Company Common
Stock whose holders provide demands for appraisal to the Company prior to the
Company Special Meeting and do not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Appraisal Rights.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company relating to Appraisal Rights, and Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of the First Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any Company Equity Plan
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent
and shall be converted into a stock option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to
acquire Parent Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.5_. Each such Parent
Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time (but taking into account
any changes thereto provided for in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any
award agreement or in such Company Stock Option by reason of this Agreement
or the Transactions). As of the First Effective Time, each such Parent Stock
Option as so assumed and converted shall be for that number of whole shares of
Parent Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the Stock Election Consideration, at an
exercise price per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (y) the Stock
Election Consideration.

 



10 (b) As of the First Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock
(the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted under any Company Equity Plan
that is not then vested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into
a restricted stock unit award for Parent Stock (the " _Parent RSUs_ ")
in accordance with this _Section 2.5_. Each Parent RSU as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the applicable Company Restricted Shares immediately
prior to the First Effective Time (but taking into account any changes
thereto provided for in the applicable Company Equity Plan, in any award
agreement or in such Company Restricted Shares, by reason of this Agreement or
the Transactions). As of the First Effective Time, the number of shares of
Parent Stock underlying each such Parent RSU as so assumed and converted shall
be equal to the product of (i) the applicable number of Company Restricted
Shares _multiplied by_ (ii) the Stock Election Consideration.

(c) As of the First Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit and
any associated rights to the issuance of additional Company Common Stock upon
the achievement of Company performance goals (the " _Company RSUs_ ") under
any Company Equity Plan that is not then vested shall be assumed by Parent and
shall be converted into a Parent RSU with associated rights to the issuance
of additional shares of Parent Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.5_.
Each Parent RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the applicable
Company RSUs immediately prior to the First Effective Time (but taking into
account any changes thereto, including any necessary changes to any issuance
provisions, provided for or permitted in the applicable Company Equity Plan,
in any award agreement or in such Company RSUs, by reason of this Agreement or
the Transactions). To the extent any such Company RSUs are subject to
performance vesting, the applicable Parent RSUs corresponding to such
Company RSUs shall be earned based on target performance at the First
Effective Time, and shall otherwise remain subject to any applicable payment
conditions prescribed by the terms in effect for such Company RSUs immediately
prior to the First Effective Time. As of the First Effective Time, the number
of shares of Parent Stock underlying each such Parent RSU as so assumed and
converted shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying the applicable Company RSUs _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Stock Election Consideration.

(d) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as
are necessary for the treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Company RSUs (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.5_.

 

Section 2.6 _Withholding_. The Parent Entities, the First Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



11 Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
the First Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent
Stock _multiplied by_ the VWAP of Parent Stock.

or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or, where

right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject (in the case of the First Merger) to receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions, including
the Mergers. The execution

 



13  and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have
been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board of Directors and (in the
case of the First Merger, except for (i) receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval and (ii) the filing of the First Certificate of Merger with the DSOS)
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to

the Mergers, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (z) has adopted a
resolution to make, subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company Board
Recommendation. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable

is necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings
that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and,
except as described in _Section 3.3(b)_, the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in
any violation or breach of, or default or change of control (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or
result in, termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract,
loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise or right binding upon the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties, rights or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries, other than Company Permitted Liens, (ii) conflict with

14 Section 3.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) From April 1, 2011 through the date of this Agreement, the Company has
filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the " _Company SEC

(and giving effect to) the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents when filed
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited

described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ").

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in breach of or default under
the terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or default would
reasonably be

 



45  expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, no other
party to any Parent Material Contract is in breach of or default under the
terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each
Parent Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of Parent or the
Subsidiary of Parent which is party thereto and, to the knowledge of Parent,
of each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except that (i)
such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
examinership, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

Section 4.21 _Insurance_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as of the
date hereof, (a) all current, material insurance policies and Contracts of
Parent and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and are valid and
enforceable and cover against the risks as are customary in all material
respects for companies of similar size in the same or similar lines of
business and (b) all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of cancellation
or termination with respect to any material third party insurance policies or
Contracts (other than in connection with normal renewals of any such insurance
policies or Contracts) where such cancellation or termination would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 4.22 _Finders and Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in
connection with the Transactions, other than as set forth in _Section 4.22_
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, who might be entitled to any fee or
any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Mergers.

Section 4.23 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letters (redacted as to
economic terms only). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor
any of its affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other
arrangement relating to the financing of the Transactions, other than as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto that
could affect the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date. The
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and to the knowledge of Parent each other party thereto, to provide the
financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of
the Financing Conditions and, subject to the qualification that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are
discretionary and may not be ordered. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be
paid) any and all 

 



46  commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letter.
There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. Parent has no reason to
believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or
(ii) the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date.

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, in each case, solely to the extent the breach of such
representation, warranty or obligation would materially affect the
satisfaction by Parent of the Financing Conditions, Parent has, or will have
at Closing, all funds necessary to consummate the Transactions, including the
making of all required payments in connection with the Transactions, including
payment of the Merger Consideration and Fractional Share Consideration and all
other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and
expenses of the Transactions on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the receipt or availability
of any funds or financing by Parent or any of its affiliates be a condition
to any of Parent, US Holdco, or the Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

Section 4.24 _FCPA and Anti-Corruption_. Except for those matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect:

 

(a) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or
employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has in the last five (5) years,
in connection with the business of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, itself or,
to Parents knowledge, any of its agents, representatives, sales
intermediaries, or any other third party, in each case, acting on behalf of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, taken any action in violation of the FCPA or
other applicable Bribery Legislation (in each case to the extent applicable);

 

(b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary, nor any director, manager or
employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, are, or in the past five (5)
years have been, subject to any actual, pending, or threatened civil,

of violation, investigations, proceedings, demand letters, settlements, or
enforcement actions, or made any voluntary disclosures to any Governmental
Entity, involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in any way relating to
applicable Bribery Legislation, including the FCPA;

 

(c) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has made and kept books and records,
accounts and other records, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Parent
and each Parent Subsidiary as required by the FCPA in all material respects;

 



47 (d) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has instituted policies and procedures
designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and other applicable Bribery
Legislation and maintain such policies and procedures in force; and

(e) no officer, director, or employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a
Government Official.

Section 4.25 _Stock Ownership_. Parent is not, nor at any time for the past
three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiaries directly
or indirectly owns, and at all times for the past three years, neither Parent
nor any Parent Subsidiaries has owned, beneficially or otherwise, any shares
of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 4.26 _No US Holdco or Merger Sub Activity_. Since the date of their
formation, US Holdco and the Merger Subs have not engaged in any activities
other than in connection with this Agreement.

Section 4.27 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ , Parent acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any Representative of the Company makes, and Parent acknowledges
that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or made
available to Parent in connection with the Transactions, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Parent or to Parents Representatives in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Transactions.

of the Company, is considering making a Company Competing Proposal of the
provisions of this _Section 5.3_.

Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result, after the
taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below,
in a Company Superior Proposal, then in either event (if the Company has not
materially breached the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ (1) with respect to
such Company Competing Proposal or (2) in a manner that otherwise related to
such Company Competing Proposal) the Company may take the following actions:

information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person
who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any Company Competing
Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and

following receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited, written Company
Competing Proposal, which the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors is a Company Superior Proposal, in each case with respect to clauses

facilitate such Company Competing Proposal as a result of a material breach of
the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and (y) the Company Board of Directors
has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside

of the duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors under
applicable Law and the Company complies with _Section 5.3(e)_.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in

Agreement such that such Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute
a Company Superior Proposal.

Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would
constitute a breach of the duties of the members of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall
not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by  _Section 5.3(d)_ or

its obligations to submit the adoption of this Agreement to a vote of its
stockholders at the Company Special Meeting.

proposal made by any Person solely to determine whether such inquiry or
proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge
of Parent, is considering making a Parent Competing Proposal of the provisions

Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus

Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the

Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of

 



60  Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or
not a quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Special Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a
date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company
Special Meeting was originally scheduled (other than any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law, including adjournments or
postponements to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
is provided or made available to the Company stockholders or to permit
dissemination of information which is material to stockholders voting at the

obligations to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the

provisions of this _Section 5.5(d)_, if, on a date for which the
Parent Special Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Stock to obtain the
Parent Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall
have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments
of the Parent Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Special Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after

Statement/Prospectus is provided or made available to the Parent shareholders
or to permit dissemination of information which is material to stockholders
voting at the Parent Special Meeting and to give the Parent
shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or
other information). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the issuance of the Parent Stock in
the First Merger to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof.

to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the
same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this

executing all such documents and paying all such fees as may be
reasonably necessary or required by the CBI for the purposes of obtaining
such approval. If any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set
forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Irish Prospectus so that it
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the CBI of

procure that the directors of Parent publish the Irish Prospectus in
accordance with applicable Law. Parent shall promptly advise the Company upon
becoming aware of (i) the time when the Irish Prospectus has been approved by

Prospectus Regulations which arises between the time that the Irish Prospectus
is formally approved and Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Irish Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the CBI with respect thereto, Parent shall
cooperate with the Company and provide the Company a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the
proposed final version of such document or response).

consummating any transaction that (i) is described in clause (a), _(b)_ ,
_(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ or _(j)_ of _Section 5.1(ii)_ and (ii) is not
subject to Parents consent right provided in _Section 5.1(ii)_ on the basis
that such transaction involves solely the Company and one or more Company
Subsidiaries or solely Company Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any intercompany
arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among the Company and
its wholly owned Subsidiaries or among the Companys wholly owned
Subsidiaries, the Company shall consult with Parent reasonably prior to
consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed with any such action
or transaction described in clause (a) or (b) hereof without Parents consent
(not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if such action or
transaction would, without taking into account any action or transaction
entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the First
Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), reasonably be
expected to have adverse Tax consequences that, individually or in the
aggregate, are material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or,
after the First Effective Time, to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent,
(ii) of any legal proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge,
threatened against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or
otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Mergers or any other Transaction, (iii) in the case
of Parent, of any notice or other communication received by Parent from any
Person requisitioning the convening of a meeting of the holders of Parent
Stock and (iv) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence
of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_  or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article VIII_.

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Mergers and the other Transactions as soon
as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing,
in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as practicable and
advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations,
consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Mergers
or any of the other Transactions and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
Party agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly
as practicable, and in any event within twenty (20) business days after the
execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed between
the Parties), and to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations,
approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any

 



64  investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by promptly providing copies
to the other Party of any such written communications, and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call
or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person (
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent, Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns), and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other
applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ,
the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or other Person. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in _Section
6.2(a)_ and this _Section 6.2(b)_, each Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law including agreeing to any terms,
conditions or modifications (including Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries having to cease operating, license, sell or otherwise
dispose of any assets or businesses (including the requirement that any such
assets or businesses be held separate)) with respect to obtaining the
expiration or termination of any waiting period or any consents, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required to take such actions under this Section 6.2(b) that would
result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, either individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parent, Company and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Mergers.
Nothing in this Section 6.2(b) shall require Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to
its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing. Parent shall, on behalf of the
Parties, control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the
Antitrust Laws (provided that the Company is not constrained from complying
with applicable Law), provided, further, that the Parties shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, regarding the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made
or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their submission.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including
Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of
the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided prior to the First Effective Time; _provided_ that, without the
prior

 



65  written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur any significant
expense or liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement
or agree to any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to
obtain such consents or certificates in each case, that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Prior to asserting the failure of any condition in Section 7.1(c) with
respect to clause (iii) of the definition of Adverse Law or Order, Parent
shall use best efforts to obtain the affirmation of the PwC Opinion, and shall
make itself readily available to consult in good faith with, and consider in
good faith the views of, the Company and its representatives (who shall have
an opportunity to meet with PwC) in the exercise of such best efforts, and
shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of its communications with PwC
relating to the affirmation of the PwC Opinion.

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Mergers or this Agreement without the prior consent of the
other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading
market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to the Mergers or this Agreement, in which event
such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment
upon such press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection
with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a Company
Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto; _provided, further_ ,
that Parent shall not be required by this _Section 6.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to the Company in connection with the receipt and existence
of a Parent Competing Proposal or a Parent Change of Recommendation and
matters related thereto; _provided, further_ , each Party and their respective
affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the
Company in compliance with this _Section 6.3_.

Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For
not less than six (6) years from and after the First Effective Time, Parent
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; provided such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring
or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this 

 



66  Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First
Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing
Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect. For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the
Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide, for an aggregate period of not less
than six (6) years from the First Effective Time, the Companys current
directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the First Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy or,
if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Company
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess
of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may prior
to the First Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage
with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the
final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The rights and
obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of the
Mergers and

 



67  shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and
the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Obligations of US Holdco and Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause US Holdco, each of the Merger Subs, the First
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including
the Mergers, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume, honor and
fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as subsequently
amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans.
Effective as of the First Effective Time and for a period of no less than
one (1) year thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide, to each employee of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed by the Parent or the Surviving Company or any
Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) compensation
(including, without limitation, cash incentive compensation opportunities, but
excluding any equity-based compensation), that is not less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent, and (ii) employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, that periods of
employment with the Company (including any current or former affiliate of the
Company or any predecessor of the Company) shall be taken into account for
all purposes under all employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an
affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including
vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or
other retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other
than for purposes of determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit
pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits).

 

(b) Effective as of the First Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting
periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations
or exclusions shall apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under the
applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any affiliate
of Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the First Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing
Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability

 



68  requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the
Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and (iii)
credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket
or other co-payments paid by such employee under the Company Benefit Plans
prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied
his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for
such year. The Mergers shall not affect any Continuing Employees accrual
of, or right to use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or
other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the First Effective Time.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company
or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company or any affiliate
of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other
applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section
6.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of any of
the Merger Subs, or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or
former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.8 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent
equity securities pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.9 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that
Party against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective directors relating to the Mergers, this Agreement or any of the
Transactions. Unless (i) in the case of such litigation with respect to the
Company, the Company Board of Directors has made or is considering making a
Company Change of Recommendation or (ii) in the case of such litigation with
respect to Parent, the Parent Board of Directors has made or is considering
making a Parent Change of Recommendation, each Party shall give the other
Party the opportunity to participate (at such other Partys expense) in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the other Partys prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that the other Party shall not
be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full
release of such other Party and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction
or other equitable relief after the First Effective Time upon Parent or any of
its

 



69  affiliates. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and _Section 5.1_, _Section
5.2_ or Section 6.2, the provisions of this _Section 6.9 _shall control.

Section 6.10 _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until after the First Effective Time.

Section 6.11 _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and effective upon the First Effective Time.

 

Section 6.12 _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to result
in no gain being recognized by Persons who are shareholders of the Company
immediately prior to the First Effective Time under Section 367(a) of the
Code (other than any such shareholder that would be a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the Mergers that does not enter into
a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8), including by executing and delivering tax
representation letters to the Companys and/or Parents counsel, as
applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, in
connection with (i) any tax opinion or description of the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Mergers contained or set forth in the Form S-4 or (ii)
any tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Mergers requested by the Company from its advisors in connection with the
Closing of the Mergers. None of the Parties shall (and each of the Parties
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to
take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Mergers, taken
together, to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or to result in gain being recognized by Persons who are
shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time
under Section 367(a) of the Code (other than any shareholder that would be a
"five-percent transferee shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the Mergers that
does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form
provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8). The Parties intend to
report and, except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for
federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together (i) as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) as
a transaction in which no gain is recognized by Persons who are shareholders
of the Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time under Section
367(a) of the Code (other than any such shareholder that would be a "five-
percent transferee shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the Mergers that does not
enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8), and, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, no Party shall take any positions inconsistent therewith for
Tax purposes.

 



70 Section 6.13 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the First Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the First Effective Time.

 

Section 6.14 _The Company s Financing Cooperation_. The Company agrees to,
and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such
assistance (and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective personnel and advisors to provide such assistance) with the
Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent, including using reasonable
best efforts with respect to: (a) participation in, and assistance with, the
marketing efforts related to the Financing; (b) participation by senior
management of the Company in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders
and debt investors; (c) delivery to Parent and its Financing Sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable of the Financing Deliverables, the
Financing Information and such financial information relating to the Company
customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the preparation of
customary offering or information documents to be used for the Financing; (d)
cause its independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing consistent with
their customary practice, including by providing customary "comfort letters"
(including customary "negative assurances") and customary assistance with the
due diligence activities of Parent and the Financing Sources, and customary
consents to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant marketing
materials, registration statements and related government filings; (e)
ensuring that the Financing benefits from the existing lending relationships
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company hereby consents to
the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in
any other agreement between the Company and Parent (or its affiliates), the
Company agrees that Parent and its affiliates may share customary projections
with respect to the Company and its business with the Financing Sources
identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that Parent, its affiliates and
such Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing
Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the
Financing, provided that the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective directors or officers or other personnel shall be required by
this _Section 6.14_ (i) to take any action or provide any assistance that
unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing or the Debt Financing Documents; or (iii) to
execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is
effective prior to the Closing or agree to any change or modification of any
existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is effective
prior to the Closing (other than a payoff letter with respect to the Credit
Agreement). Parent shall (1) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section 6.14_ and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company 

 



71  and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers,
personnel and advisors from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the
Financing or any assistance or activities in connection therewith.

 

Section 6.15 _Parent s Financing Cooperation_. Parent shall take, or use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and do, or use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain
the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including: (a) maintaining in effect and
enforcing the Debt Commitment Letter and complying with its obligations
thereunder; (b) participation by senior management of Parent in, and
assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings
with rating agencies; (c) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to the
Financing (including the Financing Conditions) that are within Parents
control; (d) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto); and (e) drawing the full amount of
the Financing, in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and  _Section 7.2_ and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon
funding would be satisfied. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any
breach or threatened breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of
which Parent becomes aware. Without limiting Parents other obligations under
this _Section 6.15_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs Parent shall (i)
immediately notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (ii) in consultation with the Company, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources on
terms (including conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing) not
materially less beneficial in the aggregate to the Company and Parent, with
lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the
Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such
alternative financing. Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent, agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Document unless the terms and conditions thereof, as so amended, modified or
waived, are in the aggregate at least as favorable to the Company and Parent
as those contained therein prior to giving effect to such amendment,
modification or waiver; _provided_ that, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the following amendments, modifications and waivers shall be
understood to result in terms and conditions that are in the aggregate less
favorable to the Company and Parent: (i) any amendment, modification or waiver
that could reasonably be expected to (x) materially adversely affect the
ability of Parent, US Holdco, or the Merger Subs to timely consummate the
Transactions or (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur, (ii) any amendment, modification or waiver to the conditions to
obtaining the Financing, unless such amendment, modification or waiver results
in conditions that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent (or that are
more favorable to the Company and Parent), (iii) any amendment, modification
or waiver that reduces the amount of the Financing or (iv) any amendment,
modification or waiver that materially adversely affects the ability of Parent
or its affiliates to enforce their rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or such Debt Financing Documents. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Subs may replace or amend the
Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not

 



72  executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
its efforts to obtain the Financing. 

Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including unsecured notes) for all or

than) the Financing Conditions, and (ii) prior to funding of any loans
thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are subject to
restrictions on assignment which are in the aggregate substantially
equivalent to or more favorable to the Company than the corresponding
restrictions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (any such debt or equity
financing which satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive documentation for any such
Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing Documents_ "). The
representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of Parent,

pay a fee of $1,175,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Solely
for purposes of this  _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, the term "Parent Competing

except that all references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references

Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that (i) the
Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount

the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) the Parent Termination Fee is not
a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company
in the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, each of which amounts would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of Willful Breach, (A) upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, none
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,

95 Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates"
shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The table
of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein
to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the Parties, in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered
to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof,
Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Subs shall be permitted to take the actions
contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

(b) Except (i) as provided in _Section 6.4_ and the last sentence of 
_Section 6.14 _and (ii) the right of the Company, on behalf of its
stockholders, to pursue damages in the event of Parents, US Holdcos or the
Merger Subs Willful Breach of this Agreement, neither this
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_
that the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 9.9(b)_ and _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 9.11(a)(2)_, _Section
9.11(b)(2)_, and _Section 9.15_, and each of such Sections shall
expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing
Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such
Sections.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

 



96  economic or legal substance of the Mergers is not affected in any manner
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Mergers are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a)(1) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.
(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of
itself and each Company Related Party) and each of the other Parties hereto
agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether
based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against a Financing Source that is in
any way related to this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles (other
than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law);
_provided_ that (i) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred, (ii) the determination of the accuracy of any Merger Agreement
Representations (as defined in any commitment letter related to the Financing)
and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent, US Holdco, the
Merger Subs or their respective affiliates have the right to terminate its
obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to consummate the Transactions
pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the determination of whether the
Transactions have been consummated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state.

(b) (1) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto

 



97  agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 9.11(b)(1)_ in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law. (2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company (on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party) and each of
the other Parties hereto (A) agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other Transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than
exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York,
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and appellate courts thereof), (B) submits for itself and its property
with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts,
(C) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 9.4_ shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, (D) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (E) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGERS, THE FINANCING AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.12_.

Section 9.13  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, except that US Holdco and Merger Subs
may assign, in their sole discretion and without the consent of any other
party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i)
Parent, (ii) Parent and one or more direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one or more direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_ , that no such

 



98  assignment shall be permitted without the prior written consent of the other
Parties if such assignment could adversely affect the intended tax
consequences of the Mergers described in  _Section 1.6_, delay the Closing,
increase the risk that any of the conditions set forth in Article VII may not
be timely satisfied, result in a breach of any of covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement or adversely affect the Company; provided, further,
that no such assignment shall relieve any Parent Entity of any obligation or
liability under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order
of specific performance specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this Section 9.14 are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this Section 9.14 (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this Section 9.14, such Party shall not be required to obtain,
furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with or as
a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

Section 9.15 _Liability of Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company (on behalf of itself and each
Company Related Party (other than Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Subs))
agrees that neither it nor any other Company Related Party (other than
Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Subs) shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall
have any rights or claims against any Company Related Party (other than
Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Subs) in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, following
consummation of the Mergers, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the
parties to the Financing under the Debt Financing Documents. In addition, in
no event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential, special,
exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits,
business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature.
