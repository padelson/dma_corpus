any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the
DGCL, shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares or lost
his right to appraisal and payment for his shares of Company Common Stock under <U>Section&nbsp;262</U>
of DGCL, (ii)&nbsp;if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;262</U> of the DGCL, or (iii)&nbsp;if any holder of
Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is
not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be)
shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such Company Common
Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each of such holders&#146; shares of
Company Common Stock shall be converted solely into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Company shall give Cal Dive prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of shares of Company Common Stock, and Cal Dive shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any
payments with respect to, or offer to settle any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without
the prior written consent of Cal Dive.

vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall

the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option pursuant to
the relevant Company Stock Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the
grant thereof prior to the Effective Time, each as amended by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U>) the

Dive Common Stock subject to any such Converted Cal Dive Option shall be an amount (rounded
up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to (A)&nbsp;the exercise price or base price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (B)&nbsp;the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Company Stock Option which is an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; (as defined in
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section
424 of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the
terms of the Company Stock Plans and underlying agreements as are necessary to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(a)</U>, including amending each
agreement evidencing a Converted Cal Dive Option to provide that, as of the Effective Time,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of Horizon
Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<B><I>Company</I></B>&#148;), as the term &#147;affiliate&#148; is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and Regulations (the &#147;<B><I>Rules and
Regulations</I></B>&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<B><I>Commission</I></B>&#148;) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
&#147;<B><I>Securities Act</I></B>&#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June&nbsp;11,
2007 (the &#147;<B><I>Merger Agreement</I></B>&#148;), by and among the Company, Cal Dive International, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (&#147;<B><I>Cal Dive</I></B>&#148;), and Cal Dive Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cal Dive
(&#147;<B><I>Merger Sub</I></B>&#148;), the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, in consideration of cash and
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cal Dive (&#147;<B><I>Cal Dive Common Stock</I></B>&#148;), with
Merger Sub as the surviving limited liability company (the &#147;<B><I>Merger</I></B>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant, and covenant to Cal Dive and Merger Sub that in the event I receive any
Cal Dive Common Stock as a result of the Merger:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Cal Dive Common Stock
acquired by me in the Merger in violation of the Securities Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Cal
Dive Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Cal Dive and
Merger Sub.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Cal Dive Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger
has been or will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration
Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that, because at the time the Merger
will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be an affiliate
of the Company (without anything in this letter agreement being an admission of such fact), the
distribution by me of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be registered
under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any Cal Dive
Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition has
been registered under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Securities Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Cal Dive such sale,
transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

Dive&#146;s transfer agent) without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Cal Dive a
copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Cal Dive, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of
the Securities Act.
