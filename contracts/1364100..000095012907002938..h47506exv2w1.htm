 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 11, 2007 (this _"Agreement"_ ), is by and among CAL DIVE INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware corporation ( _"Cal Dive"_ ), CAL DIVE ACQUISITION LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Cal Dive ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and HORIZON OFFSHORE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the _"Company"_ ). 

  

W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Parties intend to effect a strategic business combination through the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), with the Merger Sub being the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Cal Dive and the Company, and the sole member of Merger Sub, have each approved the Merger and this Agreement and the plan of merger contained in this Agreement (the " _Plan of Merger_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

  

THE MERGER

    

 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the Surviving Company in the Merger, and the separate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. As a result of and immediately after the Merger, Merger Sub will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Cal Dive. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the  _"Certificate of Merger"_ ), which filing shall be made as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger. The Certificate of Merger shall be in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the DGCL and the DLLCA, and as mutually agreed by Cal Dive and the Company. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. 

  

 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the  _"Closing"_ ) will take place at the offices of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 1301 McKinney, Houston, Texas 77010 as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two Business Days) following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_, other than those 

   ##### 

  

    

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject
to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions (the _"Closing Date"_ ). 

  

 1.5 _Certificate of Formation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 

  

 1.6 _Limited Liability Company Agreement_. At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 

  

 1.7 _Managers and Officers_. The managers and officers of Merger Sub shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the initial managers and officers of the Surviving Company until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed, or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company. 

  

ARTICLE II 

  

CONSIDERATION/ EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

    

 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holder of any of their securities: 

   

 (a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than Exception Shares (which shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made with respect thereto) and Dissenting Shares (which shares shall be treated in accordance with _Section 2.2_) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration, without interest (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "): 

   

Each share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive the combination of (x) $9.25 in cash (the _"Per Share Cash Amount"_ )
and (y) 0.625 of a share of validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable
shares of Cal Dive Common Stock (the _"Exchange Ratio"_ ), subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each a _"Certificate"_ ) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Cal Dive Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.5_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Cal Dive or the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio, and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, all Exception Shares, if any, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Cal Dive, cash, or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall not apply to shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside from shares held in the Companys treasury pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan other than a Company Stock Plan. 

   

 (e) Each issued and outstanding membership interest of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become an equivalent fully paid and nonassessable membership interest of the Surviving Company. 

  

 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in the manner provided by the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (each, a _"Dissenting Share"_ ), if any, such share will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Company, of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 262_ of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his shares of Company Common Stock under _Section 262_ of DGCL, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in _Section 262_ of the DGCL, or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each of such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted solely into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Cal Dive prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Cal Dive shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Cal Dive. 

   ##### 

  

  

2.3 _Stock Options and Equity Awards_. 

   

 (a) The Board of Directors of the Company shall take such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a _"Company Stock Option"_ ) granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall thereafter constitute a fully vested option (a _"Converted Cal Dive Option"_ ) to acquire (on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option pursuant to the relevant Company Stock Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to the Effective Time, each as amended by this _Section 2.3_) the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Cal Dive Common Stock determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price or base price per share of Cal Dive Common Stock subject to any such Converted Cal Dive Option shall be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to (A) the exercise price or base price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Plans and underlying agreements as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_, including amending each agreement evidencing a Converted Cal Dive Option to provide that, as of the Effective Time, any reference to the Company shall be deemed a reference to Cal Dive and any reference to Company Common Stock shall be deemed a reference to Cal Dive Common Stock. 

  

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall vest, and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company incentive award or other compensatory award shall have any right to receive shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such award. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (or its Board of Directors or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take all corporate action necessary for the adjustment of Company Stock Options contemplated by this _Section 2.3_. Cal Dive shall take all corporate action necessary to assume as of the Effective Time the Companys obligations with respect to the Converted Cal Dive Options and to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Cal Dive Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Converted Cal Dive Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this _Section 2.3_. 

   ##### 

  

  

2.4 _Surrender and Payment_. 

   

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Cal Dive shall appoint Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. or such other exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Cal Dive and the Company (the _"Exchange Agent"_ ) for the purpose of payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Cal Dive shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, (a) cash and (b) certificates representing shares of Cal Dive Common Stock, to be paid and issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.3(a)_ and _(b),_ and pursuant to _Section 2.5_ in respect of fractional shares of Cal Dive Common Stock. Any cash and certificates representing Cal Dive Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including cash in lieu of fraction shares to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.5_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the _"Exchange Fund."_ Promptly after the Effective Time, Cal Dive will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Cal Dive may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange of any book-entry shares shall be effected in accordance with Cal Dives customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted shares) that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (i) one or more shares of Cal Dive Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Cal Dive Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and this _Article II_, including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to or registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment or the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company, or Cal Dive, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Cal Dive upon demand, and any holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Cal Dive for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, Cal Dive, or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares for any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.4_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Cal Dive, upon demand. 

  

 2.5 _No Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional share of Cal Dive Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder, upon surrender of a Company Certificate as described in _Section 2.4_, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Market Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Cal Dive Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. 

  

 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Cal Dive or the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

  

 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company and Cal Dive shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to  _Article II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local, or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving Company or Cal Dive, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or other Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company or Cal Dive, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Cal Dive Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _2.5_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 2.9 _Investment of Cash by the Exchange Agent_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Cal Dive, provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to the other provisions of this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Cal Dive. Such funds shall be invested in short term investments in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest or commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors or a combination thereof as directed by Cal Dive. 

  

 2.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Company, Merger Sub, or the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Company, Merger Sub, or the Company, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect, or confirm of record or otherwise in Cal Dive or the Surviving Company any and all right, title, and interest in, to, and under any of the rights, properties, or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 2.11 _Shares Held by Company Affiliates_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no shares of Cal Dive Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any Affiliate of the Company (identified pursuant to _Section 5.10)_ until such Person shall have delivered to Cal Dive duly executed letters as contemplated by _Section 5.10_. Such Persons shall be subject to the restrictions described in such letters. 

  

ARTICLE III 

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    

 3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule (subject to the last sentence of _Section 9.3(a)_) or, in the case of  _Sections 3.1(f) _\- _(o)_ , in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Cal Dive as follows: 

   

(a) _Corporate Organization_. 

   

 (i) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business 

   ##### 

  

 

conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, as amended and in effect as of

this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board
of Directors (I) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect its

material weaknesses in internal controls and (II) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Cal Dive and the Company agrees to prepare, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and to make (A) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) all other necessary filings with other Governmental Entities relating to the Merger at such time as Cal Dive and the Company reasonably determine in their good faith judgment will permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely basis, and, to prepare and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to such laws or by such Governmental Entities, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of Required Approvals under such other laws or from such third parties and Governmental Entities as soon as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Cal Dive and the Company agrees not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC or the DOJ not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Other Party. 

   

 (b) The Parties shall each cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the actions referenced in _Section 5.3(a)_ to obtain all Required Approvals. In particular, each Party shall to the extent permitted by law (i) furnish to the Other Party as promptly as reasonably practicable any information concerning such Party and its business, properties, and personnel as the Other Party may reasonably request in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) permit the Other Party to review in advance, and accept all of the Other Partys reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed written communication between it and any Governmental Entity. In addition, each Party shall (i) promptly inform the Other Party of any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a 

   ##### 

  

 

private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) consult with the Other Party in advance, to the extent
practicable and not prohibited by law, of any meeting or conference with the
DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC, or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the Other Party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences. 

   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in  _Sections 5.3(a)_ and _5.3(b)_ , if Cal Dive and the Company agree, they shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend all litigation under the federal or state antitrust laws of the United States which if adversely determined would, in the reasonable opinion of Cal Dive and the Company (based on the advice of outside counsel to each), be likely to result in the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ to be satisfied, and to appeal any order, judgment or decree, which if not reversed, would result in the failure of such condition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to require Cal Dive, Merger Sub, or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to sell, license, dispose of, or hold separate, or to operate in any specified manner, any assets or businesses of Cal Dive, Merger Sub, the Company, or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or to require Cal Dive, Merger Sub, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to any of the foregoing). The obligations of each Party under _Section 5.3(a)_ to use its reasonable best efforts with respect to antitrust matters shall be limited to compliance with the reporting provisions of the HSR Act and with its obligations under this _Section 5.3(c)_. 

  

 (d) Each Party hereto and its respective Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (prevailing Central time) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ _")_ , shall have the right to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, encourage, or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to or the making or implementation of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) continue or otherwise engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions with any third party, with respect to, Acquisition Proposals, including providing or otherwise making available information to any Person, provided that, prior to doing so, such third party has entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company; provided further, that all such 

   ##### 

  

    

information (to the extent such information has not been previously provided
or otherwise made available to Cal Dive) is provided or otherwise made
available to Cal Dive substantially concurrently with the time it is provided
or otherwise made available to such Person subject to the right of the
Company to withhold such portions of information relating to pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such information, as
reasonably determined by the Companys outside legal counsel, would be
reasonably likely to result in antitrust difficulties for the Company or in
connection with the Merger; and (iii) release any third party from, or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is
a party to the extent necessary to permit the Company to conduct the activity
set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above; provided that the Company
will promptly (in any event within one calendar day) notify Cal Dive of its
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal including the general terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, and will keep Cal Dive apprised of the status of any
such Acquisition Proposal. Within two Business Days following the beginning
of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Cal Dive of the
number of Excluded Parties and the material terms and conditions of
each Excluded Parties Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.4_,
the Company shall not be required to provide the identity of any Excluded
Party or other Person who has submitted an Acquisition Proposal unless and
until the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with  _Section
7.1(h)_. 

  

 (b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4_ and except with respect to any Excluded Party, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Company Representatives to, (i) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_, not (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to or the making or implementation of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in any negotiations or substantive discussions with, or provide or otherwise make available any information to any third party relating to a Acquisition Proposal, (C) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, or similar agreement with any Person relating to a Acquisition Proposal, or (D) release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the Company may in any event have discussions with any Person that has made a written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof solely in order to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.4_ but subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and provided the Company and the Company Representatives shall not have materially violated any of the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 5.4_, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of 

   ##### 

  

    

nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may, after
giving Cal Dive prompt notice of such determination (which notice shall
indicate the identity of the Person and the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal), (i) engage or participate in negotiations or
discussions relating to such Acquisition Proposal with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives), provided that the
Company shall keep Cal Dive apprised of the status and material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) provide or otherwise make available
information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
representatives) only pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that all such information (to the extent such information has not
been previously provided or otherwise made available to Cal Dive) is provided
or otherwise made available to Cal Dive substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or otherwise made available to such Person subject to the
right of the Company to withhold such portions of information relating to
pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such
information, as reasonably determined by the Companys outside legal counsel,
would be reasonably likely to result in antitrust difficulties for the
Company or in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties agree that, notwithstanding the commencement of the No-Shop
Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities
described in _Section 5.4(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Parties, including
with respect to any amended proposal submitted by such Excluded Parties
following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in this
_Section 5.4(c)_ shall not apply with respect thereto, provided that to the
extent applicable to an Excluded Party, the provisions of _Section
5.4(d)_ shall apply. 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) effect a Change in the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or cause the Company to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, or similar agreement with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines, in its good faith judgment, that failure to take such action would constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company may, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, (A) enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, if (I) the Company and the Company Representatives shall not have materially violated this _Section 5.4_ and (II) such action is in response to a Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors has determined, in its good faith judgment, constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (III) the Company, concurrently with the entering into of such definitive agreement, terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ and pays the fee required by _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, and/or (B) effect a Change in the Company Board Recommendation; provided, that prior to such action, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have given Cal Dive at least three Business Days prior written notice that the Company intends to take such action. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act; or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party; provided that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors, nor any committee thereof, shall approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal unless the Company has first terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ hereof and paid the fee required by _Section 7.2(b)(i)_. 

  

 5.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Section 7.2_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party hereto incurring such Expenses, except (a) Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing, and mailing, but not preparation, of the Information Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 and (b) Expenses incurred in connection with any consultants that Cal Dive and the Company shall have agreed to retain to assist in obtaining the approvals and clearances under the Antitrust Laws, which, in each case, shall be shared equally by Cal Dive and the Company.

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Cal Dive and the Surviving Company shall (i) jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (A) without limitation to subclause (B) below, to the same extent such individuals are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with, or for the benefit of, any such individuals and (B) without limitation to subclause (A) above, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company (or any successor to the Surviving Company) for a period of six years after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors or managers, indemnification of officers, directors, managers, and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company. After the Effective Time, Cal Dive shall cause the Surviving Company to obtain and fully pay (up to a maximum aggregate cost not to exceed $1,000,000 for such six-year period) for "tail" insurance policies (including Side A coverage for such covered individuals) with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the 

   ##### 

  

   

Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The obligations of Cal Dive and the Surviving Company under this _Section 5.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies without the prior written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this  _Section 5.6_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_).

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the _"Old Plans"_ ); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Cal Dive shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Cal Dive shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, in its discretion, adopt a cash incentive plan, which may constitute a Company Benefit Plan, intended to retain in the employ of the Company certain individuals identified by the Company as key to the continued operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that such plan shall be subject to the prior approval of Cal Dive, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

written consent of the Other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Cal Dive and the
Company shall be entitled to respond to questions from stockholders, respond
to inquiries from financial analysts and media representatives in a manner
consistent with its past practice and make such disclosure as may be required

 9.3 _Interpretation_. 

   

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits, or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof" or "hereunder," and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section. In addition, each Section of this Agreement is qualified by the matters set forth in the related Section of the Cal Dive Disclosure Schedule and the Company Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, and by such matters set forth any place else in this Agreement or in the Cal Dive Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure Schedule where the applicability of such qualification to the Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent. 

   

 (b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the Other Party, it being understood that the Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

   

 (a) This Agreement (and the Confidentiality Agreement) and the Exhibits and disclosure schedules and the other agreements and instruments of the Parties delivered in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject 

   ##### 

  

   

matter hereof. The Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms, except for paragraph 9 thereof which is
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 5.6_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby). 

  

 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof). 

  

 9.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by a Party in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the Other Party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 9.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each Party irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the Other Party shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the Court of Chancery) and to accept service of process in any manner permitted by such courts. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, 

   ##### 

  

    

action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and (d) any right to
a trial by jury. 

  

 9.10 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the mutual written agreement of the Parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 

  

 9.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

    ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Cal Dive, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date first written above.

 _Exhibit A_ 

   

FORM OF AFFILIATE AGREEMENT 

   

 _ _, 2007  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Horizon Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Company, Cal Dive International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Cal Dive_ "), and Cal Dive Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cal Dive (" _Merger Sub_ "), the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, in consideration of cash and shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cal Dive (" _Cal Dive Common Stock_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving limited liability company (the " _Merger_ "). 

  

 I represent, warrant, and covenant to Cal Dive and Merger Sub that in the event I receive any Cal Dive Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

 A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger in violation of the Securities Act. 

  

 B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Cal Dive Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Cal Dive and Merger Sub. 

  

 C. I have been advised that the issuance of Cal Dive Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that, because at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company (without anything in this letter agreement being an admission of such fact), the distribution by me of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act and that I may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer, or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer, or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Cal Dive such sale, transfer, or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 D. I understand that Cal Dive is under no obligation to register under the Securities Act the sale, transfer, or other disposition by me or on my behalf of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order to make an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 E. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Cal Dives transfer agent with respect to Cal Dive Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates (or in the case of shares issued in book-entry form, an appropriate notation of the records of Cal Dives transfer agent) for any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger, or any substitutions therefore, a legend stating in substance: 

   

 "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 may apply. The shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, including, without limitation, Rule 145 promulgated thereunder, or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom." 

  

 F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Cal Dive Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Cal Dive reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

 "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933." 

  

 G. It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in paragraphs E and F above shall be removed by the delivery of substitute certificates (or change in notation on the records of Cal Dives transfer agent) without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Cal Dive a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Cal Dive, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act. 

  

 I understand that (a) Cal Dive will supply me with any information necessary to enable me to make routine sales of any Cal Dive Common Stock acquired by me in the Merger as may be permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar rule of the Commission hereafter applicable, and (b) Cal Dive will comply with all requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), with respect to the filing by Cal Dive of annual, periodic and other reports on a timely basis in a manner sufficient to allow sales of any such Cal Dive Common Stock by me during the two year period following the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) if such sales are otherwise permitted by law or regulation. Upon my written 

   ##### 

  

    

request, Cal Dive shall furnish me with a written statement representing that
it has complied with the reporting requirements enumerated in Rule 144(c)(1),
or if Cal Dive is not then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, that it has made publicly available the information concerning Cal Dive
required by Rule 144(c)(2).
