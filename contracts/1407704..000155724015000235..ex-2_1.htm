" and together the " _Shareholders_ "). Each of the parties to this Agreement

_Annex A_ opposite such Convertible Note Holder\'s name. _Closing_. The

documents and signatures on the date hereof or upon other satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the

Parties may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Each of the Shareholders hereby severally (and not jointly) represents and
warrants to Cala Energy with respect to itself, as follows.

good title to its LFC Securities, all of which are deemed duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable in all respects, with the
right and authority to sell and deliver marketable title to such LFC
Securities. Upon delivery of any certificate or certificates duly assigned,

beneficial owner of the Convertible Notes listed opposite their respective
name and have not converted or assigned said Convertible Note in whole or in
part.

  

2.2. _Organization_. The Shareholders, if an entity, is an entity is duly
organized and validly existing in its jurisdiction of organization.

  

 _Power and Authority_. The Shareholder has the legal power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
All acts required to be taken by the Shareholder to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out the Transactions have been properly taken. This Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder,
enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

 _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder and the performance by the Shareholder of its obligations
hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof: (a) will not require the
consent of any third party or Governmental Entity under any Laws; (b) will not
violate any Laws applicable to the Shareholder; and (c) will not violate or
breach any contractual obligation to which the Shareholder is a party.

  

    


 

  

 _Litigation_. There is no pending proceeding against the Shareholder, that
involves the LFC Securities or that challenges, or may have the effect of
preventing, delaying or making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of
the Transactions and, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, no such proceeding
has been threatened, and no event or circumstance exists that is reasonably
likely to give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such
proceeding.

  

 _No Finder\'s Fee_. The Shareholder has not created any obligation for any
finder\'s, investment banker\'s or broker\'s fee in connection with the
Transactions that are not payable entirely by the Shareholder.

  

 _Purchase Entirely for Own Account_. The Shareholder is acquiring the Shares
proposed to be acquired hereunder for investment for its own account and not
with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and the
Shareholder has no present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the
Shares, except in compliance with applicable securities laws.

  

 _Available Information_. The Shareholder has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of investment in Cala Energy and has had full access to all the
information it considers necessary or appropriate to make an informed

 _Non-Registration_. The Shareholder understands that the Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act and, if issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, will be issued by reason of a specific exemption

benefits and entitlements attached to the Shares in accordance with Cala
Energy charter documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.

  

 _Restricted Securities_. The Shareholder understands that the Shares are
characterized as "restricted securities" under the Securities Act inasmuch as
this Agreement contemplates that, if acquired by the Shareholder pursuant
hereto, the Shares would be acquired in a transaction not involving a public
offering. The issuance of the Shares hereunder is being effected in reliance
upon an exemption from registration afforded under Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.
The Shareholder further acknowledges that if the Shares are issued to the
Shareholder in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, such Shares
may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or the
existence of an exemption therefrom. The Shareholder represents that it is
familiar with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, as presently in

Securities Act.

assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such

will be enforceable against LFC in accordance with its terms.

  

 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

  

(a) The execution and delivery by LFC of this Agreement does not, and the

Effect.

  

(b) Except for required filings with the SEC and applicable "Blue Sky" or
state securities commissions, no Consent of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, or permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect to LFC in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions.

  

    


 

  

 _Taxes_. LFC and each of its subsidiaries has timely filed, or has caused to
be timely filed on its behalf, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and
all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except to the extent any
failure to file or any inaccuracies in any filed Tax Returns, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
LFC Material Adverse Effect.

  

 _Litigation_. There is no Action against or affecting LFC (or any of its
subsidiaries, if any) or any of their respective properties which (a)
adversely affects or challenges the legality, validity or enforceability of
any of this Agreement or the Shares or (b) could, if there were an unfavorable
decision, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
result in a LFC Material Adverse Effect.

  

 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. LFC and each of its subsidiaries have
conducted its business and operations in compliance with all applicable Laws,
except for instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a LFC Material
Adverse Effect. This Section 3.8 does not relate to taxes, which are the
subject of Section 3.6.

  

 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is
entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of LFC or any of its subsidiaries.

  

 _Contracts_. There are no Contracts that are material to the business,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations
or prospects of LFC. LFC is not in violation of or in default under (nor does
there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which
it is a party or to which it or any of its properties or assets is subject,
except for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a LFC Material Adverse Effect.

  

 _Title to Properties_. LFC and each of its subsidiaries has sufficient title
to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of its properties and assets used in
the conduct of its businesses except for Liens that, in the aggregate, do not
and will not materially interfere with the ability of LFC and its subsidiaries
to conduct business as currently conducted.

  

 _Financial Statements; Liabilities_. LFC has delivered to Cala Energy its
audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2014 (collectively, the " _LFC Financial Statements_ "). The LFC Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated. The
LFC Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition and operating results of LFC, as of the dates, and for the periods,
indicated therein. LFC does not have any material liabilities or obligations,
contingent or otherwise, other than (a) liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business subsequent to February 28, 2015, and (b) obligations under
contracts and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of business

  

    

and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be
reflected in the LFC Financial Statements, which, in both cases, individually
and in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to result in a LFC
Material Adverse Effect.

  

 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. (a) Except as disclosed in the LFC
Financial Statements, from December 31, 2014 to the date of this Agreement,
LFC has conducted its business only in the ordinary course.

  

 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
LFC for inclusion in the current report on Form 8-K (the " _Super 8-K_ ") of
Cala Energy that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

Subject to the exceptions set forth herein or in its reports as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), Cala Energy represents and
warrants as follows to LFC and its Shareholders, with the understanding that

beneficiaries hereof.

licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own,
lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Cala Energy, a material adverse effect on the
ability of Cala Energy to perform its obligations under this Agreement or on
the ability of Cala Energy to consummate the Transactions (an " _Cala Energy
Material Adverse Effect_ "). Cala Energy is duly qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary and where the failure to

Effect.

indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest in any person.

the capital stock of Cala Energy are, and all such shares that may be issued
prior to the date hereof will be when issued, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the Nevada

applicable Laws, including those relating to occupational health and safety,

instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not

exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is

reasonably be expected to result in an Cala Energy Material Adverse Effect.

interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct of its
businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and properties
in which Cala Energy has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens,

interfere with the ability of Cala Energy to conduct business as currently
conducted. Cala Energy has complied in all material respects with the terms of

and all such leases are in full force and effect. Cala Energy enjoys peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.

  

 _Intellectual Property_. Cala Energy does not own, nor is validly licensed

 _Amendments; Waivers; No Additional Consideration_. No provision of this
Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by
LFC, Cala Energy and Shareholders holding a majority in interest of the LFC
Securities measured based upon the number of Shares they are expected to
receive at the Closing. No waiver of any default with respect to any
provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a
waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any
delay or omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner
impair the exercise of any such right. No consideration shall be offered or
paid to any Shareholders to amend or consent to a waiver or

  

    

modification of any provision of any Transaction Document unless the same
consideration is also offered to all Shareholders s then holding the Shares.

  

 _Replacement of Securities_. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any
Shares, Notes or Convertible Notes, is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed,
Cala Energy shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for
and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new
certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Cala Energy of such loss, theft or destruction and customary
and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate
or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-
party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement Shares. If a
replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any Shares is requested due
to a mutilation thereof, Cala Energy may require delivery of such mutilated
certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance of a
replacement.

  

 _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided
herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the
Shareholders, Cala Energy and Shareholders will be entitled to specific
performance under this Agreement. The Parties agree that monetary damages may
not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of
obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in
any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

  

 _Independent Nature of Shareholders\' Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Shareholder under this Agreement are several and not joint
with the obligations of any other Shareholders, and no Shareholder shall be
responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Shareholder under this Agreement or for the accuracy of any representation or
warranty of any other Shareholder under this Agreement. The decision of each
Shareholder to acquire the Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been made by
such Shareholder independently of any other Shareholder after due inquiry.
Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any Shareholder pursuant
hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Shareholders as a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a
presumption that the Shareholders are in any way acting in concert or as a
group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated
herein. Each Shareholder acknowledges that no other Shareholder has acted as
agent for such Shareholder in connection with making its investment hereunder
and that no Shareholder will be acting as agent of such Shareholder in
connection with monitoring its investment in the Shares or enforcing its
rights under this Agreement. Each Shareholder shall be entitled to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation the
rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any
other Shareholder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for
such purpose. Each of LFC and Cala Energy acknowledges that each of the
Shareholders has been provided with this same Agreement for the purpose of
closing a transaction with multiple Shareholders and not because it was
required or requested to do so by any Shareholder.

  

 _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of Cala Energy and LFC acknowledges and agrees that the liability of a
Shareholders arising directly or indirectly, under any Transaction Document of
any and every nature whatsoever shall be satisfied solely out of the assets of
such Shareholders, and that no trustee, officer, other investment vehicle or
any other affiliate of such Shareholder or any investor, shareholder or

  

    

holder of shares of beneficial interest of such Shareholder shall be
personally liable for any liabilities of such Shareholder.

  

 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section,
such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation".

  

 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
