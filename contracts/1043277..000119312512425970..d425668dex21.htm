Indemnified Party, but only if the Indemnifying Party waives the application of the Purchaser Cap or the Seller Cap, as applicable, as it relates to such Third-Party Claim; provided that such later assumption of the defense would not materially
impair the rights of the Indemnified Party or the pending defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, with the fees and disbursements of such counsel being paid by the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such matter (except as set forth below in this Section&nbsp;11.3). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have the sole discretion to control the defense of a matter as it relates to Purchaser (i)&nbsp;in the event of a criminal matter involving Purchaser or an equitable claim against Purchaser, (ii)&nbsp;if the Third-Party
Claim is made by a supplier, customer or employee of Seller, or (iii)&nbsp;if the Third-Party Claim includes material claims for which the Purchaser provides Sellers with written notice that it is not entitled to and will not claim indemnification
to the extent that it is not practical to separately defend such claims. Purchaser shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in a commercially reasonable manner and in the same manner as if it were not entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the
event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim on the terms provided above within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
then any Losses subject to indemnification under this Agreement shall include the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party to the extent incurred before any later assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party in

participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Party&#146;s own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
