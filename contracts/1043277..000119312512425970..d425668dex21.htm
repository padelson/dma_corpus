such consent or approval has not been given as of the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date or,
if shorter, during the remaining term of each Non-Assignable Contract, use
its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, and Seller shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts at Purchasers request to cooperate with Purchaser to: (a)
obtain the consent of the third parties required thereunder to assign such
Non-Assignable Contract to Purchaser; (b) to the extent permitted by Law, make
the benefit of such Non-Assignable Contract available to Purchaser so long as
Purchaser cooperates with Seller and promptly reimburses Seller for all
payments made by Seller (with the prior approval of Purchaser) in connection
therewith; and (c) enforce, at the request of Purchaser, and at the sole
expense and for the account of Purchaser, any right of Seller arising under
such Non-Assignable Contract against the other party or parties thereto
(including the right to terminate any such Non-Assignable Contract in
accordance with the terms thereof). Seller shall have no liability
or obligation to Purchaser if Seller is unable to obtain any consent or
approval. Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge fully the liabilities and
obligations of Seller under any such Non-Assignable Contract from and after
the Closing with respect to the period that Purchaser receives the benefit of
such Non-Assignable Contract. Except as set forth in _Section 9.10_, Seller
shall not take any action or suffer any omission that limits, restricts or
terminates in any material respect the benefits to Purchaser of such Non-
Assignable Contract unless, in good faith and after consultation with and
prior written notice to Purchaser, Seller is: (i) ordered to do so by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) otherwise required to
do so by Law; provided, however, that if any such order is appealable, Seller
shall take such reasonable actions as are requested by Purchaser at the sole
expense of Seller to file and pursue such appeal and to obtain a stay of such
order. With respect to any such Non-Assignable Contract as to which the
necessary approval or consent for the assignment or transfer to Purchaser is
obtained following the Closing, Seller shall transfer such Non-Assignable
Contract to Purchaser by execution and delivery of an instrument of
conveyance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such approval or consent, and Purchaser shall assume and
agree to pay, perform and discharge when due the liabilities and obligations
under such Non-Assignable Contract in the same manner and to the same extent
as described in Section 2.4(b)(i) (and such Non-Assignable Contract will then
be considered an Assumed Contract for all purposes of this Agreement after
such date).

ARTICLE III

 

PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENTS; ALLOCATIONS

Section 3.1. _Purchase Price._ Subject to adjustment pursuant to this Article
III, the aggregate amount to be paid for the Assets (the "Purchase Price")
shall be Three Hundred Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($302,500,000.00). In addition to the foregoing payment, as consideration for
the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Assets, Purchaser shall
assume, pay and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities.

 



17 Section 3.2. _Payment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller an
amount equal to (i) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section
3.2(b)), minus (ii) $62,500, plus (iii) fifty percent (50%) of the Shared
Transaction Expenses.

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall have delivered to Purchaser its good faith estimate of the Net Working
Capital as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date, together with
its calculation of the Working Capital Excess or Working Capital Deficit, if
any (the "Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement"). Purchaser shall have
promptly provided any comments it has to Sellers on such Preliminary Net
Working Capital Statement following receipt from Sellers, which comments shall
have adjusted the draft Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement, and the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of any Working Capital Excess
estimated in the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement or decreased by the
amount of any Working Capital Deficit estimated in the Preliminary Net Working
Capital Statement.

 

(c) All payments required under this Section 3.2 or any other provision
hereof, including Section 3.3(d), shall be made in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank account as shall be designated in
writing by the Person to which the applicable payment is due.

Section 3.3. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Seller the Purchasers calculation, set forth in
reasonable detail, of the actual Net Working Capital and any Working Capital
Deficit or Working Capital Excess, if any (the "Purchaser Working Capital
Statement").

(b) Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Purchaser
Working Capital Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(a) during which to
notify Purchaser of any dispute of any item contained therein, which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and Sellers
calculation of Net Working Capital and any Working Capital Deficit or Working
Capital Excess, if any. During such 30-day period, Purchaser shall grant
Seller and its accountants, at Sellers expense, reasonable access to
all books, records, facilities, work papers, schedules and calculations used
in the Purchasers preparation of the Purchaser Working Capital Statement;
provided, that, Seller and its accountants (if Sellers accountants will be
provided such access) will execute customary access letters in favor of
Purchasers accountants if access to any work papers or reports of Purchasers
accounts is requested. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such resolution,
the Final Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
written agreement of Purchaser and Sellers. In the event Sellers do not notify
Purchaser of any such dispute within such thirty (30)-day period or notifies
Purchaser in writing within such period that it does not dispute any item
contained therein, the Purchaser Working Capital Statement delivered pursuant
to Section 3.3(a) and Purchasers calculation of the Working Capital Deficit
or Working Capital Excess, if any, shall be final and binding upon the Parties
and shall become the final Net Working Capital Statement (the "Final Net
Working Capital Statement") upon the expiration of such thirty (30)-day
period (or upon the receipt of Sellers earlier written notice if there is no
dispute).

 



18 (c) In the event Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any dispute
regarding the Purchaser Working Capital Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 3.3(a) within fifteen (15) days following Purchasers receipt of
notice of such dispute from Seller, the dispute shall be referred to the New
York office of an independent "Big Four" accounting firm to be agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller (the "Independent Firm"), _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Purchaser and Seller cannot agree upon the Independent Firm within
fifteen (15) days following Purchasers receipt of notice of such dispute
from Seller, the Independent Firm shall be Grant Thornton LLP. Each of Seller
and Purchaser agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Firm, an
engagement letter containing reasonable and customary terms. The Independent
Firm shall make its determination with respect to such dispute within thirty
(30) days of its appointment or as soon as is reasonably practicable by
conducting the Independent Firms own review and verification of the
Purchaser Working Capital Statement and Sellers calculations of the Net
Working Capital and any Working Capital Deficit or Working Capital Excess, and
thereafter selecting either the Purchasers calculations of any amounts in
dispute (as set forth in the Purchaser Working Capital Statement delivered by
Purchaser in the 90-day period set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_) or the Sellers
calculations of the Net Working Capital and any Working Capital Deficit or
Working Capital Excess (as set forth in Sellers written notice delivered to
Purchaser during the 30-day period set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_) or an
amount in between the two. In making such determination, the Independent Firm
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Purchaser Working Capital
Statement and Sellers calculations of the Net Working Capital and any Working
Capital Deficit or Working Capital Excess as to which Purchaser and Seller
have disagreed and only to the extent of such disagreement. The Independent
Firm shall act as an arbitrator and its determination of the Final Net Working
Capital Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive as between the
parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
each pay their own costs and expenses incurred under this _Section 3.3_. The
Independent Firms fees and expenses shall be borne by Seller, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Seller and the
Purchaser from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if the difference
between Purchasers calculation of Net Working Capital and Sellers
calculation of Net Working Capital is $500,000 but the Independent Accounting
Firm determines that Net Working Capital is $200,000 more than Purchasers
calculation, then Purchaser shall pay 40% of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Firm and Seller shall pay 60% of such fees and expenses.

 

(d) Upon determination of the final and binding Final Net Working Capital
Statement, within five (5) Business Days, Sellers will pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to any Working Capital Deficit and Purchaser will pay to Seller
an amount equal to any Working Capital Excess.

Section 3.4. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Purchaser agree to
allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code.
Seller and Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall prepare and provide to Seller
a draft allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets within ninety-five
(95) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall notify Purchaser within thirty
(30) days of receipt of such draft allocation of any objection Seller may
have thereto.

 



19  Seller and Purchaser agree to resolve any disagreement with respect to such
allocation in good faith. In addition, Seller and Purchaser hereby undertake
and agree to file timely any information that may be required to be filed
pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1060(b) of the
Code, and shall use the allocation determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 in
connection with the preparation of IRS Form 8594 as such form relates to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Seller nor Purchaser
shall file any Return or other document or otherwise take any position which
is inconsistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this Section 3.4
except as may be adjusted by subsequent agreement following an audit by the
IRS or by court decision.

 

Section 3.5. _Allocation of Taxes_. Any personal property and ad valorem
property Taxes shall be apportioned at the Closing based upon the amounts set
forth in the current tax bills therefor and the number of days in the taxable
period prior to (and including) the Closing Date and in the taxable period
following the Closing Date.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND SHAREHOLDER

Seller and Shareholder jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1. _Organization_.

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (as listed in
_Schedule 4.1(a)_ ) and has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(a)_, Seller is duly
qualified or registered as a foreign corporation to transact business under
the Laws of each jurisdiction where the character of its activities or the
location of the properties owned or leased by it requires such qualification
or registration, except where the failure to be so qualified or registered
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has heretofore made
available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of its articles of
incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect and its corporate record books
with respect to actions taken by its shareholder and board of directors.
_Schedule 4.1(a)_ contains a true, correct and complete list of the
jurisdictions in which Seller is qualified or registered to do business as a
foreign corporation.

(b) Seller does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other
equity, securities or ownership interests in any Person.

 

(c) Shareholder owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of Seller. There are no outstanding options, warrants, conversion rights,
subscriptions or other rights entitling any Person to acquire or receive, or
requiring Seller to issue, any shares of its capital stock or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, such shares of capital stock. There
are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, stock
plans or similar rights with respect to Seller.

 



20 Section 4.2. _Authorization_. Seller has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary
Documents and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Documents by Seller and
the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions provided for herein and therein have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Seller. This Agreement and each of the Seller Ancillary Documents have been
duly executed and delivered by Seller and do or shall, as the case may be,
constitute the valid and binding agreements of Seller, enforceable against
Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding at law or in equity).

Section 4.3.  _Absence of Restrictions and Conflicts_. The execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary
Documents, as applicable, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and the fulfillment of and compliance with the terms and
conditions hereof and thereof do not or shall not (as the case may be), with
the passing of time or the giving of notice or both, (a) contravene or
conflict with any term or provision of the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of Seller, (b) except as indicated on _Schedule 4.3_ , violate or
conflict with, constitute a breach of or default under, result in the loss of
any benefit under, permit the acceleration of any obligation under or create
in any party the right to modify any Assumed Contract required to be listed on
_Schedule 4.13_ , in a manner that would be material to Seller or the
Business, or create in any party the right to terminate or cancel any
Assumed Contract required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ , (c) contravene or
conflict with any judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity to
which Seller is a party or by which Seller or any of the Assets are bound, (d)
contravene or conflict with in any material respect any Law or arbitration
award applicable to Seller or the Business, or (e) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any Asset.

 

Section 4.4. _Required Consents_. _Schedule 4.4_ sets forth each consent,
approval, notification, waiver, authorization or filing (each, a "Required
Consent" and collectively, the "Required Consents") under any applicable Law,
License or Assumed Contract required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ to which
Seller is a party or listed on _Schedule 2.2(c)_ to which Shareholder is a
party, in each case that is necessary with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents to avoid a
breach or violation of, or giving rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or to a loss of any
benefit under any such Law, License or Assumed Contract, in each case that
would be material to Seller or the Business. Except as set forth on 
_Schedule 4.4_ and except for such consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings which, if not obtained,
would not have a Material Adverse Effect, no consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required with respect to Seller in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary
Documents.

 

Section 4.5. _Real Property_. _Schedule 4.5_ sets forth a list of all Real
Property Leases and the street addresses of each Leased Real Property. The
Real Property Leases are in full force and effect and are valid, binding and
enforceable against Seller and, to the Knowledge of the

 



21  Seller, the parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Seller does not
own any real property.

 

Section 4.6. _Personal Property_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6(a)_ ,
all equipment and other items of tangible personal property and assets
included in the Assets are free of material defects, in good operating
condition and in a state of good maintenance and repair, in each case ordinary
wear and tear excepted. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 4.6(a)_, all of
the Assets are in the possession of Seller. _Schedule 4.6(a)_ sets forth the
location of any tangible personal property included in the Assets that is not
located at the Leased Real Property, except for card readers located at
merchant locations and laptops, computer hardware and other related personal
property with employees of the Seller. No Person other than Seller owns any
equipment or other tangible personal property or asset that is necessary
to the operation of the Business as currently conducted, except for the
leased equipment, property or Assets listed on _Schedule 4.6(b)_. Since the
date of the Reference Balance Sheet, Seller has not sold, transferred or
disposed of any Assets, other than sales of inventory in the Ordinary Course
of Business.

Section 4.7. _Sufficiency of and Title to Assets_. Except for the Excluded
Assets, any Intellectual Property and the assets set forth on _Schedule
4.7(a)_ , the Assets and the Shareholder Assets constitute all of the assets
(whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible)
necessary and sufficient to permit Seller to conduct the operations of the
Business in accordance with Sellers past practices. Except for the assets set
forth on _Schedule 4.7(b)_ , Seller has (and shall convey to Purchaser at the
Closing) good and valid title to or, in the case of leased personal property,
valid leasehold interests in the Assets, or, in the case of any Seller
Intellectual Property that is licensed to Seller and the Seller Licensed
Intellectual Property, valid licenses to the Assets, free and clear of all
Liens except Permitted Liens.

Section 4.8. _Financial Statements_.

(a) _Schedule 4.8_ contains true and correct copies of the Financial
Statements. The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP and have been prepared from, and are consistent with, the books and
records of Seller in all material respects, which books and records have been
maintained on a basis consistent with the past practice of Seller in all
material respects; provided, however, that the Financial Statements lack
footnotes and other presentation items and each of the Financial Statements
that is not a year-end Financial Statement is subject to normal year-
end adjustments. Each balance sheet included in the Financial Statements
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the financial position of the Business as of the date of such balance
sheet, and each statement of income and cash flows included in the Financial
Statements (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations and changes in cash flows, as the
case may be, of the Business for the periods set forth therein. Since the
date of the Reference Balance Sheet, there has been no change in any
accounting (or tax accounting) policy, practice or procedure of Seller.

 



22 (b) Seller maintains books and records that fairly reflect, in all material
respects, its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and maintains
proper and adequate internal accounting controls that are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with any necessary managements authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, (iii) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded
accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the
collection thereof on a current and timely basis, and (iv) revenues and
expenses are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the payment thereof on a current and timely basis.

Section 4.9. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no debts, liabilities or
obligations of Seller required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for:

(a) liabilities and obligations fully reflected, reserved for or provided for
in the Reference Balance Sheet;

(b) liabilities and obligations incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business,
since the date of the Reference Balance Sheet;

(c) liabilities and obligations arising after Closing under Contracts which
are not attributable to any failure by Seller to comply with the terms thereof
or failure to comply with any express or implied warranty; and

(d) liabilities and obligations under this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary
Documents.

Section 4.10. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule 4.10_, since the date of the Reference
Balance Sheet until the date of this Agreement, there has not been any:

(a) Material Adverse Effect;

 

(b) damage, destruction, loss or casualty to property or assets of Seller
(including the Assets) with an individual value in excess of $50,000;

(c) transaction with a third party outside of the Ordinary Course of Business
where a payment obligation has been made by Seller in excess of $50,000;

(d) sale, assignment, exclusive license or transfer of a material portion of
the tangible Assets, taken as a whole, except in the Ordinary Course of
Business;

(e) Contract entered into that would be required to be included in _Schedule
4.23_ ;

(f) material increase in the salary or wages of any employees or
contractors of Seller, or introduction or material modification of any
employee or contractor incentive or bonus plan; or

(g) agreement to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



23 Section 4.11. _Legal Proceedings_. Except as listed on _Schedule 4.11_ ,
there is no suit, action, claim, arbitration, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller,
Shareholder, or the Assets before any Governmental Entity that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Assets. No
suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge
of Seller, threatened against Seller, Shareholder, or the Assets before any
Governmental Entity, if finally determined adversely, is reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Assets. Except as listed on _Schedule 4.11_ or in connection with proceedings
in the Ordinary Course of Business for the application and prosecution of
Intellectual Property with any Governmental Entity, neither Seller nor
Shareholder is (a) a named party in any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any court or arbitration panel related to the Assets that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Assets or (b)
to the Knowledge of Seller, subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any court or arbitration panel related to the Assets that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Assets.

Section 4.12. _Compliance with Law_. Except as listed on _Schedule 4.12_ ,
Seller is and since January 1, 2010 has been in compliance with all applicable
Laws in all material respects. Seller has not received any written notice that
it is under investigation with respect to, and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, is not otherwise now under investigation with respect to, a material
violation of any applicable Law; (b) Seller is not a party to, or bound by,
any order, judgment, decree, injunction, rule or award of any Governmental
Entity (other than in connection with proceedings in the Ordinary Course of
Business for the application and prosecution of Intellectual Property); and
(c) Seller has filed all material reports and has all material Licenses
required to be filed with any Governmental Entity on or prior to the date
hereof.

Section 4.13. _Contracts_. Each correspondingly lettered section of 
_Schedule 4.13_ sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the following
Contracts to which Seller is a party that is either currently in force, or
under which Seller has continuing liabilities and/or obligations, related to
the Business (other than any Seller Benefit Plans and the insurance policies
on _Schedule 4.19_ ):

(a) Contracts, other than this Agreement, that (i) limit or restrict Seller
or any employees, agents or representatives of Seller (in their capacity as
such) from engaging in any business or other activity in any jurisdiction; or
(ii) create or purport to create any exclusive relationship or arrangement or
contain a "most favored nations" provision;

(b) Contracts that provide for any payment or benefit as a result of the
execution hereof or the Closing or as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including accelerated vesting or other
similar rights;

 

(c) Contracts granting to any Person an option or a right of first refusal,
first-offer or similar preferential right to purchase or acquire any assets
of Seller;

(d) Contracts (i) with respect to Seller Intellectual Property licensed or
transferred to any third party (other than Contracts with customers entered
into in the Ordinary Course of Business on Sellers standard form document),
or (ii) pursuant to which a third party

 



24  has licensed or transferred any Intellectual Property to Seller (other than
commercially available off-the-shelf software purchased or licensed for less
than $25,000 per item, non-exclusive licenses to Intellectual Property
relating to credit card providers or transaction processing which licenses are
included in Contracts otherwise required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ and
non-negotiated licenses to Intellectual Property embedded in equipment or
fixtures);

(e) joint venture or partnership Contracts or Contracts entitling any Person
to any profits, revenues or cash flows of Seller or the Business or requiring
payments or other distributions based on such profits, revenues or cash flows;

(f) Contracts with those Customers that represent the top 50% of the revenue
of all Customers of the Seller for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and
with those Customers that represent the top 50% of the revenue of all
Customers of the Seller for the six (6) month period ended June 30, 2012 (the
identity of such Customers being determined based on the total dollar amount
of revenues attributable to such Customers for each such period) (the
"Material Customer Contracts");

(g) Contracts with any Governmental Entity;

 

(h) Contracts with those merchants of Seller that represent the one hundred
(100) largest merchants of Seller for the period beginning on January 1, 2011
to December 31, 2011, and for the period beginning on January 1, 2012 to the
six (6) month period ended June 30, 2012 (the identity of such merchants being
determined based on the total dollar amount of revenues attributable to such
merchants) (the "Material Merchant Contracts"); and

(i) Contracts (other than those described in subsections (a) through (h) of
this Section 4.13 and other than Contracts with Customers or merchants of the
Seller) to which Seller is a party or by which its properties or assets are
bound involving an annual commitment or annual payment to or from Seller of
more than $50,000 individually or the loss of which would be reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

With respect to each oral Contract required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ ,
_Schedule 4.13_ sets forth a summary of the material terms of such Contract.

 

Section 4.14. _Assumed Contracts_. True, correct and complete copies of all
Contracts required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ or listed on _Schedule
2.2(c)_ that are Assumed Contracts ("Material Contracts") have been provided
to Purchaser, except for any oral Contracts with merchants, of which the
material terms are described on _Schedule 4.13_. The Assumed Contracts are
legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms with respect to Seller and Shareholder (to the extent each is a party
thereto), and to the Knowledge of Seller, each other party thereto, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding at law or in equity). There is no existing material default or
material breach of Seller or Shareholder under any Assumed Contract (or event
or condition that, with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
material default or material breach) and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there
is no such material default (or event or condition that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute

 



25  a material default or material breach) with respect to any third party to
any Assumed Contract. Except for any oral Assumed Contract the material terms
of which are described on _Schedule 4.13_ , there is no term, obligation,
understanding or agreement that would modify any term of an Assumed Contract
or any right or obligation of a party thereunder which is not reflected on the
face of such Assumed Contract. Seller is and the Business has been conducted
by Sellers in material compliance with all applicable rules, procedures,
policies, and regulations of Comerica Bank, MasterCard International
Incorporated, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (in
each case to the extent required of Sellers by Contract, Comerica Bank or
MasterCard International Incorporated), including without limitation all such
rules and regulations contained in the MasterCard Member Service Provider
Rules Manual.

 

Section 4.15. _Tax Returns; Taxes_. Except as provided in _Schedule 4.15_ :

 

(a) Seller, or Shareholder on behalf of Seller, has timely filed all material
Tax Returns required to be filed on or before the date hereof. All Tax
Returns filed by, on behalf of, or with respect to Seller are complete and
correct in all material respects as related to the Business.

(b) All material Taxes for which Seller has or could have any liability
related to the Business (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
timely paid in full or are accrued as liabilities for Taxes on the books of
Seller. None of the Tax Returns filed by the Seller contain or were required
to contain a disclosure statement under former Section 6661 of the Code or
current Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law). The Sellers have not, with respect to Seller, entered into
any "reportable transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

 

(c) The amounts so paid, together with all amounts accrued as liabilities for
Taxes (including Taxes accrued as currently payable but excluding any accrual
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the books of
Seller, are adequate based on the tax rates and applicable Laws in effect to
satisfy all liabilities for Taxes of Seller in any jurisdiction through
the Closing Date, including Taxes accruable upon income earned through the
Closing Date. No deficiencies related to the Business for Taxes of Seller have
been claimed, proposed or assessed by any Governmental Entity for which the
Seller would reasonably be expected to have any liability. There are no
pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened audits, suits, proceedings,
actions, investigations or claims for or relating to any liability of Seller
related to the Business in respect of Taxes. No power of attorney has been
executed by Seller and is currently in force with respect to any Tax matter
related to the Business.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.15(d)_ , there are no current
extensions of time in effect with respect to the dates on which any Tax
Returns were or are due to be filed by or with respect to Seller related to
the Business. Neither Shareholder nor Seller has waived any statute of
limitation with respect to any Tax with respect to Seller or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency with respect
to the Business.

(e) All Tax deficiencies asserted as a result of any examination by a
Governmental Entity of a Tax Return of Seller of or with respect to the
Business have been timely paid in full, accrued on the books of Seller or
finally settled.

, Seller has heretofore delivered or made available to Purchaser true,
correct and complete copies of the plan documents and any amendments thereto
(or, in the event the plan is not written, a written description thereof), any

plan descriptions required under all applicable Laws, the most recent
determination or opinion letter received from the Internal Revenue Service

in compliance with all Applicable Benefit Laws. Seller has performed and
complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under or with
respect to Seller Benefit Plans. Seller has not incurred, and no fact exists
that reasonably would be expected to result in, any liability to Seller with
respect to any Seller Benefit Plan, including any liability, tax, penalty or

such plan.

contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due with
respect to each Seller Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods
prescribed by ERISA and the Code, and all contributions and premium payments

liabilities (contingent or otherwise) with respect thereto other than (A)
continuation coverage required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Part
6 of Title I of ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, and any other
Applicable Benefit Laws, or (B) benefits the full cost of which is borne by
the current or former employee (or the employees beneficiary).

 

(h) _Schedule 4.17(h)_ identifies each Seller Benefit Plan covering the
current employees of the Business that is a "nonqualified deferred

in all material respects in compliance with Code Section 409A since January 1,
2005, or if later, the date the NQDC Plan was first subject to Section 409A of
the Code, or (B) does not provide for the payment of any benefits that have
or will be deferred or vested after December 31, 2004 and since October 3,
2004, it has not been "materially modified" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code and associated Treasury Department guidance.

Section 4.18. _Labor Relations_.

 

(a) Seller is not a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement
or other agreement or obligation of any sort with any labor union, and no
collective bargaining agreement is currently being negotiated. There are no
strikes or other work stoppages involving any employees of Seller and there
are no labor disputes by any labor organization in progress or pending or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller. Seller has not
encountered any labor union organizing activity, nor had any actual, or to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or
lockouts. Seller is in compliance in all material respects with Labor Laws
and related regulations. Seller is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, any

employment matters involving any employee of Seller pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened against Seller before any Governmental Entity
that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Assets.

past practices; provided that the Sellers sole and exclusive representations
and warranties with respect to infringement, misappropriation or conflict with
any rights of any Person in respect of Intellectual Property are set forth in

conditions of any exclusive licenses to Seller or Shareholder and Permitted
Liens) and (ii) requirement of any past, present or future royalty payments,
license fees, charges or other payments, except as set forth in _Schedule
4.21(g)_. Immediately after the Closing and except with respect to Non-

have licensed to it all Seller Intellectual Property free from Liens (subject
to any applicable exclusive licenses and any Permitted Liens surviving after

the Closing.

(h) To the Knowledge of Seller, neither the conduct of the Business as
currently conducted nor the Seller Proprietary Software owned by Seller or
Shareholder infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict with any patent or
trademark rights of any Person in respect of Intellectual Property. Neither

available for use by any Person without a written license from Seller or
Shareholder (as applicable).

 

(i) Since January 1, 2010, no written claim or demand of any Person has been

in respect of Seller Intellectual Property, or (ii) asserts that Seller or
Shareholder is infringing or otherwise in conflict with, or is required to pay
any royalty, license fee, charge or other amount in regard to, any
Intellectual Property. Without limiting the foregoing, no interference,
opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or Shareholder or involves the
Seller Intellectual Property (excluding for this purpose any property of a
third party), in which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any of such
Seller Intellectual Property is being or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,

Shareholder has received any written notice from any third party claiming
any right, title or interest in Seller Proprietary Software owned by Seller
or Shareholder.

(b) _Schedule 4.22(b)_  identifies each component of the Seller Proprietary
Software that is licensed to Seller or Shareholder. The use of Seller Software
in the Business as currently conducted does not materially breach any term of
any license or other contract between Seller or Shareholder and any third
party.

(d) No Open Source Code has been or is being used or distributed, in whole or
in part, in a manner that would require any Seller Proprietary Software
(other than any Open Source Code portions thereof that were obtained from
third parties and any portions thereof which are distributed as source code by
Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business) to be licensed, disclosed or
distributed without charge or under terms that require disclosure of source
code. For purposes of this Agreement, "Open Source Code" means any software
code (including, without limitation, any source code components,
applications, plug-ins or libraries) that is distributed as "open source
software" or is otherwise distributed publicly or made generally available in
source code form under terms that permit modification and redistribution of
such software. Open Source Code includes, without limitation, software code

(h) Seller has in place a privacy policy regarding the collection and use of
customer information in accordance with applicable Law in all material
respects. Seller is in compliance with such privacy policy and all applicable

, no (a) shareholder or officer or director of Seller; (b) officer or director

(a) Except as limited by the HSR Act and related rules and regulations,
_Schedule 4.24(a)_ contains a true, correct and complete list of the
Customers that represent the top 50% of the revenue of all Customers of the
Seller (the identity of such Customers being determined based on the total
dollar amount of revenues attributable to such Customers) for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2011 and with those Customers that represent the top 50%
of the revenue of all Customers of the Seller for the six (6) month period
ended June 30, 2012 (the "Key Customers") and a list of the one hundred (100)
largest merchants of Seller (the identity of such merchants being determined
based on the total dollar amount of revenues attributable to such merchants)
for the period beginning on January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and for the
period beginning on January 1, 2012 to the six (6) month period ended June 30,
2012 (the "Key Merchants"). Except as limited by the HSR Act and related rules
and regulations and except for any oral Contracts with merchants of which the
material terms are required to be described on _Schedule 4.13_ , Seller has
provided to Purchaser complete and accurate copies of the Contracts to which
Seller is a party with any Key Customer or Key Merchant. Except as provided
on _Schedule 4.24(a)_ and except for revenues from the Shareholder, the
revenues reflected in the Financial Statements were derived solely from the
sale of Sellers products and services to non-Affiliate customers of the
Business who purchased or licensed such products and services pursuant to
bona fide arms-length commercial transactions.

 



33 (b) Other than with respect to the non-renewal of Material Customer Contracts
or Material Merchant Contracts in the Ordinary Course of Business, and except
as provided on _Schedule 4.24(b)_ , no Key Customer or Key Merchant during the
prior twelve (12) months has canceled or terminated or, to the Actual
Knowledge of Seller, made any written threat to cancel or otherwise terminate
any of such Key Customers or Key Merchants Contracts with Seller, other than
in connection with the negotiation of Contracts with Key Customers or Key
Merchants or requests for fee reductions by Key Customers or Key Merchants,
in each case which Seller would not reasonably expect to result in the
termination of such Contract. To the Actual Knowledge of Seller, Seller has
not received any written notice from any current Key Customer or Key Merchant
during the prior twelve (12) months that such Key Customer or Key Merchant, as
applicable, intends to terminate its business relations with Seller or reduce
the revenue of Seller attributable to such Key Customer or Key Merchant for
products or services by more than $50,000 per year for any individual Key
Customer or Key Merchant, either as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise other than in connection with the negotiation of Contracts
with Key Customers or Key Merchants or requests for fee reductions by Key
Customers or Key Merchants, in each case which Seller would not reasonably
expect to result in the termination of or a material reduction in revenue from
such business relations. 

Section 4.25. _Receivables_. All Receivables (i) are valid and existing, (ii)
represent monies due for goods sold and delivered or services rendered in the
Ordinary Course of Business and (iii) are not subject to any refund or
adjustment or to Sellers Knowledge, any defense, right of set-off,
assignment, restriction, security interest against the Assets or other Lien
against the Assets. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no disputes regarding the
collectability of any such Receivables.

Section 4.26. _Licenses_. _Schedule 4.26_ is a true, correct and complete list
of all material Licenses held by Seller. Seller owns or possesses all material
Licenses that are necessary to enable it to carry on the Business as
presently conducted. All material Licenses are valid, binding and in full
force and effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.26_, the execution,
delivery and performance hereof and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would not reasonably be expected to terminate or cause a
material restriction on any License. Seller has taken all necessary action to
maintain each material License, except where the failure to so act would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 4.26_
identifies with an asterisk each material License set forth therein which by
its terms cannot be transferred to Purchaser at Closing.

 

Section 4.27. _Ethical Practices with Governmental Entities_. Neither Seller
nor any of its agents with legal authority to bind Seller has offered or

Governmental Entity, any political party or official thereof or any
candidate for political office; (b) any employee of any Governmental Entity
or representative of any Governmental Entity with legal authority to bind such
Governmental Entity; or (c) any other Person, in any such case while knowing
or having reason to know that all or a portion of such money or thing of
value has been offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to any
employee or member of any Governmental Entity or any candidate for political
office for the purpose of, in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), the

obtaining business for Seller, in such Persons official

 



34  capacity, including a decision to fail to perform such Persons official
function regarding obtaining business for Seller; (ii) inducing such Person to
use such Persons influence with any Governmental Entity to affect or
influence any act or decision of such Governmental Entity to assist Seller in
obtaining or retaining business for, with, or directing business to, any
Person; or (iii) where such payment would constitute a bribe, kickback or
illegal or improper payment to assist Seller in obtaining or retaining
business for, with, or directing business to, any Person.

Shareholder, nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees has

to which Seller is a party or otherwise binding upon Seller under which Seller
is (a) prohibited from conducting any line of the Business in any
jurisdiction; (b) restricted from selling, providing or otherwise
distributing any of its products or services to any customer or class of
customers; or (c) required to sell, provide or otherwise distribute its

Warranties_. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Seller, the
Shareholder nor any other Person on behalf of Seller or Shareholder makes any
other representations or warranties or similar assurances (whether direct or
indirect, written or oral, statutory, express or implied) and the Seller and
the Shareholder expressly disclaim any representations or warranties or
similar assurances of any kind or nature, express or implied, as to the
condition, value, suitability, quality or prospects of the Business, the
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Seller furnished or made available to Purchaser and
its representatives. THE SELLER AND THE SHAREHOLDER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE,
SUITABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH
RESPECT TO THE ASSETS, THE BUSINESS, THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR ANY PART
THEREOF, OR AS TO THE WORKMANSHIP THEREOF, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS
THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY MADE BY THE SELLER OR THE
SHAREHOLDER IN ARTICLE IV OR ARTICLE V.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SHAREHOLDER

Shareholder represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

Section 5.1.  _Organization_. Shareholder is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.

 



35 Section 5.2. _Authorization_. Shareholder has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary
Documents, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Documents by Shareholder,
the performance by Shareholder of its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
and the consummation of the transactions provided for herein and therein have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Shareholder. This Agreement and each of the Seller Ancillary Documents
have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and do or
shall, as the case may be, constitute the valid and binding agreements of
Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

Section 5.3. _Absence of Restrictions and Conflicts_. The execution, delivery
and performance by Shareholder of this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the fulfillment of and compliance with the
terms and conditions hereof and thereof do not or shall not (as the case may
be), with the passing of time or the giving of notice or both, (a) violate or
conflict with, constitute a breach of or default under, result in the loss of
any benefit under, permit the acceleration of any obligation under or create
in any party the right to terminate, modify or cancel any Assumed Contract to
which Shareholder is a party; (b) contravene or conflict with any judgment,
decree or order of any Governmental Entity to which Shareholder is a party or
by which Shareholder is bound; or (c) contravene or conflict with in
any material respect any Law or arbitration award applicable to Seller; in
the case of each of (a)-(c) above which individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required with respect to Shareholder in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
Seller Ancillary Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.4. _Legal Proceedings_. There are no suits, actions, claims,
proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder,
threatened against, relating to or involving Shareholder before any
Governmental Entity that adversely affects Shareholders ability

individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5. _Title to Assets_. Except for the Seller Transition Services
Intellectual Property and Software and any rights Shareholder may hold in the
Excluded Assets, the Shareholder Assets comprise all of the assets,
properties and rights of every kind, nature, character and description,

§54.4980B-9, QandA 4). Seller shall take all steps that may be necessary,
including arranging for continued group health plan coverage for the COBRA
statutory coverage period for each MandA qualified beneficiary, to ensure that
such COBRA continuation coverage is available to such individuals and to
ensure

 



38  that the provisions of Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9, QandA 8(c) do not
become applicable at any time, and to prevent Purchaser from becoming by
operation of such regulation section or otherwise, a "successor employer" for
purposes of COBRA Coverage. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for offering
and providing any COBRA Coverage required with respect to any Transferred
Employee (or other qualified beneficiary) who becomes covered by a group
health plan sponsored or contributed to by Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser ("Purchaser Group Health Plan") and who experiences a qualifying
event following the Closing Date while covered under a Purchaser Group Health
Plan. For purposes hereof, each "qualified beneficiary", "MandA qualified
beneficiaries", "group health plan" and "qualifying event" shall have the
meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4980B of the Code and the related
regulations.

(b) _Information_. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, Seller
shall provide Purchaser all information relating to each employee of Seller as
Purchaser may reasonably require in connection with its employment or
engagement of such individuals, including initial employment dates,
termination dates, reemployment dates, hours of service, compensation and tax
withholding history in a form that shall be usable by Purchaser.

 

(c) _Seller Benefit Plans_. Seller or Shareholder shall be solely responsible
for all liabilities based upon, arising out of or relating to Employee
Benefit Plans of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate or the employment or
termination of Sellers current or former employees before such employee
becomes a Transferred Employee, whether asserted prior to, on or after such
date. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all liabilities based upon,
arising out of or relating to the Employee Benefit Plans of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, as applicable, or the employment of the Transferred Employees by
Purchaser or its Affiliates, as applicable, after such Transferred Employee
first becomes a Transferred Employee.

(d) _FMLA Information_.  _Schedule 9.1(d)_ contains a true, correct and
complete list of (i) each employee who is eligible to request FMLA leave as of
the Closing Date and the amount of FMLA leave utilized by each such employee
during the current leave year; and (ii) each employee who has requested to be
on FMLA leave at the Closing Date or to begin FMLA leave after the Closing
Date, and for such employee his or her job title and description and current
salary and benefits.

 

(e) _Service Credit_. Purchaser shall, with respect to the Transferred
Employees, (i) waive any limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements under any welfare benefit plan in which such Transferred
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no such waiver shall apply to a preexisting condition of
any Transferred Employee who was, prior to the Closing Date, excluded from
participation in a welfare benefit plan maintained or contributed to for the
benefit of such Transferred Employee by the nature of such preexisting
condition; and (ii) recognize all service of the Transferred Employees with
Seller to the extent Seller recognized such service, for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting credit, and for purposes of
determining severance or vacation benefits (subject to the maximum severance
and vacation benefits applicable to such Transferred Employees under such
benefit policies).

 



39 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.1, nothing herein shall be
deemed to (i) require Purchaser to hire any employees of Seller or retain any
Transferred Employee for any specific period of time after the Closing Date or
(ii) create an employment contract with any Transferred Employee.

 

(g) For all employees employed by Seller as of the date immediately prior to
the Closing, Seller shall continue to employ such employees in accordance
with the Transition Services Agreement.

(h) Subject to this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, Seller
shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating to or
arising out of the employment, engagement, remuneration, or cessation of
employment with Seller of any employee of Seller with respect to all periods
prior to and including each such employees last day of employment with
Seller. Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall pay each
employee of Seller (including any Transferred Employee hired by Purchaser on
or after the Closing Date) all accrued wages, salary, commission, bonus, and
other employee compensation and employee benefits related to employment with
Seller for all periods through the date of termination of each such employees
employment with Seller in a timely fashion and not later than the date such
payment is required by Law or the provisions of any Employee Benefit Plan or
Contract to which Seller is a party under which such compensation or benefit
is or becomes duly payable.

deductions) upon termination of their employment with Seller.

(j) Purchaser shall offer employment to a sufficient number of employees of
Seller and on such sufficient terms that no plant closing, mass layoff, or
reduction in force requiring notice pursuant to the WARN Act or any similar
applicable state or local Law with respect to such employees occurs on or
after the Closing Date in connection with the consummation of the
transactions. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate, both before and after
the Closing, to identify any potential plant closing, mass layoff, or
reduction in force requiring notice pursuant to the WARN Act or any similar
applicable state or local Law with respect to the employees of Seller in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(k) Without limiting _Section 12.10_ or the foregoing terms of this 
_Section 9.1_, no Person, including any employee (or dependent thereof) of
the Seller, is a third-party beneficiary of any term of this _Section 9.1_
and this _Section 9.1_ shall not create any rights in any Person, including
any employee (or dependent thereon) of Seller, other than Purchaser.

by Seller. Any registration or similar recording fees payable as a result of
the purchase and sale of the Assets or any other action contemplated hereby
shall be paid by Purchaser. The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all

 



40  returns, questionnaires, applications and other documents regarding Taxes
and all transfer, recording, registration and other fees that become payable
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are required or
permitted to be filed at or prior to the Closing.

Section 9.3. _Source Code_. Computer hardware included in the Assets will
contain all of the source code for the Seller Proprietary Software as it

party will retain any copy of any Software that comprises any portion of any

benefit or for the benefit of another, Confidential Information at any time
following the date hereof without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
except to the extent that (i) Seller or Shareholder is required to disclose or
publish such Confidential Information under applicable Laws or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange (provided Seller

the extent permitted by Law and reasonably practicable under the circumstances
so that Purchaser may seek confidential treatment or a protective order with
respect to such information), (ii) Seller or Shareholder is required to

proceeding, defend or pursue indemnification matters hereunder, or respond
to any investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of any
Governmental Entity, or (iv) such Confidential Information is lawfully
acquired by Seller or Shareholder, any of their Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives after the Closing from sources which are not
prohibited from disclosing such information under any legal or contractual
obligation to Purchaser. In addition, Seller and Shareholder shall not make
use of any Confidential Information that is either a trade secret under
applicable Law or Seller Intellectual Property, whether directly or
indirectly, and whether for such partys own benefit or for the benefit of
another, at any time following the date hereof without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, except to the extent of the exceptions set forth in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

(b)  _Non-Competition_.

shall prevent either of the Sellers from undertaking such activities to the
extent in connection with the purchase by Seller or Shareholder of any
products or services offered by the Business from any Person. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller, the Shareholder and their Affiliates may (X) own,

traded on any recognized domestic or foreign securities exchange or over-the-
counter market if Sellers are not a Controlling Person of, or a member of a
group which Controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 2%
or more of any class of securities of such Person, (Y) acquire and operate
any business or entity that is acquired after Closing (whether through the
purchase of assets, equity interests or otherwise) (such business or entity so
acquired being the "Permitted Acquired Business") if the portion of the
Permitted Acquired Business that is engaged in any business that would be
prohibited under this _Section 9.4(b_) (the "Competitive Business"): (1)
supports only the Permitted Acquired Business (and in such case, Seller,
Shareholder or its Affiliate, as applicable, completely transitions the

total revenue of such Permitted Acquired Business during the most recently
completed fiscal year of such Permitted Acquired Business preceding the date
of such acquisition; _provided however_ , that Seller or Shareholder must
extend to Purchaser a right to purchase (the "Purchase Right") such
Competitive Business in accordance with  _Section 9.4(b)(iii)_ below, and

Agreement and the Money Transfer Services Agreement, Seller, Shareholder or
its Affiliate, as applicable, will completely transition the Permitted
Acquired Business off its internal support from the Competitive Business and
to Purchasers services under the terms of the MasterCard Services Agreement
and Money Transfer Services Agreement (assuming such applicable agreement is
still in effect) within six (6) months of the date the Permitted Acquired
Business is acquired; or (Z) engage in the activities described in _Schedule
9.4(b)_. At no time during the Noncompete Period will the aggregate revenue

year of Shareholder. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

In the event that either Seller or Shareholder acquires a Permitted Acquired
Business after Closing that engages in the Competitive Business in support of
businesses other than the Permitted Acquired Business, such acquiring party
(the "Acquiror") shall, within ninety (90) days of the closing of such
acquisition, deliver to Purchaser a written notice (the
"Permitted Acquisition Notice") that sets forth in reasonable detail the
purchase price (including the multiple of EBITDA upon which the purchase price
was based) and the other material terms and conditions related to the
acquisition of the Permitted Acquired Business, subject to the Acquirors
reasonable confidentiality precautions. Within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by Purchaser of the Permitted Acquisition Notice, the Purchaser may
exercise its Purchase Right by delivering a written notice to the Acquiror
agreeing that it will purchase the Competitive Business on substantially
similar terms and conditions as the Acquiror purchased the Permitted Acquired
Business, including a purchase price based on the same multiple of EBITDA
paid by the Acquiror for the Permitted Acquired Business described in the
Permitted Acquisition Notice (the "Permitted Acquisition Exercise Notice"),
except that the Purchaser shall pay the purchase price for the
Competitive Business in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
regardless of the form of consideration paid by the Acquiror for the Permitted
Acquired Business. Purchaser may only exercise its Purchase Right by
delivering the Permitted Acquisition Exercise Notice to the Acquiror within
such thirty (30) day period and will forfeit its Purchase Right with respect
to such Competitive Business if it fails to deliver a Permitted Acquisition
Exercise  

---|---|--- 
 



43 agree to negotiate in good faith the terms and the definitive transaction
documents of the proposed acquisition for a period of sixty (60) days
following the delivery of the Permitted Acquisition Exercise Notice. If the
transaction contemplated by the Permitted Acquisition Exercise Notice is not
consummated by the end of the sixty (60) day period, Acquiror will not
be obligated to consummate such transaction and the Purchaser shall no longer
have a Purchase Right with respect to such Competitive Business. 
---|--- 

(c) _Customer and Vendor Non-Solicitation_. None of the Sellers shall, during
the Noncompete Period, in any manner, directly, indirectly, individually, in
partnership, jointly or in conjunction with any Person, (i) solicit any

the Closing Date for the purpose of providing, distributing or selling
products or services that compete with the products or services of the
Business or (ii) persuade or attempt to persuade any customer or supplier of
Purchaser to terminate or modify such customers or suppliers relationship
with Purchaser including by persuading or attempting to persuade any
customer or supplier of Purchaser to use alternative payment mechanisms that
would compete with the Business. Nothing in this _Section 9.4(c)_ shall
prevent either Seller from soliciting motor carriers and other transportation
logistic industry participants within the scope of the Shareholders broader
transportation and logistics business operations so long as such solicitation
does not violate _Section 9.4(a)_ or _9.4(b)_.

 

(d) _Employee Non-Solicitation_. None of the Sellers shall, for a period of
five (5) years following the Closing Date, in any manner, directly,
indirectly, individually, in partnership, jointly or in conjunction with any
Person, (i) recruit or solicit or attempt to recruit or solicit, on any of
their behalves or on behalf of any other Person, any employee of Purchaser or
employee of Seller who is offered employment by Purchaser (each a "Restricted
Employee"), for purposes of employment of such employee by either Seller,
Shareholder or any of their Affiliates, (ii) encourage any Person (other than
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates) to recruit or solicit any Restricted
Employee for purposes of employment of such employee by either Seller,
Shareholder or any of their Affiliates, or (iii) otherwise encourage any
Restricted Employee to discontinue his or her employment by Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall not, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing
Date, in any manner, directly, indirectly, individually, in partnership,
jointly or in conjunction with any Person, (i) recruit or solicit or attempt
to recruit or solicit, on its behalf or on behalf of any other Person, any
employee of the Shareholder for purposes of employment of such employee by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii) encourage any Person to recruit or
solicit any employee of the Shareholder for purposes of employment of such
employee by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) otherwise encourage
any employee of the Shareholder to discontinue his or her employment by the

search or employment agency), (ii) Shareholder, Seller or any of their
Affiliates from soliciting or hiring (A) any Restricted Employee whose

employment, or (D) any Restricted Employee who does not accept an offer of
employment with the Purchaser as a result of any required relocation more than
50 miles from Eden Prairie, Minnesota or (iii) Shareholder or Seller from
complying with the Transition Services Agreement. 

(e) _Severability_. In the event a judicial determination is made that any
provision of this Section 9.4 constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable restriction against any Party, the provisions of this Section
9.4 shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial determination
finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable with
respect to any of the Parties. In this regard, any judicial authority
construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever or reduce any portion of
the Territory, any prohibited business activity or any time period from the
coverage of this Section 9.4 to the applicable Party only, and to apply the
provisions of this Section 9.4 to the remaining portion of the Territory, the
remaining business activities and the remaining time period not so severed
or reduced by such judicial authority to the applicable Party. The time
period during which the prohibitions set forth in this Section 9.4 shall apply
shall be tolled and suspended for a period equal to the aggregate time during
which Seller, Shareholder or Purchaser violates such prohibitions.

part of its rights hereunder to one or more Affiliates of Purchaser so long as
such Affiliate assumes the obligations of Purchaser hereunder and Purchaser
remains liable for the obligations of Purchaser hereunder.

Section 9.9. _Certain Bank Accounts_

(a) _Transfer of Accounts_. For a period of ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Date (the "Account Transition Period"), Purchaser shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to, and Seller shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts at Purchasers request to cooperate with Purchaser to,
transfer to Purchaser the bank accounts and lock boxes maintained by Seller
and set forth on Schedule 9.9 (the "Accounts") and to have Seller and
Shareholder released from all liabilities and obligations related to the
Accounts. Seller shall have no liability or obligation to Purchaser if Seller
is unable to obtain any consent or approval to transfer the Accounts. With
respect to any such Account as to which the necessary approval and consent for
the transfer to Purchaser, and release of Seller and Shareholder, is obtained
following the Closing, (i) Seller shall transfer such Account to Purchaser by
execution and delivery of any reasonably requested documents required in order
to effect such transfer (which documents shall not contain any obligation or
liability of Seller or Shareholder other than effecting such transfer) and
(ii) Purchaser shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge when due
the liabilities and obligations under such Account by execution and delivery
of any reasonably requested documents required in order to assume such
Accounts (in the same manner and to the same extent as described in Section
2.4(b)(i)) (and such Account will then be considered an Asset for all purposes
of this Agreement after such date). Any Account that has not been transferred
to Purchaser at any given time is referred to herein as a "Retained Account."

 



47 (b) _Account Maintenance __._

 

(i) _Accounts Generally_. Seller shall maintain the Retained Accounts on
behalf of the Purchaser for not less than the Account Transition Period
(except as set forth in this Section 9.9). After the Account Transition
Period, Seller may close the Retained Accounts.

(ii) _Debits._ During the Account Transition Period (except as set forth in
this Section 9.9), so long as Purchaser is in compliance with its obligations
hereunder and cleared amounts are available therein to cover all such
payments, Seller will permit payments to existing merchants of Seller (as of
immediately before the date hereof) from the Retained Accounts in accordance
with past practices of Seller and as directed by Purchaser. However, Seller
and Shareholder shall have no obligation to replenish any funds paid from the
Accounts (and, in accordance therewith, may cancel any "zero-balance" or
similar function providing for replenishment of the Accounts from
other accounts maintained by Shareholder or Seller). After the Account
Transition Period, Seller may refuse to honor (and instruct the applicable
bank to refuse to honor) any further debits against the Retained Accounts.

 

(iii) _Credits_. During the Account Transition Period (except as set forth in
this Section 9.9), Seller will not take any action to stop the Retained
Accounts from receiving ACH credits from existing customers of Seller (as of
immediately before the date hereof).

(iv) _Maintenance of Minimum Balances._ At all times during the Account
Transition Period, Purchaser shall maintain the balance of each Retained
Account at not less than the minimum balance for such Retained Account set
forth on Schedule 9.9 (each applicable minimum balance, the "Minimum Balance")
in accordance with this Section 9.9. By 11:00 a.m. Central Time on each
Business Day during the Account Transition Period, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a schedule reflecting debit and credit information, including
projected collected and available balance (the "Account Schedule"), regarding
the Retained Accounts. If the projected collected and available balance in
any Retained Account as set forth on the Account Schedule is less than the
applicable Minimum Balance for such Retained Account, then Purchaser shall
immediately deposit in the applicable Retained Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds the amount necessary in order for the
projected collected and available balance in such Retained Account to equal or
exceed the applicable Minimum Balance for such Retained Account. If Purchaser
fails to effect such deposit by 3:00 p.m. Central Time on any Business Day,
then Seller may immediately close all Retained Accounts and refuse to honor
(and instruct the applicable bank to refuse to honor) any further debits
against all Retained Accounts. If the aggregate projected collected and
available balance in all of the Retained Accounts as set forth on the Account
Schedule is greater than the aggregate Minimum Balances for all Retained
Accounts, then Seller will wire the excess amount in each Retained Account
that has a

 



48  projected collected and available balance in excess of the applicable
Minimum Balance for such Retained Account that is over and above the
applicable Minimum Balance out of such Retained Account to an account
designated by Purchaser by 3:00 p.m. Central Time on such Business Day.

(c) _Lock Box_. During the Account Transition Period, Seller will maintain
each lock box set forth on Schedule 9.9. (each, a "Lock Box") on behalf of
Purchaser. Seller will instruct the applicable bank that is administering the
applicable Lock Box (i) while the  _related_ Retained Account remains open,
to deposit all amounts received in such Lock Box into the related Retained
Account in accordance with past practice, and (ii) thereafter, so long as such
Lock Box is maintained, to forward all mail received at the Lock Box to
Purchaser at the address specified in Section 12.2 (but with no obligation to
send required copies). After the Account Transition Period, Seller may close
each Lock Box.

 

(d) _Account Balances at end of Account Transition Period_. Within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of the Account Transition Period, Seller shall
transfer out of any Retained Account the positive balance of cleared amounts
that are then available in such Retained Account to Purchaser by wire transfer
of immediately available funds; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers shall
be entitled to set-off any amounts that either of them may be entitled
pursuant to Section 9.9(e) below against such positive balances.

(e) _Fees and Indemnification __._ Purchaser will pay to Shareholder and
Seller, and indemnify each of them from, against and in respect of, all
Losses, fees, costs and expenses incurred by Shareholder or Seller arising
out of or relating to the Accounts (including the Lock Boxes), including any
negative balances or overdraft amounts existing on or after the end of the
Account Transition Period (and related costs, fees, expenses and penalties)
and any fees, costs, and expenses relating to the operation or maintenance of
the Accounts (including the Lock Boxes) from and after the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated to
reimburse Seller or Shareholder for any internal costs and expenses of Seller
or Shareholder in the nature of employment-related costs or allocations of
overhead costs. Shareholder and Seller shall be entitled to set-off any amount
that either of them may be entitled to pursuant to this Section 9.9(e)
against any amount, right or obligations owed to Purchaser under this
Agreement or any Purchaser Ancillary Documents, including the Transition
Services Agreement, the MasterCard Services Agreement and the Money Transfer
Services Agreement.

(f) _Withdrawal of Funds_. During the Account Transition Period,
neither Shareholder nor Seller shall withdraw funds from any Account for its
own use or for use by any Person except (i) as contemplated by this Section
9.9, (ii) as authorized by any employee of Purchaser or any Leased Employee
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) or (iii) in order to
enforce its set-off rights under Section 9.9(d), 9.9(e) or 11.6 or under the
Transition Services Agreement. Furthermore, except as set forth in Section
9.9(h) below, Shareholder shall not permit any Liens to be placed upon the
Accounts.

(g) _Acts of Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, neither Shareholder nor Seller shall be liable or responsible
for any acts or omissions of any person or entity other than Shareholder or
Seller, including any such acts or omissions that prohibit or impair the
ability of Shareholder or Seller to take any actions under this Section 9.9.

 



49 (h) _Grant of Security Interest_.

 



     | (i) | As security for the full, prompt and complete payment and
performance when due of all of the obligations and amounts owing by Seller
and/or Shareholder to Purchaser pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, Seller does hereby grant to
Purchaser a security interest (subject to set-off rights of Shareholder and
Seller) in all of its right, title and interest (if any) in, (A) all monies,
securities, instruments and other investments deposited in any of the Accounts
to the extent collected and not refundable or returnable; and (B) all products
accession, rents profits and "proceeds" (as such term is defined in the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in Delaware; the "UCC") of the foregoing
(collectively, herein called the "Account Collateral"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | The enforcement of the rights and remedies arising under
the grant of security interest in the Account Collateral contained in
preceding clause (i) shall be governed by the UCC and other applicable law.
No action shall be taken or required to be taken to perfect such security
interest. 
---|---|--- 

Section 9.10. _Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts_. Purchaser shall, for a period of
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to, and Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts at
Purchasers request to cooperate with Purchaser to: (a) obtain the consent of
the third parties required thereunder to assign the Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts
to Purchaser or (b) obtain for Purchaser its own Contracts to replace the
Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts if Purchaser is unable to obtain any such consent
or approval. If (a) Purchaser has not obtained such consent or approval of
third parties to assign such Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts or has not entered
into its own Contracts to replace each of the Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts on or
before December 31, 2012 or (b) any third party to any Schedule 11.2(g)
Contracts terminates such Contract or ceases providing products or services
under such Contract in accordance with past practices, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, including under Section 2.5,
Shareholder and Seller may terminate any such Contract and take all such
actions as are reasonably required as a result of such termination or
cessation.

and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party
arising out of or relating to:

(a) Purchasers failure to perform, discharge or satisfy the Assumed
Liabilities, _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller Indemnified Parties shall
not be indemnified with respect to Losses arising with respect to any Non-
Assignable Contract to the extent such Losses result from (i) Sellers failure
to take any lawful action under such Non-Assignable Contract before the
assignment of such Non-Assignable Contract to Purchaser under Section 2.5 in
accordance with Purchasers reasonable written instructions or (ii) Sellers
gross negligence or willful misconduct as it relates to performance under such
Non-Assignable Contract before the assignment of such Non-Assignable Contract

limiting the generality of the foregoing, the foregoing shall include any and
all such Losses incurred by Shareholder under the Contracts set forth on

Section 2.5 with respect to the Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts, or (iii)

permitting-related products and services to any of its Customers after the
Closing as a result of Purchaser not having in place any Contract or License

such products and services.

 



53 Section 11.3. _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third
party (including any Governmental Entity) of any complaint, dispute, claim,
audit, investigation, action or proceeding ("Third-Party Claim") with respect
to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the
other Party for any Purchaser Losses or any Seller Losses (as the case may
be), such Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice thereof to
Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to
such claim only if, and only to the extent that, (i) such failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of
rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such claim or (ii) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the
failure to promptly receive such notice. The Indemnified Party shall
promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party all information and documentation
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice from the Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim to assume
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, but only if the Indemnifying Party
waives the application of the Purchaser Cap or the Seller Cap, as applicable,
as it relates to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall also
have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time
after such 30-day period upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified
Party, but only if the Indemnifying Party waives the application of the
Purchaser Cap or the Seller Cap, as applicable, as it relates to such Third-
Party Claim; provided that such later assumption of the defense would not
materially impair the rights of the Indemnified Party or the pending defense
of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, with the fees and
disbursements of such counsel being paid by the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such matter (except as set
forth below in this Section 11.3). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
shall have the sole discretion to control the defense of a matter as it
relates to Purchaser (i) in the event of a criminal matter involving Purchaser
or an equitable claim against Purchaser, (ii) if the Third-Party Claim is
made by a supplier, customer or employee of Seller, or (iii) if the Third-
Party Claim includes material claims for which the Purchaser provides Sellers
with written notice that it is not entitled to and will not claim
indemnification to the extent that it is not practical to separately defend
such claims. Purchaser shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in a
commercially reasonable manner and in the same manner as if it were not
entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the Third-Party
Claim on the terms provided above within such thirty (30) day period or to
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, then any
Losses subject to indemnification under this Agreement shall include the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party to the
extent incurred before any later assumption of such defense by the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 11.3. In any Third-Party
Claim for which indemnification is being sought hereunder the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such
matter, shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its
own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all times use reasonable
efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party (as the case may
be)

 



54  reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense
of which it is maintaining and shall cooperate in good faith with each other
with respect to the defense of any such matter, including the Indemnified
Party providing the Indemnifying Party with access to the Indemnified Partys
books, records and personnel during reasonable hours under the circumstances.

 

(b) If an Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim
in accordance with this Section 11.3, then the Indemnified Party shall not
settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
may settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of a
judgment with respect thereto as it relates to the Indemnified Party without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party
waives its right to be indemnified under this Agreement in writing and
satisfies all obligations of the Indemnified Party under such settlement,
compromise or judgment. If the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 11.3 then the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (i) such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from
all liability arising out of such claim and provided such release is not
conditioned on the Indemnifying Party indemnifying the Indemnified Party, or
(ii) the Indemnified Party waives its right to be indemnified under this
Agreement in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the amount of such settlement, compromise or consent shall in no
event determine the amount of Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall only be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
for Losses with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent such
indemnification would have been required by this Article XI absent such
settlement. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain
any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of
the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment
or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business
of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.

 

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant
hereto (whether or not resulting from a Third-Party Claim), such Indemnified
Party shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying
Party (a "Notice of Claim"). Such Notice of Claim shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such claim and the facts and circumstances regarding
such claim to the extent known by the Indemnified Party. The failure by any
Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim made pursuant to this Section 11.3(c) except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the failure
to receive such notice, it being understood that notices for claims in respect
of a breach of a representation or warranty must be delivered prior to the
expiration of

 



55  the survival period for such representation or warranty under Section 11.4.
In the event the Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, the Indemnified Party shall
attempt to establish the merits and amount of such claim (by litigation) and,
within five (5) Business Days following the final judicial determination from
which no appeal may be made of the merits and amount of the Indemnifying
Partys obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for Losses under this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party
immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined
hereunder.

Section 11.4. _Survival Period_. The representations and warranties of the
Parties contained herein shall not be extinguished by the Closing, but shall
survive the Closing for, and all claims for indemnification in connection
therewith shall be asserted not later than, twenty-four (24) months following
the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.3(c) and 4.3(e), 4.7,
4.15, the last sentence of 4.21(f), 4.28, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3(b), 5.5, 6.1, 6.2,
6.3(a) and (c), and 6.6 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations")
shall survive until 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of
business on the last day a claim for indemnification may be asserted
hereunder, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim
for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or
disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or
disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 11.5. _Liability Limits_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against Sellers for indemnification
under Section 11.1(b) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
pursuant to Section 11.1(b) exceeds an amount equal to One Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (the "Purchaser Basket"), in which event
Purchaser Indemnified Parties may claim indemnification for all Purchaser
Losses, including the initial One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,200,000) (subject to the other limitations herein); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Fundamental Representations shall not be subject to and shall not
count towards the Purchaser Basket. The total aggregate amount of the
liability of Sellers for Losses with respect to any claims made pursuant to
Section 11.1(b) shall be limited to Thirty Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($30,250,000) (the "Purchaser Cap"); provided, however, that the
total aggregate amount of the liability of Seller for Losses arising out of
intentional fraud or a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations shall
not be subject to any such limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, the total aggregate amount of the liability of Sellers
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding the Transition Services Agreement, the
MasterCard Services Agreement and the Money Transfer Services Agreement)
shall be limited to the Purchase Price.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller
Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against Purchaser for
indemnification under Section 11.2(c) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses pursuant to Section 11.2(c) exceeds an amount equal to One Million
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (the "Seller

 



56  Basket"), in which event Seller Indemnified Parties may claim
indemnification for all Seller Losses, including the initial One Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (subject to the other limitations
herein); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Fundamental Representations shall
not be subject to and shall not count towards the Seller Basket. The total
aggregate amount of the liability of Purchaser for Losses with respect to any
claims made pursuant to Section 11.2(c) shall be limited to Thirty Million Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($30,250,000) (the "Seller Cap"); provided,
however, that the total aggregate amount of the liability of Purchaser for
Losses arising out of intentional fraud or a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations shall not be subject to any such limits. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the total aggregate amount of the
liability of Purchaser under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Transition Services
Agreement, the MasterCard Services Agreement and the Money Transfer
Services Agreement) after the payment of the Purchase Price to Seller shall
be limited to the Purchase Price.

Section 11.6.  _Set-Off_. Purchaser shall be entitled to set-off any amount
or right it may be entitled to pursuant to this Agreement against any amount,
right or obligations owed to Sellers under this Agreement or any Seller
Ancillary Documents, including the Transition Services Agreement, the
MasterCard Services Agreement and the Money Transfer Services Agreement.
Sellers shall be entitled to set-off any amount or right it may be entitled to
pursuant to this Agreement against any amount, right or obligations owed to
Purchaser under this Agreement or any Purchaser Ancillary Documents, including
the Transition Services Agreement, the MasterCard Services Agreement and the
Money Transfer Services Agreement.

 

Section 11.7. _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of this Article 11, in
determining the amount of Losses (but not for purposes of determining whether
a breach or inaccuracy occurred) arising out of or relating to a breach of a
representation or warranty in this Agreement, all qualifications or exceptions
contained in such representation or warranty that use the words "material",
Material Adverse Effect or "material adverse effect" will be ignored and each
such representation and warranty will be read and interpreted without regard
to any such qualifications or exceptions.

 

Section 11.8. _Closing Net Working Capital; Reserves_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any Losses as a result
of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or undertaking of Seller or Shareholder and the amount of any
Losses incurred in respect of any such breach or inaccuracy shall not be
included in the calculation of aggregate Losses subject to the Purchaser
Basket and Purchaser Cap, to the extent that the amount of any Losses as a
result of such breach or inaccuracy is specifically included as a reduction
of any Current Asset, or as a Current Liability, or is reserved or accrued and
thereby is deducted from the Net Working Capital reflected on the Final Net
Working Capital Statement.

 

Section 11.9. _Insurance Benefits; Other Indemnification_. The Indemnified
Party agrees to, and to cause each of its Affiliates to, take commercially
reasonable steps to obtain any recovery available for Losses under the
insurance policies of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates before pursuing
any claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party; provided
that an Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification within any
time period required by this Agreement for the assertion of such claim. If an
Indemnified Party or its

 



57  Affiliates receive any amounts for such Losses under such insurance
policies, then the Indemnified Party agrees to, and to cause such Affiliates
to, reimburse the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the sum of: (a) the
amount received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under such
insurance policy with respect to such Losses, plus the amount of the Losses
paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates,
minus (b) the Losses subject to indemnification under this Agreement and the
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates in pursuing or obtaining such insurance recoveries (including
any increase to insurance premiums as a result of such recovery). For
clarity, (x) if the sum calculated in accordance with the previous sentence is
zero or a negative number, then the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates will
have no obligation to so reimburse the Indemnifying Party, and (y) the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates will not be obligated to reimburse an
Indemnifying Party an amount of insurance proceeds that exceeds the amount
that the Indemnifying Party previously paid to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates for such Losses.

Section 11.10. _Mitigation_. Each of Purchaser, Shareholder and Seller shall
take and shall cause its respective Affiliates to use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 

Section 11.11. _No Special Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, and except for Losses arising out of intentional fraud by
the applicable Indemnifying Party, Sellers and Purchaser shall not be liable
to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, for any consequential, incidental, special, exemplary,
or punitive damages or Losses of such other Person, damages or Losses in the
nature of lost profits or for diminution of value, or damages or Losses
determined as a multiple of income, revenue or the like, relating to any
indemnification obligation under this Agreement (except, in any such case, to
the extent that such damages are awarded to a third party in the case of a
Third Party Claim).

Section 11.12. _Waiver of Certain Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, neither Seller nor Shareholder shall be liable to
any Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising out of or relating
to (i) the Schedule 11.2(g) Contracts not being assigned to Purchaser on or
after the Closing, (ii) any action or inaction of Seller or Shareholder to
satisfy their obligations under Section 2.5, or (iii) otherwise arising out
of or relating to Purchasers inability to provide permitting-related products
and services to any of its Customers after the Closing as a result of
Purchaser not having in place any Contract or License required in order for
Purchaser to provide such products and services, in each case whether or not
such Losses result from a Third-Party Claim.

Section 11.13. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments made by Purchaser or Sellers pursuant to this Article 11 shall be
treated by all Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder.

Section 11.14. _Limitation of Remedies_. The rights of the Parties
for indemnification under this Agreement shall be strictly limited to those
contained in this Article 11 and Section 9.9 and, except in the case of
intentional fraud, such indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties after the Closing Date with respect to any matter in
any way

 



58  under or relating to this Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding the Transition Services Agreement, the MasterCard Services Agreement
and the Money Transfer Services Agreement). To the maximum extent permitted
by Law, Purchaser and Sellers hereby waive and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to waive, all other rights and remedies with respect to any such
matter, whether under any Laws or otherwise. Except as set forth in this
Article 11 and Section 9.9, no action, suit, claim, proceeding or remedy shall
be brought or maintained after the Closing Date by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party or any Seller Indemnified Party or their respective Affiliates,
against Seller or Shareholder, or Purchaser, as applicable, and no recourse
shall be brought or granted against Seller or Shareholder, or against
Purchaser, as applicable, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement
or omission or relating to a breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or undertakings of Seller,
Shareholder or Purchaser set forth or contained in this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any claim against
a Person to the extent that it shall have been the result of intentional fraud
by any such Person. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
provisions in this Agreement that limit any claims or remedies of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties,
including under this Article 11, have been bargained for and are reflected in
the Purchase Price negotiated in connection with this Agreement.
