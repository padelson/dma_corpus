proper Party. After the Parties' agreement upon the Final Settlement Statement
and subject to Section 2.4 and Section 3.6(b), (i) if either Party pays monies

shows the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Final Price"). The
Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. Seller shall, at Buyer's request, supply
reasonable documentation in its or its Affiliates' possession available to
support the actual revenue, expenses and other items for which adjustments are
made. As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, after
receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
"Dispute Notice"). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be
deemed waived, and Seller's determinations with respect to all such elements
of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the
Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller
will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and
will, without limiting Section 15.2(d), be final and binding on the Parties
and not subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price set forth
in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer,
the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall, without limiting
Section 15.2(d), be final and binding on the Parties hereto, subject to the
provisions of Section 2.3(b). Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as
paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final
Price shall be paid by the owing Party to the owed Party within ten (10) days
after final determination of such owed amounts in accordance herewith. All
amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be delivered in United States
currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the relevant Party.

(b)Subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant
to ARTICLE XIII and subject to Section 2.4, there shall be no adjustment for,
or obligation to pay, any revenues, proceeds, Operating Expenses or Designated
Well Costs between the Parties following the eighteen (18) month anniversary
of the Closing Date.

3.7Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice (if any), within fifteen (15) Business Days after
Buyer's delivery of a Dispute Notice, upon the written request of either Buyer
or Seller, Buyer and Seller shall engage the Denver office of KPMG LLP or such
other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator")
to resolve any such disputed matters set 

forth in the Dispute Notice (other than Disputed Title Matters and Disputed
Environmental Matters) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall within twenty-five (25) Business Days after Buyer's
delivery of such Dispute Notice summarize its position with regard to such
dispute in a written document and submit such summaries to the Accounting
Arbitrator, together with a copy of the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement
Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. The
Parties shall cooperate diligently with any reasonable request of the
Accounting Arbitrator in an effort to resolve the matters submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator as soon as reasonably possible after the Accounting
Arbitrator is engaged. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving the
Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a
written decision choosing either Seller's position or Buyer's position with
respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator as described above. Any decision
rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall, without limiting
Section 15.2(d), be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer, absent
fraud or manifest error, and will be enforceable against the Parties in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the disputes
presented to it, shall be limited to the procedures in this Section 3.7, may
not hear or decide any matters except the disputes presented to it and may not
award damages, interest, costs, attorneys' fees, expenses or penalties to
either Party. In addition, the Accounting Arbitrator shall agree in writing to
keep strictly confidential the specifics and existence of any matters
submitted as well as all proprietary records of the Parties, if any, reviewed
by the Accounting Arbitrator in the process of resolving such disputes.

3.8Allocation of Purchase Price/Allocated Values.

(a)Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the
Wells and the Well Locations as set forth in Schedule 3.8 to this Agreement
(the "Allocated Values"). Buyer and Seller agree that such allocation is
reasonable and, subject to Section 3.8(b), shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith, including in notices to Preferential Purchase Right
holders.

(b)Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under applicable federal
income tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values, within
thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement is
determined pursuant to Section 3.6 (the "Allocation"). If Seller and Buyer
reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (i) Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on
all Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and neither
Seller nor Buyer shall take any position on any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to concede, negotiate, compromise and/or
settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such
Allocation. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30)
days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement is finally determined,
then each Party shall be entitled to adopt its own position regarding the
Allocation; provided that such position shall, to the extent allowed under
applicable federal income tax Law, be consistent with the Allocated Values.

3.9Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 4.12, then the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to Section
3.3(a)(v), Section 3.3(a)(vi), Section 3.3(b)(vii) or Section 3.3(b)(viii), as
applicable, and Schedule 4.12 will be deemed amended immediately prior to
Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

Seller (or its Affiliate) as operator of those Assets or portions thereof that

successor operator of such Assets since the Assets or portions thereof may be
subject to operating or other agreements that control the appointment of a
successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that, as to the Assets it (or its
Affiliate) operates, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
support Buyer's efforts to become successor operator of such Assets (to the
extent permitted under any applicable joint operating agreement or other
applicable agreement) effective as of Closing (at Buyer's sole cost and

Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or any non-governmental Third Party
and relating to the Assets (the "Bonds") are transferable to Buyer. On or
before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the
name of Buyer, replacements for such Bonds to the extent such replacements are
necessary (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) to permit the cancellation of such Bonds posted by Seller and/or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Assets. In addition, at or prior to
Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of bonds or
other security with all applicable Governmental Authorities and all applicable
Third Parties meeting the requirements of such Governmental Authorities and
such Third Parties to own and, if applicable, operate the Assets.

(b)In the event that any Governmental Authority or any Third Party does not
permit the cancellation of any Bond posted by Seller and/or any Affiliate
thereof with respect to the Assets, then, from and after Closing, without
limiting Buyer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.2, Buyer
shall indemnify Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, against all amounts
incurred by Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, under such Bond (and all
costs incurred in connection with such Bond) to the extent applicable to the

any cash placed in escrow by Seller or any Affiliate thereof in connection
with the Bonds must be returned to Seller, and shall be deemed an Excluded
Asset for all purposes hereunder.

6.4Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the
Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter
hereafter arising which, if existing or known, as applicable, on the Execution
Date, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules.
For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining
whether the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII have been fulfilled, the
Schedules to Seller's representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto; provided, however, that if
Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition,
supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing shall be waived and Buyer shall
not be entitled to make a claim with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or otherwise.

6.5Records Retention. Buyer shall and shall cause its successors and assigns
to, for a period of five (5) years following Closing (or, in the case of
Records related to Tax matters, until the expiration of the period of time set
forth in the applicable statute of limitations), (a) retain the Records, (b)
provide Seller and its officers, employees and representatives with reasonable
access to the Records during normal business hours for review and copying at
Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller and its officers, employees and
representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to any indemnity claim
made under Article XIII for review and copying at Seller's expense. 

6.6Regulatory Matters.

(a)Seller and Buyer shall (x) make or cause to be made appropriate filings of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Execution Date, and Seller and
Buyer shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
filings and compliance with this Section 6.6, provided that Buyer and Seller
shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any filing fees in connection therewith,
and (y) use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond at the earliest
practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Authority, to take all
actions necessary to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
Laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date but in no event
later than the Outside Date, to resist in good faith, at each of their
respective cost and expense, any assertion that the transactions contemplated
hereby constitute a violation of Laws, and to eliminate every impediment under
any Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible in accordance herewith,
all to the end of expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. In connection with this Section 6.6, the Parties shall, to the extent
permitted by Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing, submission, investigation or inquiry, (ii) absent an
objection from a Governmental Authority, provide advance notice and allow the
other Party to participate in every communication with a Governmental
Authority, provided that this clause shall not apply to a communication
initiated by the Governmental Authority without advance notice to a Party, in
which case the next clause shall apply, (iii) promptly inform the other Party
of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
the DOJ or the FTC or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case, regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials to be
submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (v) consult with
each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference
with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. Each Party
shall provide the other with information that is reasonably requested and that
is reasonably necessary to obtain the expiration of the waiting period under
the HSR Act; provided, however, that neither Party would be required to share
information that (A) is subject to the attorney-client or work product
privilege, absent entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement or
(B) reflects the value of the transaction.

(b)Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
take reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is practicable but
in no event later than the Outside Date. Buyer and Seller shall jointly
determine all strategy with regard to any provision of the foregoing; provided
that nothing in this Agreement obligates Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise
take any action that limits the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates or Seller
or any of its Affiliates to operate or retain its own assets or businesses, or
the Assets. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action that will delay
obtaining the expiration of the HSR Act waiting period and neither shall
withdraw or refile any filing under the HSR Act without the approval of the
other Party.

6.7Compliance with Litigation Matters. Buyer agrees that it will comply with
the terms and requirements of the Bishop Litigation Settlement to the extent
relating to the post-Closing operations of the Assets, including (a) the
covenant to pay future royalties based on the royalty valuation methodology
agreed to in the Bishop Litigation Settlement, (b) the covenant to report
future royalties based on the reporting format 

agreed to in the Bishop Litigation Settlement, and (c) the covenant not to
take or adjust royalties for certain disputed deductions described in the
Bishop Litigation Settlement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer acknowledges that it is responsible for complying with the
terms and requirements of the Bishop Litigation Settlement to the extent
relating to the post-Closing operations of the Assets and agrees that Buyer
does not have any, and will not have any, claim against Seller relating to the
requirements of the Bishop Litigation Settlement, the results of such
compliance on operations or Buyer's failure to comply with such requirements.

6.8Employees.

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates may, on or after the Execution Date and at
reasonable times approved by Seller, interview any employee of Seller or its
Affiliates set forth on Schedule 6.8 (each, a "Permitted Employee") and
conduct those lawful, standard employee screening and eligibility procedures
with regard to the potential employment of any Permitted Employee as Buyer or
any such Affiliate conducts with respect to candidates for employment in its
ordinary course of business. Seller may supplement Schedule 6.8 at any time
prior to the Closing in order to add additional individuals to Schedule 6.8.
Buyer and its Affiliates may conduct interviews and screening of the Permitted
Employees from the Execution Date until fifteen (15) days before the Closing
Date; provided that such interviewing and screening shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business of Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates to
facilitate the completion of the interview and screening procedures hereunder.

(b)After the Execution Date, and as set forth in Section 6.8(a) above, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall be authorized to communicate with any Permitted
Employee regarding such Permitted Employee's potential employment with Buyer
or its Affiliates and both Buyer and its Affiliates shall be authorized to
communicate any offer of employment to any Permitted Employees, with such
employment offers to be conditioned upon the Closing and effective as of the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, not later than fifteen (15) days before the Closing
Date, deliver to Seller a final written list containing the name of each
Permitted Employee to whom Buyer or any of its Affiliates has made an
employment offer. Buyer shall provide to Seller, not later than ten (10) days
prior to the Closing Date, the names of each Permitted Employee who has then
accepted an employment offer from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each
Permitted Employee who accepts such an offer being a "Continuing Employee")
and the names of the Permitted Employees who have then declined an employment
offer from Buyer or its Affiliates. Each Continuing Employee shall, as of the
Closing Date (if he or she is still employed by Seller or its Affiliate), be
terminated by Seller or its Affiliate and become an employee of Buyer or its
Affiliate. Between the Execution Date and ten (10) days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to not) terminate any
Permitted Employee (other than for cause or with Buyer's prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
however, that prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates to not) terminate any Permitted Employee who has received an
employment offer from Buyer or any of its Affiliates and accepted such offer
(other than for cause or with Buyer's prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller shall not induce or
otherwise attempt to influence any such Permitted Employee to resign or to not
accept his or her offer of employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

(c)Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to
Continuing Employees arising on or prior to the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
the date a Continuing Employee ceases employment with Seller or its Affiliate)
and for all compensation and benefits owing to Permitted Employees not hired
by Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be
responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to Continuing Employees
arising on or after their hiring by Buyer or such Affiliate (including after
the Closing Date). Seller shall be responsible and pay for any obligation
arising out of the WARN Act with respect to any employee of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (including any Permitted 

Employees laid off on or prior to the Closing Date); provided that Buyer or
its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be responsible and pay for any obligation
arising out of the WARN Act with respect to any Continuing Employees laid off
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall take no act (or omit to take any act) on
or after the Closing Date that creates any Liability for Seller or any of its
Affiliates under the WARN Act.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer or its Affiliates
to (i) offer employment to, or hire, any Permitted Employee, (ii) offer or
provide specified levels of compensation or benefits to Permitted Employees or
(iii) continue the employment of any employee for any definite period
following the Closing Date.

(e)Without limiting the generality of Section 15.10, no provision in this
Agreement shall create any Third-Party beneficiary or other right in any
Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for any reason in
respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates or in respect of any benefits that may
be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement maintained
by Seller or Buyer or its Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.8, express or
implied, shall be deemed an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan providing
benefits to any Permitted Employee or any other employee of Seller or its
Affiliates. Each Party hereby agrees not to, and, with respect to Seller, to
cause its Affiliates or anyone acting on Seller's or any of its Affiliates'
behalf not to, and, with respect to Buyer, to cause each member of the ORNR
Group or anyone acting on Buyer's or any member of the ORNR Group's behalf not
to, for two (2) years after the Execution Date, directly or indirectly (other
than as permitted by Sections 6.8(a) and 6.8(b) hereof): solicit or contact
with a view to the engagement or employment of, any employee of the other
Party or its Affiliates; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation
of this Section 6.8(e) to engage in solicitations incidental to general
advertising or other general solicitation in the ordinary course not
specifically targeted at such Persons or to employ any Person not solicited in
violation hereof.

6.9Transition Services Agreement. The Parties shall enter into at Closing the
Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit K

AND IMPLEMENTED BY BUYER PURSUANT TO SECTION 15.2(f) (IN WHICH CASE BUYER CAN
RELY ON SUCH POSITION SOLELY FOR SUCH STRADDLE PERIOD) BUYER CANNOT RELY ON OR
FORM ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM SELLER'S METHODOLOGIES FOR THE DETERMINATION AND

BEGINNING AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT BUYER MUST MAKE ITS

ARTICLE XI

TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

11.1Seller's Title.

(a)General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title as set forth in the Assignment, Seller's
representations contained in Section 4.16 and the certificate delivered at
Closing pursuant to Section 9.3(k), and without limiting Buyer's remedies for
Title Defects set forth in this ARTICLE XI, Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
Seller's title to any of the Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect,
with respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in
Section 11.2 and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty
of title set forth in the Assignment.

(b)Special Warranty of Title. The Assignment delivered at Closing will contain
a special warranty of title whereby Seller warrants and agrees to defend
Defensible Title effective as of Closing and until the end of the Survival
Period, without duplication, to (i) each Well set forth on Exhibit B-1
(limited to any currently producing formations), (ii) each Well Location set
forth on Exhibit B-2 (limited to the applicable Target Formation(s) set forth
on Exhibit B-2 for such Well Location) and (iii) each SWD Well set forth on
Exhibit C, unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to
claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller or its
Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances; provided, however, that, except with respect to any liability of
Seller for any claim asserted in writing by Buyer to Seller in accordance with
Section 11.1(c) on or before the expiration of the Survival Period for breach
of such special warranty, such special warranty shall cease and terminate at
the end of such Survival Period.

(c)Recovery on Special Warranty. 

(i)Buyer's Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches. Prior to the expiration of
the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending at 5 p.m.
Mountain Time on the three (3) year anniversary thereof (the "Survival
Period"), Buyer shall furnish Seller a Title Defect Notice meeting the
requirements of Section 11.2(a) (other than the requirement to deliver by the
Defect Claim Date) setting forth any matters which Buyer intends to assert as
a breach of Seller's special warranty in the Assignment. For all purposes of
this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no
further liability for, any breach of Seller's special warranty that Buyer
fails to assert by a Title Defect Notice given to Seller on or before the
expiration of the Survival Period. Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity,
but not the obligation, to cure any special warranty breach asserted by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 11.1(c)(i). Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with
any attempt by Seller to cure any such special warranty breach.

(ii)Limitations on Special Warranty. For purposes of Seller's special warranty
of title contained in the Assignment, the value of the Wells, Well Locations
and/or SWD Wells set forth in Schedule 3.8, as appropriate ((1) for a Well,
limited to any currently producing formations, and (2) for a Well Location,
limited to the applicable Target Formation(s) set forth on Exhibit B-2 for
such Well Location), shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as
adjusted herein. Recovery on Seller's special warranty of title contained in
the Assignment shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing
thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer would
have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving rise to such breach of
Seller's special warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to the Defect Claim
Date pursuant to Section 11.2, except that the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not apply. Seller shall be
entitled to offset any amount owed by Seller for breach of the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment with respect to any Well, Well
Location or SWD Well by the amount of any Title Benefits with respect to such
Well, Well Location or SWD Well as to which Seller gives Buyer notice after
the Defect Claim Date which have not already been used to offset Title Defects
claimed by Buyer.

11.2Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(a)Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver, no later than forty-five (45)
days after the Execution Date (the "Defect Claim Date"), claim notices to
Seller meeting the requirements of this Section 11.2(a) (collectively, the
"Title Defect Notices" and, individually, a "Title Defect Notice") setting
forth any matters which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title
Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as Title Defects pursuant to this
Section 11.2(a). For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary (except for the special warranty of title
contained in the Assignment and except for Seller's representations contained
in Section 4.16 and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
9.3(k)), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no
Liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect
by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before
the Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in
writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and
the Well (including the legal description of such Well), the Well Location
(including the legal description of such Well Location, the affected Lease(s)
contributing to such Well Location, and the affected Target Formation(s) with
respect to such Well Location) or the SWD Well (including the legal
description of such SWD Well), or portion thereof, affected by such Title
Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Title Defect, and (iv) the
amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect and the computations
upon which Buyer's belief is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to
give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect
Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title Defects (as well as any claims
that would be claims under the special warranty set forth in the Assignment if
asserted after Closing) discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar
week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Defect Claim Date; provided that the 

failure to give such notice shall not preclude Buyer from asserting a Title
Defect on or before the Defect Claim Date or asserting a breach of Seller's
special warranty of title after the Closing Date.

(b)Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with respect to each
Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description
of the alleged Title Benefit and the Well (including the legal description of
such Well), the Well Location (including the legal description of such Well
Location, the affected Lease(s) contributing to such Well Location, and the
affected Target Formation(s) with respect to such Well Location) or the SWD
Well (including the legal description of such SWD Well), or portion thereof,
affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit Property"), and
(ii) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit and the
computations upon which Seller's belief is based. Except as set forth in
Section 11.1(c)(ii), Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits
for which a Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before the
Defect Claim Date.

(c)Seller's Right to Cure.

(i)Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to ninety (90) days after Closing (the
"Cure Period"), any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer and
which it has provided written notice of election to cure at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing. In the event that Seller elects to cure any
such Title Defect during the Cure Period, (x) the Title Defect Property
affected by such Title Defect shall be excluded from the transaction and (y)
the Purchase Price payable by Buyer to Seller shall be reduced at Closing by
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. Within ten (10) days after
the end of the Cure Period (or, if applicable, within ten (10) days following
the resolution of any dispute related to such Title Defect pursuant to Section
11.2(j)), and subject to Section 11.2(i), (A) if the remedy set forth in
Section 11.2(d)(i) is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Title
Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as
the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property minus the Title Defect Amount in respect
of any portion of such Title Defect that is not cured as determined pursuant
to Section 11.2(g) or Section 11.2(j), as applicable (provided that solely in
the case where such Title Defect Amount (x) is determined under Section
11.2(g)(ii) and (y) exceeds the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property,
then Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to such
excess over such Allocated Value), (B) if the remedy set forth in Section
11.2(d)(ii) is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Title Defect
Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the
Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property, and (C) if the remedy set forth in
Section 11.2(d)(iii) is elected, Seller shall retain the affected Title Defect
Property and such Title Defect Property shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder. Until such time as such Title Defect Property is
assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) above or retained by Seller
pursuant to clause (C) above, Seller shall continue to comply with the terms
of Section 6.1 with respect to such Title Defect Property.

(ii)During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Assets and all Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' possession or
control, together with a right to copy such Records at Seller's sole cost, in
order to facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any such Title Defects. An
election by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without
prejudice to its rights under Section 11.2(j) and shall not constitute an
admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect. 

(d)Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to (i)
attempt to cure any Title Defect for which it has elected to cure in
accordance with Section 11.2(c) and (ii) dispute the existence of a Title
Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, and
subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event
that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section
11.2(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing or the
end of the Cure Period (as applicable), then, subject to the Individual Title
Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, upon the election of Seller, at
its sole option (subject to Buyer's consent where applicable below):

(i)the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to Section 11.2(g) or Section 11.2(j);

(ii)subject to Buyer's consent (in its sole discretion), Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a
form and substance mutually agreed upon by the Parties (a "Title Indemnity
Agreement");

(iii)in the event the Title Defect Amount of any Title Defect equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property, Seller
shall retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Assets (in which case, such Assets
shall become Excluded Assets hereunder), in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property and such associated Assets; or

(iv)if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

(e)Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 11.2, as Seller's sole remedy, the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts of all Title Defects shall be reduced by an amount (the "Title
Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Title
Benefit Property caused by such Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to
Section 11.2(h) or Section 11.2(j).

(f)Exclusive Remedy. Except for (i) Buyer's rights under Seller's special
warranty of title in the Assignment, (ii) Seller's representations contained
in Section 4.16 and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
9.3(k), and (iii) Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section 11.2(d) shall be the
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Seller's failure to have
Defensible Title with respect to any Asset or any other title matter, and
Buyer hereby waives any and all other rights or remedies against Seller or its
Affiliates with respect thereto.

(g)Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" for such Title Defect Property and shall be
determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions (without
duplication):

(i)if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii)if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid
to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii)if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on Exhibit B-1, Exhibit B-2
or Exhibit C, as applicable, and there is a proportionate decrease in Seller's
Working Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net 

Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on Exhibit B-1, Exhibit B-2
or Exhibit C, as applicable;

(iv)if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

(v)the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vi)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE XI, except for
defects of the type described in Section 11.2(g)(ii), the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title
Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property.

(h)Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

(i)if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii)if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on Exhibit B-1, Exhibit B-2
or Exhibit C, as applicable, and there is a proportionate increase in Seller's
Working Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Benefit Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Benefit Property on Exhibit B-1, Exhibit B-2 or Exhibit C, as
applicable; and

(iii)if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected
by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(i)Title Defect Threshold and Deductible. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect
affecting one or more Assets for which the Title Defect Amounts do not exceed
$50,000 (the "Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall
there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the
Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller), plus (2) the aggregate
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall
be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies
available hereunder, but only to the extent that the amount by which the
aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds
the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies
Buyer with respect to any Title Defect Property pursuant to a Title Indemnity
Agreement or 

retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to Section 11.2(d)(iii) or
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to Section 12.1(c)(ii), in each case
the Title Defect Amount or Remediation Amount, as applicable, related to such
Title Defect Property or Environmental Defect Property will not be counted
towards the Aggregate Deductible.

(j)Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure an alleged Title Defect (the "Disputed Title
Matters") prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing
(or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure a Title
Defect after Closing), the Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to this Section 11.2(j). If any Disputed Title
Matter involving a Title Defect exists as of the Closing and if Seller does
not elect to cure any Title Defect that is the subject of such dispute during
the Cure Period, then (x) the Title Defect Property affected by such Disputed
Title Matter shall be excluded from the transaction and (y) the Purchase Price
payable to Seller shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property. If the Parties are unable to agree on any Title
Benefits and/or Title Benefit Amounts by the Closing, the affected Title
Benefit Property shall be conveyed to Buyer and the Purchase Price payable to
Seller at Closing shall not be adjusted by the Title Benefit Amounts in
dispute. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney
with at least fifteen (15) years' experience in oil and gas titles involving
properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties or the
Title Benefit Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer
and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing or the end of the Cure
Period, as applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado
office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator");
provided, however, that such Title Arbitrator must (A) have not been employed
by or represented either Party (or its Affiliate) in the past ten (10) years,
and (B) have no ethical conflict in serving as the Title Arbitrator. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Title Arbitrator its proposed resolution
of the Disputed Title Matter. The proposed resolution of the Disputed Title
Matter shall include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single
monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) to
settle the Disputed Title Matter. The Title Arbitrator shall be limited to
awarding only one or the other of the two proposed settlement amounts. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 11.2(j). The Title Arbitrator's determination shall be
made within twenty (20) days after submission of the Disputed Title Matters
and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination with respect to any Disputed Title Matter, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 11.2(g) and
Section 11.2(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater
Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its
applicable Title Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed Title Matter
submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect
to any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section
3.6(a), then, within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount
or a Title Benefit Amount, and, subject to Section 11.2(i), (A) with respect
to a Title Defect, (I) if the remedy set forth in Section 11.2(d)(i) is
elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Title Defect Property
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by Seller, an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property minus the
Title Defect 

Amount attributable to any portion of the Title Defect that was not cured or
that was determined by the Title Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 11.2(j)
to be owed to Buyer (provided that solely in the case where such Title Defect
Amount (x) is determined under Section 11.2(g)(ii) and (y) exceeds the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, then Seller shall pay to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by Buyer, an amount equal to such excess over such Allocated Value),
(II) if the remedy set forth in Section 11.2(d)(ii) is elected, Seller shall
assign to Buyer the affected Title Defect Property pursuant to an instrument
in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property, and (III) if the remedy set forth in Section
11.2(d)(iii) is elected, Seller shall retain the affected Title Defect
Property and such Title Defect Property shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder, and (B) with respect to a Title Benefit, any amount
due to Seller as a result of such Title Benefit, if any, shall be paid by
Buyer to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by Seller. Until such time as such Title Defect Property
is assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (I) or (II) above or retained by
Seller pursuant to clause (III) above, Seller shall continue to comply with
the terms of Section 6.1 with respect to such Title Defect Property. Nothing
herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 11.2(j). To the extent any
adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted at Closing pursuant to this Section 11.2(j) and
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made pursuant to
Section 3.6 or this Section 11.2(j).

11.3Casualty and Condemnation Loss.

(a)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert such matters
as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

(b)If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain and the reduction in value
attributable to such individual casualty or taking exceeds $100,000 (each, a
"Casualty Loss") (with the risk of casualty or takings below such threshold
belonging to Buyer), and the Closing thereafter occurs, such Casualty Loss
shall result in a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the
lesser of (i) the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) affected by such Casualty
Loss, and (ii) the amount of such Casualty Loss; provided, however, that to
the extent the amount of such Casualty Loss is greater than the downward
adjustments to the Purchase Price under this Section 11.3, Seller, at Closing,
shall pay to Buyer all sums actually paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason
of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign,
transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's right,
title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other
rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance
claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets; provided, however, that
(A) Buyer shall purchase the affected Assets at Closing notwithstanding such
Casualty Loss and (B) Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign
to Seller) all right, title, interest and claims against Third Parties for the
recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred prior to Closing in repairing
such Casualty Loss and/or pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or
other rights against Third Parties.

11.4Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

(a)With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in Schedule
4.10, Seller, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each such
Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right. 

(i)If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to which its
Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Asset subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Asset
affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded.
Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such
Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the
Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right on or
before the end of the period of time for closing such sale but not later than
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, (A) Seller shall so
notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded
from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, under the terms of this
Agreement and for a price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to such excluded Asset (or portion thereof)
and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment. If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential
Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not
been exercised or waived, then the Asset subject to such Preferential Purchase
Right shall be included in the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and
Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the terms of such
Preferential Purchase Right and shall be entitled to the proceeds, if any,
associated with the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right.

(ii)All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the holder thereof, in each
case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(b)With respect to each Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4, Seller, prior to
Closing, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent seeking
such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i)If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4 prior to
Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the assignment
of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable or (2) the
termination of a Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof (in either
case, a "Hard Consent"), or (B) a Consent requested by Seller is denied in
writing, then, in each case, the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such
un-obtained Consent shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer
at Closing, and as Buyer's exclusive remedy, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded.
In the event that a Consent (with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to
this Section 11.4(b)(i)) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained
within one hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, then, within ten (10)
days after such Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or
portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-
obtained Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded
and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment. Until the first to occur of such time as Seller has
assigned any Asset (or portion thereof) excluded pursuant to this Section
11.4(b)(i) or the expiration of such one hundred eighty- (180-) day period,
Seller shall continue to comply with the terms of Section 6.1 with respect to
such Asset (or portion thereof).

(ii)If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4 prior to
Closing and such Consent is not a Hard Consent and (B) such Consent requested
by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the Asset (or
portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be
assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets, without
adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Buyer shall have no claim against, and
Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent. 

(iii)Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 4.4; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay
any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer
agrees to provide Seller with any information or documentation that may be
reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third Party holder(s) of such
Consents in order to facilitate the process of obtaining such Consents.



ARTICLE XII

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

12.1Notice of Environmental Defects.

(a)Environmental Defects Notice. Buyer must deliver no later than the Defect
Claim Date claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this Section
12.1(a) (collectively, the "Environmental Defect Notices" and, individually,
an "Environmental Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in Buyer's
reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this Section 12.1. To be
effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental
Condition (including the applicable Environmental Law violated or implicated
thereby) and the Assets affected by such alleged Environmental Condition (the
"Environmental Defect Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or
portions thereof) affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably available to or prepared by Buyer reasonably
necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Environmental
Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in
reasonable detail) that Buyer reasonably asserts is necessary to Remediate
such alleged Environmental Condition. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any
Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section 12.1(a) shall
be limited to the Assets only, and Buyer shall not have the right to assert
environmental defects with respect to any other assets, properties or
operations. For all purposes of this Agreement (except for Seller's
representations in Section 4.18 and the certificate delivered at Closing
pursuant to Section 9.3(k)), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no liability for, (A) any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to
assert as an Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect
Notice delivered to Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date, and/or (B) any
environmental defect affecting any assets, properties or operations other than
the Assets (other than contribution requirements in accordance with the
applicable operating agreements), in each case, with such liabilities being
"Buyer's Environmental Liabilities." Buyer's calculation of the Remediation
Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable
detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that
gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all material
assumptions used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the
standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. To
give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental
Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before
the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice
of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Defect Claim Date; provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not preclude Buyer from asserting an Environmental Defect on or before
the Defect Claim Date.

(b)Seller's Right to Cure.

(i)Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to the expiration of the Cure Period,
any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer and which it
has provided written notice of election to cure at least two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing. In the event that Seller elects to cure any such
Environmental Defect during the Cure 

Period, (x) the Environmental Defect Property affected by such Environmental
Defect shall be excluded from the transaction, and (y) the Purchase Price
payable by Buyer to Seller shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value
of such Environmental Defect Property. Within ten (10) days after the end of
the Cure Period (or, if applicable, within ten (10) days following the
resolution of any dispute related to such Environmental Defect pursuant to
Section 12.1(f)), and subject to Section 12.1(e), (A) if the remedy set forth
in Section 12.1(c)(i) is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the
same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property minus the
Remediation Amount in respect of any portion of such Environmental Defect that
is not cured, (B) if the remedy set forth in Section 12.1(c)(iii) is elected,
Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Environmental Defect Property
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment,
and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property, and (C) if the remedy set forth in Section
12.1(c)(ii) is elected, Seller shall retain the affected Environmental Defect
Property and such Environmental Defect Property shall be deemed an Excluded
Asset for all purposes hereunder. Until such time as such Environmental Defect
Property is assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) above or retained
by Seller pursuant to clause (C) above, Seller shall continue to comply with
the terms of Section 6.1 with respect to such Environmental Defect Property.

(ii)During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Assets and all Records in Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' possession or
control in order to facilitate Seller's attempt to cure any such Environmental
Defects. An election by Seller to attempt to cure an Environmental Defect
shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section 12.1(f) and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Seller's right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged
Environmental Defect.

(c)Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
(i) attempt to cure any Environmental Defect for which it has elected to cure
in accordance with Section 12.1(b) and (ii) dispute the existence of an
Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect
thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(c),
in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with Section 12.1(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on
or before Closing or the end of the Cure Period (as applicable), then, subject
to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, upon
the election of Seller, at its sole option (subject to Buyer's consent or
election where applicable below), elect one of the following:

(i)the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Remediation Amount agreed upon
by the Parties or determined pursuant to Section 12.1(f);

(ii)in the event the Remediation Amount of any Environmental Defect equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value of the applicable Environmental Defect Property,
Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets (in which case, such
Assets shall become Excluded Assets hereunder), in which event the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset
and such associated Assets;

(iii)subject to Buyer's consent (in its sole discretion), Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental Defect
with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form and
substance mutually agreeable to the Parties (each, an "Environmental Indemnity
Agreement"); or

(iv)if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c); 

provided, however, that if the Remediation Amount for such Environmental
Defect Property equals or exceeds the Allocated Value for such Environmental
Defect Property, either Party shall have the right to elect to have the option
set forth in Section 12.1(c)(ii) apply with respect to such Environmental
Defect Property.

If the option set forth in Section 12.1(c)(i) applies, Buyer shall be deemed
to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses attributable
to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to such
Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and such
responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed
Obligations hereunder.

(d)Exclusive Remedy. Except for (i) Seller's representation contained in
Section 4.18 and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
9.3(k), and (ii) Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section 12.1(c) shall be the
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect
with respect to any Asset or any other environmental matter, and Buyer hereby
waives any and all other rights and remedies against Seller with respect
thereto.

(e)Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
(i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect affecting
one or more Assets for which the Remediation Amounts do not exceed $100,000
(the "Individual Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there
be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the
Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the
aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed
the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation Amounts
attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), plus (2) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after
which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the
amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title
Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt,
if Seller indemnifies Buyer with respect to any Assets pursuant to an
Environmental Indemnity Agreement or retains any Assets pursuant to Section
12.1(c)(ii), the Remediation Amounts relating to such indemnified or retained
Assets will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible.

(f)Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing and
(ii) the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted Environmental Defect
prior to the end of the Cure Period (items (i) and (ii), collectively, the
"Disputed Environmental Matters"). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure
an asserted Environmental Defect after Closing), the Disputed Environmental
Matters shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to
this Section 12.1(f). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing (or
by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure an
Environmental Defect after Closing), the Disputed Environmental Matters shall
be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 12.1(f). If any
Disputed Environmental Matter involving an Environmental Defect exists as of
the Closing and if Seller does not elect to cure any Environmental Defect that
is the subject of such dispute during the Cure Period, then (x) the
Environmental Defect Property affected by such Disputed Environmental Matter
shall be excluded from the transaction and (y) the Purchase Price payable to
Seller shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall
be an environmental attorney with at least fifteen (15) years' experience in
environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in the
regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and 

Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date or the end of the Cure
Period, as applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado
office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Environmental
Arbitrator"); provided, however, that such Environmental Arbitrator must (A)
have not been employed by or represented either Party (or its Affiliate) in
the past ten (10) years, and (B) have no ethical conflict in serving as the
Environmental Arbitrator. Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the
Environmental Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Disputed Environmental
Matter. The proposed resolution of the Disputed Environmental Matter shall
include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single monetary amount
that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) to settle the
Disputed Environmental Matter. The Environmental Arbitrator shall be limited
to awarding only one or the other of the two proposed settlement amounts. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 12.1. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall
be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the
rules set forth in this Section 12.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator
are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the
Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect
Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific Disputed Environmental Matters submitted
by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Arbitrator. Each of
Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Environmental
Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or Section 3.6(a),
then, within ten (10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to any Remediation
Amount, and, subject to Section 12.1(e), (A) if the remedy set forth in
Section 12.1(c)(i) is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected
Environmental Defect Property excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property minus the Remediation Amount attributable to any
portion of the Environmental Defect that was not cured or that was determined
by the Environmental Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 12.1(f) to be owed to
Buyer, (II) if the remedy set forth in Section 12.1(c)(iii) is elected, Seller
shall assign to Buyer the affected Environmental Defect Property pursuant to
an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer
shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified in writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such Environmental Defect Property, and (III) if the remedy set forth in
Section 12.1(c)(ii) is elected, Seller shall retain the affected Environmental
Defect Property and such Environmental Defect Property shall be deemed an
Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. Until such time as such
Environmental Defect Property is assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (I) or
(II) above or retained by Seller pursuant to clause (III) above, Seller shall
continue to comply with the terms of Section 6.1 with respect to such
Environmental Defect Property. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing
to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section
12.1(f). To the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as
of Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing pursuant to this
Section 12.1(f) and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will
be made pursuant to Section 3.6 or this Section 12.1(f).

12.2NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the
Assets have been used for exploration, development and production of oil and
gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other
substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with 

the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos,
NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the
inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The
wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets
may contain NORM, asbestos and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM
containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come
in contact with various environmental media, including water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation,
removal, transportation or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos,
NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets. The presence of NORM or
asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable cannot be claimed as an
Environmental Defect, except to the extent constituting a violation of
Environmental Laws.



ARTICLE XIII

ASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

13.1Assumption by Buyer. Other than the Retained Liabilities (each only for
the period of its respective survival pursuant to Section 13.8) and without
limiting Buyer's rights to indemnity under this ARTICLE XIII, from and after
Closing, Buyer assumes and hereby agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and
discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed, paid and discharged) all
obligations and Liabilities, known or unknown, arising from, based upon,
related to or associated with the Assets, regardless of whether such
obligations or Liabilities arose prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including obligations and Liabilities relating in any manner to the use,
ownership or operation of the Assets, including obligations (a) to furnish
makeup gas and/or settle Imbalances according to the terms of applicable gas
sales, processing, gathering or transportation Contracts, (b) to pay Working
Interests, royalties, overriding royalties and other interest owners' revenues
or proceeds attributable to sales of Hydrocarbons, including those held in
suspense (including those amounts for which the Purchase Price was adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ix)), (c) to Decommission the Assets (the
"Decommissioning Obligations"), (d) to clean up and/or remediate the Assets in
accordance with applicable Contracts and Laws, (e) to perform all obligations
applicable to or imposed on the lessee, owner or operator under the Leases and
the Applicable Contracts, or as required by Law, and (f) subject to ARTICLE
XII, relating to Environmental Conditions, Environmental Defects and Buyer's
Environmental Liabilities (all of said obligations and Liabilities described
in this Section 13.1, including in clauses (a) through (f), herein being
referred to as the "Assumed Obligations").

13.2Indemnities of Seller. Effective as of Closing, subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 13.4 and Section 13.8 or otherwise contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis, and
hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Buyer
and its Affiliates, and all of its and their respective equityholders,
partners, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys,
consultants, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") from and against any and all Liabilities, whether or not relating to
Third Party Claims or incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the
same or in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of their respective rights
hereunder, arising from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a)any breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained
in ARTICLE IV;

(b)any breach by Seller of any of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement;

(c)any Retained Liabilities; or

(d)any and all Seller Taxes.

13.3Indemnities of Buyer. Effective as of Closing, Buyer and its successors
and assigns shall assume and be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis,
and hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release
Seller and its Affiliates, and all of its and their respective equityholders,
partners, 

members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, consultants,
agents and representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties")
from and against any and all Liabilities, whether or not relating to Third
Party Claims or incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or
in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of their respective rights
hereunder, arising from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a)any breach by Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained
in ARTICLE V;

(b)any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement; or

(c)the Assumed Obligations.

13.4Limitation on Liability.

(a)Seller shall not have any Liability for any indemnification under Section
13.2(a) of this Agreement (other than Liabilities with respect to any breach
of the Specified Representations or the representations or warranties in
Section 4.14) (i) for any individual Liability unless the amount with respect
to such Liability exceeds $100,000 (the "Individual Indemnity Threshold"), and
(ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of all such Liabilities (that
exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold and for which Claim Notices are
timely delivered pursuant to Section 13.7) exceeds the Indemnity Deductible,
and then only to the extent such Liabilities exceed the Indemnity Deductible.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer for aggregate Liabilities for
any indemnification under Section 13.2(a) of this Agreement (other than
Liabilities with respect to any breach of the Specified Representations or the
representations or warranties in Section 4.14) in excess of an amount equal to
twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall never be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
for aggregate Liabilities in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the
Purchase Price (inclusive of the aggregate damages for which Buyer may be
indemnified pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, which are limited
to twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price).

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer under Section 13.2(a) for any
Asset Tax (or portion thereof) allocable to Buyer under Section 15.2 as a
result of a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section
4.14, except to the extent the amount of such Asset Tax (or portion thereof)
exceeds the amount that would have been due absent such breach.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for
purposes of calculating the amount of any damages caused by, arising out of or
resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty in ARTICLE IV or
ARTICLE V, the representations and warranties shall, for purposes of this
ARTICLE XIII, be read without giving effect to any qualifiers as to
materiality contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such
representation or warranty.

13.5Express Negligence. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN SECTION 10.1, THE
DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, RELEASE AND ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS
PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT
THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR
RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT
OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW
OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS "CONSPICUOUS."

13.6Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from and after Closing, Section 6.3,
Section 6.10(d), Section 10.1, Section 11.1(c), 

Section 13.2, Section 13.3, Section 15.17 and Section 15.19(c), and any Title
Indemnity Agreement or Environmental Indemnity Agreement entered into by the
Parties, contain the Parties' exclusive remedies against each other with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including breaches of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained
in this Agreement or in any document or certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Except as specified in Section 11.1(c), Section 13.2, Section 15.17
and any Title Indemnity Agreement or Environmental Indemnity Agreement entered
into by the Parties, effective as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever
discharges Seller and its Affiliates and all of such Persons' equityholders,
partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
damages, losses, costs, Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever,
at law or in equity, known or unknown, which Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified
Parties might now or subsequently have, based on, relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
ownership, use or operation of any of the Assets prior to Closing or the
condition, quality, status or nature of any of the Assets prior to Closing,
including rights to contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and any similar
Environmental Law, breaches of statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or
other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights of
contribution and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (except as provided in Section 11.3(b)).

13.7Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Section
6.3, Section 6.10(d), Section 10.1, Section 13.2, Section 13.3, Section 15.17
and Section 15.19(c) shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a)For purposes of Section 6.3, Section 6.10(d), Section 10.1, this ARTICLE
XIII, Section 15.17 or Section 15.19(c), the term "Indemnifying Party" when
used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties
having an obligation to indemnify the other Party and/or other Persons with
respect to such Liabilities pursuant to Section 6.3, Section 6.10(d), Section
10.1, this ARTICLE XIII, Section 15.17 or Section 15.19(c), and the term
"Indemnified Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall
mean the Party and/or other Persons having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 6.3,
Section 6.10(d), Section 10.1, this ARTICLE XIII, Section 15.17 or Section
15.19(c).

(b)To make a claim for indemnification under Section 6.3, Section 6.10(d),
Section 10.1, Section 13.2, Section 13.3, Section 15.17 or Section 15.19(c),
an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its
claim under this Section 13.7, including the specific details of and specific
basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event
that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party
against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure
of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in
this Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under Section 6.3, Section 6.10(d), Section 10.1, Section 13.2,
Section 13.3, Section 15.17 or Section 15.19(c) (as applicable) except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c)In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such 

Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

(d)If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and expense,
the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim
which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement
of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e)If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right
of the Indemnifying Party to admit its obligation and assume the defense of
the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof. If settlement has been offered and the Indemnifying Party has not yet
admitted its obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall
have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i)
admit in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and
against the liability and consent to such settlement, (ii) if liability is so
admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or
(iii) deny liability. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such
notice shall be deemed to be an election under subsection (iii) above.

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes
the claim for such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
disputed the claim for such Liabilities.

13.8Survival.

(a)Except for the Specified Representations and the representations and
warranties in Section 4.14, the representations and warranties of the Parties
in ARTICLE IV and ARTICLE V and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in
Section 6.1 and Section 9.4 shall survive Closing for a period of twelve (12)
months. The Specified Representations shall survive Closing without time
limit. The representations and warranties in Section 4.14 shall survive the
Closing for the applicable statute of limitations period plus thirty (30)
days. Except as otherwise set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section
13.8(a) or in Section 13.8(b), all covenants and agreements to be performed at
or prior to Closing shall terminate as of Closing and all other covenants
shall survive Closing until fully performed. Representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall be of no further force or effect after the date
of their expiration; provided 

that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

(b)The indemnities in Section 13.2(a), Section 13.2(b), Section 13.3(a) and
Section 13.3(b) shall terminate as of the expiration date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or
before such expiration date. Seller's indemnities in Section 13.2(c) shall
survive Closing for a period of three (3) years (except for Seller's indemnity
with respect to clause (h) of Retained Liabilities which shall survive Closing
for a period of eighteen (18) months). Seller's indemnities in Section 13.2(d)
and Section 15.17 shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations period plus thirty (30) days. Buyer's indemnities in Section 15.17
shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of limitations period
plus thirty (30) days. Buyer's indemnities in Section 6.3, Section 6.10(d),
Section 10.1, Section 13.3(c) and Section 15.19(c) shall survive Closing
without time limit.

13.9Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.10Limitations on Damages.

(a)The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in connection
with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be reduced by any corresponding insurance proceeds from insurance policies
carried by a Party realized or that could reasonably be expected to be
realized by such Party if a claim were properly pursued under the relevant
insurance arrangements.

(b)The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
or resolve any Liabilities subject to indemnification under this ARTICLE XIII.

13.11Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, or damages
for lost profits of any kind arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any
such Party suffers such damages to a Third Party, which damages (including
costs of defense and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to
recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of
each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of the
Seller Indemnified Parties, waive any right to recover special, indirect,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, or damages
for lost profits of any kind, arising in connection with or with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.12Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby. 



ARTICLE XIV

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

14.1Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

(a)by Seller, at its option, if any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VIII (other than the conditions set forth in Section 8.3, Section 8.4 or
Section 8.7) have not been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date
and, following written notice thereof from Seller to Buyer specifying the
reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by Buyer of this
Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten (10)
Business Days after Buyer's receipt of written notice thereof from Seller;

(b)by Buyer, at Buyer's option, if any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VII (other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.3, Section 7.4 or
Section 7.6) have not been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date
and, following written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller specifying the
reason such condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by Seller of this
Agreement), such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten (10)
Business Days after Seller's receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer;

(c)by Buyer if the condition set forth in Section 7.4 has not been satisfied
on or before the Scheduled Closing Date or by Seller if the condition set
forth in Section 8.4 is not satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date;

(d)by Seller or Buyer if Closing shall not have occurred on or before November
15, 2017 (or such later date as agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer) (the
"Outside Date"); or

(e)by Seller if Buyer has not deposited the Deposit (by wire transfer in same
day funds) with the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days after the
Execution Date;

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (d) above if such Party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

14.2Effect of Termination.

(a)If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section 14.1 hereof, then, except
as provided in Section 3.2 and except for the provisions of Sections 6.8(e),
6.10(b) through (h), 6.11 (only the last sentence thereof), 10.1(e) through
(i), 10.2, 10.3, 12.2, 13.11, this Section 14.2, Section 14.3, ARTICLE I and
ARTICLE XV (other than Sections 15.2(b) through (j), 15.3, 15.7, 15.8, 15.15,
15.17 and 15.19) and such of the defined terms set forth in Appendix I to give
context to such Sections, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and the
Parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder.

(b)If Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1(a), (i) all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set
forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set
forth in ARTICLE VII at Closing) have been met, or waived by Buyer, and (ii)
Seller is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under Section
9.3, then, in such event, Seller shall have the right to, at its option,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(a) and the Parties shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to Seller together with
any interest or income thereon, free of any claims by Buyer with respect
thereto as liquidated damages and as Seller's sole and exclusive remedy,
except that Seller shall continue to be entitled to recover from Buyer any and
all damages and Liabilities suffered by Seller in connection with the
Specified Hedging Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby pursuant
to the Hedging Indemnities. The provision for payment of liquidated damages in
this Section 14.2(b) has been 

included because, in the event of a termination of this Agreement permitting
Seller to receive the Deposit, the actual damages to be incurred by Seller can
reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of liquidated damages called
for herein and because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult if
not impossible to measure accurately.

(c)If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
14.1(b), (i) all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set
forth in ARTICLE VIII (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set
forth in ARTICLE VIII at Closing) have been met, or waived by Seller, and (ii)
Buyer is ready, willing and able to perform its obligations under Section 9.3,
then, in such event, Buyer shall have the right to, at its option, (1)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(b) and the Parties shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to Buyer, free of any
claims by Seller with respect thereto after the termination of this Agreement,
or (2) seek all remedies available at law or in equity, including specific
performance by Seller.

(d)If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written agreement of the
Parties, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to Section 14.1
(other than Section 14.1(e)) and the Closing does not occur on or before the
Closing Date for any reason other than as set forth in Section 14.2(b) or
Section 14.2(c), then Buyer shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit,
free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto after the termination of
this Agreement and the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
the Deposit to Buyer.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, Seller shall be entitled to recover
from Buyer any and all damages and Liabilities suffered by Seller in
connection with the Specified Hedging Agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby pursuant to the Hedging Indemnities.

14.3Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall destroy or return to Seller all title, engineering,
geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports,
maps and other information (including any confidential information or digital
Records) furnished by or on behalf of Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on
behalf of Buyer in connection with its due diligence investigation of the
Assets, in each case in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, but if
Buyer elects to destroy any such information, an officer of Buyer shall
certify same to Seller in writing.



ARTICLE XV

MISCELLANEOUS

15.1Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules. All of the Appendices, Exhibits and
Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each Party to
this Agreement and its counsel have received a complete set of Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the Execution Date.

15.2Expenses and Taxes.

(a)Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and
expenses.

(b)Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to 

the Effective Time. Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes
attributable to (x) any Tax period beginning at or after the Effective Time
and (y) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time.

(c)For purposes of determining the allocations described in Section 15.2(b),
(i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of
Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (iii), below)
shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or
related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than
such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) or (iii)), shall be allocated to the
period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and
(iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed
on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time
by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
on the one hand, and the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on
or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15.2(c) to the contrary, (1) the
portion of Gross Products Taxes based on the value of 2016 production of
Hydrocarbons (and payable in 2017 and 2018) attributable to 2016 production
shall be allocated to Seller and (2) the portion of Gross Products Taxes based
on the value of 2017 production of Hydrocarbons (and payable in 2018 and 2019)
attributable to 2017 production that occurs prior to the Effective Time shall
be allocated to Seller, and the portion of such Gross Products Taxes
attributable to 2017 production that occurs from and after the Effective Time
shall be allocated to Buyer.

(d)To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time an
adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to Section
3.3, Section 3.5 and Section 3.6, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the
most recent information available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax
for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset
Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to Section 3.6, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax
that is allocable to such Party under this Section 15.2.

(e)The Parties recognize and acknowledge that, for purposes of Income Taxes,
Seller will remain the owner of the Assets for all taxable periods or portions
thereof ending before the Closing, and accordingly Seller (i) must include in
its federal and any state or local Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes
all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit related to the ownership
or operation of the Assets that are allocable to taxable periods and portions
thereof ending prior to the Closing and (ii) shall be liable for and shall
bear all Income Taxes imposed by reason of such inclusions, and Buyer shall
have no liability or responsibility for any such Income Taxes.

(f)Subject to Buyer's indemnification rights under Section 13.2, after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) prepare and file with the appropriate Taxing
Authority any and all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date
with respect to Asset Taxes, (ii) submit each such Tax Return that relates to
a Straddle Period or to a Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time to
Seller for its review and comment reasonably in advance of the due date
therefor, and (iii) timely file any such Tax Return, incorporating any
reasonable comments received from Seller (with respect to Tax Returns relating
to a Straddle Period or to a Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time)
prior to the due date therefor. Buyer shall pay the Asset Taxes reflected on
such Tax Returns and Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer the amount of any
Seller Taxes paid with respect to such Tax Returns. The Parties agree that (x)
this Section 15.2(f) is intended to solely address the timing and manner in
which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset
Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, and (y)
nothing in this Section 15.2(f) shall 

be interpreted as altering the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to
and economically borne by the Parties (except for any penalties, interest or
additions to Tax imposed as a result of any breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this Section 15.2(f), which shall be borne by Buyer).

(g)All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer shall be
borne solely by Buyer. Any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the
transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

(h)Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes allocated to
Seller pursuant to Section 15.2(b) and Section 15.2(c), and Buyer shall be
entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to
Section 15.2(b) and Section 15.2(c); provided, however, that neither Seller
nor Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Asset Taxes allocated to it
pursuant to Section 15.2(b) if Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, did not
pay or otherwise economically bear such Asset Taxes. If a Party or its
Affiliate receives a refund of Asset Taxes to which the other Party is
entitled pursuant to this Section 15.2(h), such recipient Party shall forward
to the entitled Party the amount of such refund within thirty (30) days after
such refund is received, net of any reasonable, out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by such recipient Party in procuring such refund.

(i)The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to
any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. The
Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(j)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
becomes entitled, pursuant to Section 3.6(b), to any amounts earned from the
sale of Hydrocarbons, which amounts are received after the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be allocated and bear all Asset
Taxes attributable to the production of such Hydrocarbons or the receipt of
proceeds therefrom notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were produced prior
to the Effective Time.

15.3Assignment. Subject to the provisions of Section 15.17, this Agreement may
not be assigned by Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of the
other Party. Any assignment or delegation made without the consents required
hereby shall be void. In the event a Party consents to any such assignment,
such assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and
responsibilities hereunder, including obligations and responsibilities arising
following such assignment. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its
successors and assigns of any of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer or its
successors or assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity
obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so assigned or transferred.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Buyer remaining liable for its
obligations (including indemnity obligations) hereunder, Buyer may direct that
the Assets be assigned to one or more of the other members of the ORNR Group;
provided that such applicable members of the ORNR Group expressly agree,
pursuant to an instrument in favor of and reasonably acceptable to Seller and
without releasing Buyer 

hereunder, to assume and be directly responsible for all of Buyer's
obligations hereunder as to the Assets so assigned.

15.4Preparation of Agreement. Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of any
ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the identity
of the draftsman of this Agreement.

15.5Publicity. Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with each other with
regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements issued
or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by applicable Laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or stock
exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such press release or other
public or private announcement without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties shall
be obligated to hold all specific terms and provisions of this Agreement
strictly confidential after the Closing; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not (a) restrict disclosures by Buyer or Seller that are required by
applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its
Affiliates, provided that such disclosures shall be made only to the extent
required thereunder, (b) prevent Buyer or Seller from recording the
Assignment, the Deed and any federal or state assignments delivered at Closing
or from complying with any disclosure requirements of Governmental Authorities
that are applicable to the transfer of the Assets from Seller to Buyer, (c)
prevent Buyer or Seller from making any disclosure of information relating to
this Agreement if made in a manner, under conditions and to Persons that would
be permitted under the Confidentiality Agreement so long as such Person
continues to hold such information confidential on the same terms as set forth
in this Section 15.5 and (d) prevent Seller from making disclosures in
connection with complying with Preferential Purchase Rights and other transfer
restrictions applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

15.6Notices. All notices and communications required or permitted to be given
hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be delivered personally, or sent
by bonded overnight courier, or mailed by U.S. Express Mail, Federal Express
or United Parcel Service Express Delivery or by certified or registered United
States Mail with all postage fully prepaid, or sent by electronic mail

cause of action that would otherwise be included in the Assets pursuant to
Section 2.1(l) but is not transferable.

required by any Governmental Authority in order to obtain such unconditional
approval, including the posting of any and all bonds or other security that
may be required in excess of its existing lease, pipeline or area-wide bonds.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their respective

any disputes between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any
state or federal court in Dallas, Texas, and each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any proceeding
arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that
the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court or jurisdiction 

other than the above specified courts. The Parties further agree, to the
extent permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a
Party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(c)To the extent that either Party or any of its Affiliates has acquired, or
hereafter may acquire, any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal

Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable

be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of New York, excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that
might refer construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(e)THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

15.14Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

15.15Removal of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate, or cause to be
eliminated, the names "QEP", "QEP Energy" and any variations thereof from the

usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names
belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

15.16Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

15.17Like-Kind Exchange. Buyer and Seller agree that either or both of Seller
and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an
exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an "Exchange");
provided that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of the Exchange. 

Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party
in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the
procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and Buyer shall have
the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its rights
under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange
accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Service
Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that neither an assignment of a Party's rights under this Agreement nor
any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in connection with the
Exchange shall release either Party from, or modify, any of its liabilities
and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this
Agreement, and neither Party makes any representations as to any particular
tax treatment that may be afforded to the other Party by reason of such
assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange. The
Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an Exchange
shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result
of the Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the other Party,
the Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated
with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold the other Party, its Affiliates,
and their respective former, current and future partners, members,
shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all Liabilities arising out
of, based upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or transactions
or actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been
incurred by the other Party but for the electing Party's Exchange election.

15.18Specific Performance. Subject to Section 14.2, the Parties agree that if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by a Party in
accordance with their specific terms, the other Party shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
available at law or in equity.

15.19Financial Statements.

(a)Seller acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates may be required to
include statements of revenues and direct operating expenses and other
financial information relating to the Assets for up to three (3) years (or
interim periods within the three (3) year period) ending on, or including, the
Closing (collectively, the "Consolidated Financial Statements") in documents
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), and that such Consolidated Financial Statements may be
required to be audited in accordance with GAAP and may need to comply with the
requirements of one or more registration statements, reports or other
documents (collectively, the "SEC Documents") required to be filed by Buyer or
its Affiliates under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the rules set forth in Regulation S-X, or
other rules promulgated thereunder. From and after the Closing Date and for
only up to three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and will
cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
accountants and counsel to assist Buyer and its Affiliates in preparing and
obtaining the Consolidated Financial Statements. Buyer shall be responsible
for, and obligated to promptly reimburse Seller for, all reasonable costs and
expenses (including third person or internal resources and personnel) incurred
by Seller or its Affiliates to the extent associated with preparing and
obtaining the Consolidated Financial Statements and otherwise complying with
this Section 15.19. From and after the Closing Date and for only up to three
(3) years after the Closing Date, following reasonable advance notice from
Buyer to Seller, Seller shall provide Buyer and its Affiliates and their
respective representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
such records (including original source materials underlying such records), to
the extent such information is available, and personnel of Seller and its
Affiliates and its accounting firms and/or counsel as Buyer may reasonably
request to enable Buyer and its representatives to create and audit the
Consolidated Financial Statements. From and after the Closing Date and for
only up to three (3) years after the Closing Date, to the extent requested by
Buyer, Seller will 

use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain representation letters and
similar documents (in each case, in form and substance customary for
representation letters provided to external audit firms by management of a
company whose financial statements are the subject of an audit used in filings
of acquired company financial statements under the Exchange Act) from
applicable personnel of Seller and its Affiliates as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation and audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. From and after the Closing Date and for only up to three
(3) years after the Closing Date, to the extent requested by Buyer, Seller
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide and request that the
independent audit firm that audits the Consolidated Financial Statements
provide consents necessary for the inclusion or incorporation by reference of
the Consolidated Financial Statements in any SEC Document in which the
Consolidated Financial Statements are required to be included or incorporated.
Except to the extent included in any filings made pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, Buyer agrees to hold all information provided to
Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 15.19 confidential and
agrees not to use any such information other than in connection with the
preparation of any such filings, provided, however, that Buyer may disclose
the information (i) to any representative of Buyer but only to the extent such
representative needs to know such information for Buyer's purpose of preparing
the Consolidated Financial Statement; provided that (A) Buyer shall advise
each such representative of the confidential nature of the information, (B)
Buyer shall be responsible for each such representative's compliance with the
terms of this Agreement binding on Buyer, and (C) Buyer shall take reasonable
measures to cause its representatives to comply with the terms of this
Agreement binding on Buyer; or (ii) to the extent that Buyer or such
representative is required to disclose such information in order to avoid
committing a violation of any Law, or governmental rule or regulation,
including any rules or regulations of any securities association, stock
exchange or national securities quotation system, provided that Buyer provides
prompt advance written notice to Seller of the proposed disclosure.

(b)Except for the information that will be contained in the representation
letters referred to above, all of the information to be provided by Seller or
its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 15.19 will be given without any
representation or warranty, express or implied, and no Seller Indemnified
Party shall have any liability or responsibility with respect thereto.

(c)Buyer, for itself and for each member of the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
hereby releases, defends, indemnifies, remises and forever discharges each
member of the Seller Indemnified Parties from any and all suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs,
Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, at law or in equity,
known or unknown, which any member of the Buyer Indemnified Parties might now
or subsequently may have, based on or arising out of the information provided
by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 15.19.

15.20No Financing Source Liability. None of the Financing Sources will have
any liability to any member of the Seller Indemnified Parties relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or the Financing, whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and none of the Seller Indemnified Parties
will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder,
under the Transaction Documents, or otherwise in connection with the
Financing, and Seller hereby waives any rights or claims that it has or may
have on its behalf and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties. Seller
hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action, claim, cause of
action or similar claims or assertions of any kind or description arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources with respect to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
