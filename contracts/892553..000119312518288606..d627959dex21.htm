Chart USs objections to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet,

Preliminary Debt Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses
Determination and/or Preliminary Purchase Price Determination, as the case may

Independent Accountants role in completing such review shall be limited to
resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used

Closing Statement and the subsequent objections thereto, which have been made
consistent with the preceding provisions. In resolving such objections, the
Independent Accountants shall apply the provisions of this Agreement
concerning determination of the amounts set forth in the Preliminary Closing
Statement and the decision of the Independent Accountants shall be solely
based on (i) whether such item objected to was prepared in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in this Agreement concerning determination of the 

 



17

    

 amounts set forth therein or (ii) whether the item objected to contains a
mathematical or clerical error. The parties shall not permit the Independent
Accountants to conduct any ex-parte communications with the parties, nor shall
they take into consideration any settlement offers provided or exchanged by
the parties. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, Preliminary Working
Capital Determination, Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Debt
Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses Determination and Preliminary

liable as a result of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are

election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar provisions of U.S.
state, local or non-U.S. law as a result of the purchase of the Shares or that
result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or

 



47

    

 any Acquired Company engaging in any activity or transaction that would
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a
purchase or sale of assets of any Acquired Company for Tax purposes, (C)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Taxes resulting from a
sale of any Acquired Company by Buyer, (D) any Taxes to the extent resulting
from a breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, including any covenant or agreement contained in this _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, and (E) any Taxes described under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)(iv)_ (Taxes
described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E), " _Excluded Taxes_ ").
Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to
any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date, in each instance, less any Taxes on such
refund or credit, except to the extent such refund or credit was included as
an asset in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. Upon the request
of Sellers, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company and its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary, and all actions reasonably
requested by Sellers, to timely claim any refunds to which any Seller is
entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence, including filing (or causing to

each Seller Group Member from and against, (A) any and all Taxes imposed on

the parties agree to elect (and to cause each Acquired Company to elect) to
have each Tax year of each Acquired Company end on the Closing Date and, if
such election is not permitted or required in a jurisdiction with respect to a
specific Tax such that any Acquired Company is required to file a Tax Return
for a Straddle Period, to utilize the following conventions for determining
the amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date: (x) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , if as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the value of any asset is reassessed for
purposes of determining the amount of any property or other Tax, any resulting
increase in Tax for such Straddle Period shall be treated as being solely with
respect to the portion

 



48

    

 of the Straddle Period beginning on the date after the Closing Date; and (y)
in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes,
employment Taxes and withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
as if such Acquired Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such
Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology." For purposes
of applying the foregoing, (A) any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) for income Tax
purposes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period; (B) any Tax or item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from a
transaction occurring on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date; and (C) any
item of deduction attributable to any Transaction Expenses shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other such
Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any real property
transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne by Buyer. With respect
to Taxes described in the preceding sentence, Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in preparing and filing any such Tax Returns
as may be necessary, and the costs of preparing such Tax Returns shall be
borne by Buyer.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Sellers shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired Company on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Sellers or any Affiliate thereof (other
than the Acquired Companies) and (B) all other Tax Returns that are required
to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired Company for taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. In each case, Sellers shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns,
provided such Taxes are indemnified Taxes described in _Section_ __ _
8.1(a)(i)_ for which Chart US is responsible and not Excluded Taxes. Buyer, at
its sole cost and expense, shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired
Company after the Closing Date and Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(ii) All Tax Returns that Buyer is required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ that relate to any taxable year
or period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax
Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, except in each case where
required by applicable Requirements of Law. With respect to any such

 



49

    

 Tax Return to be filed by Buyer, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such due
date is within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide Sellers with a
draft copy of such Tax Return for their approval and Buyer shall incorporate
any reasonable comments made by Sellers in the Tax Return actually filed.

(iii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or
permit any Acquired Company to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to any Acquired Company with respect to
any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with
respect to any Straddle Period), or take any other action (including voluntary
disclosure) that would increase any Tax liability in respect of any taxable
year or period ending on or before the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Sellers.

(c) _Tax Package_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall promptly (but in any
event within ninety (90) days following the Closing) cause each Acquired
Company to prepare and provide to Sellers a package of Tax information
materials, including schedules and work papers (the " _Tax Package_ ")
required by Sellers to enable Sellers to prepare and file all Tax Returns
required to be prepared and filed by Sellers and their respective Affiliates.
The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with past practice,
including past practice as to providing such information and as to the method
of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income
of each Acquired Company, except in each case where required by applicable
Requirements of Law.

 

(d) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers in writing upon receipt by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for which
Chart US may be liable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. 

(ii) Sellers shall have the sole right to represent each Acquired Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to
Taxes for which Chart US may be liable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall have the opportunity to participate in each audit or
proceeding at its own expense. In the case of a Straddle Period, each Seller
shall be entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes
attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and, with the written consent of Buyer, and at such Sellers
sole expense, may assume the entire control of such audit or proceeding.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) may
settle any Tax claim for any Taxes for which Chart US may be liable pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ without the prior written consent of Sellers.

 



50

    

(e) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause their respective

party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 8.1(b)_;

 

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Acquired Company (including any

requested all information, records, and documents relating to Tax Returns of
any Acquired Company;

 

(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments of any Acquired Company for taxable

(vii) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

(f) _Tax Covenants_. With respect to Tax matters, Buyer and Sellers agree as
follows:

 

(i) each U.S. Acquired Companys year-end for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes shall end as of the end of the Closing Date;

(ii) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law,
to treat any Transaction Expenses paid or accrued on or before the Closing as
deductible in taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(or portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) and no party
hereto shall apply the "next day rule" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such deductions; and

 

(iii) to properly make an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct
seventy percent (70%) of any Transaction Expenses that are success-based fees

(g) _Chart US Election_. Chart US shall make an election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) and 1.1502-36(e)(5) with
respect to the US Shares to the extent such election is required to avoid any
attribute reduction for CAIRE (and shall not make an election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B)).

 

(h) _No Section_ __ _ 338 Election_. Buyer and Sellers agree that Buyer shall
not make or cause or permit to be made any election under Section 338 of the
Code or under any applicable similar provision of state or foreign
Requirements of Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.2 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), to take all action
necessary so that each Business Employee shall continue to receive a base wage
rate or salary rate no less than the wage rate or salary rate he or she
is receiving from the respective Acquired Company as of the Closing Date and
bonus opportunities that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to such
Business Employee than the bonus opportunities offered to such Business
Employee by the respective Acquired Company as of the Closing Date.

(b) With respect to the Business Employees of the Acquired Companies other
than Chart China, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no
earlier than the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies other
than Chart china) to provide to each such Business Employee benefits under
Buyers and its Affiliates employee benefit plans and programs (" _Buyer s
Benefit Programs_") that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such
Business Employee as those provided to similarly situated employees of the
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Business Employee
whose employment is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates without cause
(as "cause" is defined by Buyer or its respective Affiliate in its reasonable
discretion) on or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide such Business Employee with
severance payments that are no lower in the aggregate than those severance
payments available to such Business Employee under the Plans in place
immediately prior to the Closing, except to the extent that the Business
Employee is a party to a Contract at the time of termination that
provides for severance payments in the event of such termination, in which
case the Contract severance payments shall be paid in lieu of any other
severance payments.

 

(c) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) to credit Business Employees with all service credited to such
Business Employees as of the Closing Date (or, with respect to the Business
Employees of Chart China, as of the China Transfer Date) in addition to
service earned with Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
after the Closing Date for all purposes (including purposes of eligibility,
vesting and levels of benefits, such as the amount of any vacation, sick days,
severance, layoff and similar benefits) under Buyers Benefit Programs. Buyer
shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to
use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, actively at work 

 



52

    

 requirements or waiting periods for participation and coverage applicable
under Buyers Benefit Programs with respect to Business Employees and their
dependents. Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to use commercially reasonable efforts to credit Business
Employees with any amounts paid under a plan maintained by any Seller or any
of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to the Business
Employees of Chart China, prior to the China Transfer Date) for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance or out-of-pocket
requirements for the plan year that includes the Closing Date (or, with
respect to the Business Employees of Chart China, the China Transfer Date) as
if such amounts had been paid under a corresponding Buyers Benefit Program.

 

(d) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) to honor and recognize immediately after the Closing Date
all vacation time of the Business Employees that is accrued and unused as of
the Closing Date (or, with respect to the Business Employees of Chart China,
as of the China Transfer Date). Nothing in this provision shall limit the
ability or right of Buyer or any Affiliate to modify or eliminate its
vacation policies or plans in its discretion after the Closing Date.

(e) As of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall terminate their
participation in each Plan that is not a Company Plan (except that Chart China
shall terminate such participation as of the China Transfer Date), and in no
event shall any Business Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under
such Plans that are not Company Plans with respect to services rendered or
compensation paid on or after the Closing Date (or the China Transfer Date, as
applicable). For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall retain or assume all
rights and obligations under each Plan that is not a Company Plan, whether
arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

 

(f) As of the Closing Date (or, with respect to the Business Employees of
Chart China, as of the China Transfer Date), all Business Employees shall
cease to contribute to the Chart Industries, Inc. 401(k) Investment and
Savings Plan (the " _Chart 401(k) Plan_ ").

(g) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event not later
than sixty (60) days thereafter), Buyer or its Affiliates shall establish or
designate, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to establish or designate, a
defined contribution plan (the " _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_"). Each U.S. Business
Employee who is eligible to participate in the Chart 401(k) Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date shall become eligible to participate in the
Buyers 401(k) Plan as of immediately after the Closing Date. The Buyers
401(k) Plan shall be qualified as a salary deferral plan under Section 401(k)
of the Code and shall provide the U.S. Business Employees with credit for
service and for all purposes for which such service was recognized under the
Chart 401(k) Plan, including vesting and eligibility to participate, (i) with
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and their
respective predecessors prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) with Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) for all periods on and after
the Closing Date. Effective after the Closing Date, each U.S. Business
Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is a participant in the Chart 401(k)
Plan shall be entitled to a distribution of his or her account balance in
accordance with the terms of the Chart 401(k) Plan as in effect from time to
time and applicable Requirements of Law, and Buyer shall take any and
all action necessary to ensure that the Buyers 401(k) Plan shall accept
"direct rollovers" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
distributions from the Chart 401(k) Plan, if such rollovers are elected by
any Business Employees, including accepting the rollover of any 401(k) loans.

Employee or other current or former employee of any of the Acquired Companies,
including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person not a
party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim hereunder, and
(iii) nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Business
Employee with any Acquired Company for any definite period following the
Closing Date.

(e) Each Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, acknowledges
that a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ may cause the other party
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Each such party therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened

addition to other remedies that it may have, to seek a temporary restraining

55

    

(f) Each Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, acknowledges
that the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are reasonable
and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the other party and
constitute a material inducement to the other party to enter into this

the event that any covenant contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ should ever

Section 8.4 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_, neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall have any right to
make claims after the Closing Date under the Seller Insurance Policies,
whether the incident giving rise to any such claim occurs prior to, on or

sole responsibility of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and such Affiliates.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, from and after the Closing Date,

reasonable time period, (ii) except where Sellers bear indemnification

the Closing Date with respect to any such claims.

 



56

_Section_ __ _ 8.4_, and shall not have any responsibility, and shall not be
held liable, for the actions of the insurers under the Seller Insurance
Policies regarding claims submitted by Sellers or their Affiliates on behalf
of any Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _
8.4_ shall not be construed to limit any rights of Buyer under _Article XI_.

(a) Buyer recognizes that Sellers and certain of their respective Affiliates
or third parties have provided credit support to the Business or the Acquired
Companies pursuant to the Credit Support Obligations set forth on _Schedule

after the date hereof in the ordinary course of the Business and consistent
with past practice.

(b) With respect to such Credit Support Obligations, on or prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to use, and to cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to provide replacement guarantees, letters of
credit, surety bonds, security deposits or other assurances of payment in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and the respective banks or
other counterparties, and Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate to obtain any
release of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) as Sellers may reasonably request in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Sellers with respect to all such Credit Support
Obligations. Seller expressly authorizes Buyer to contact the Persons to whom
the Credit Support Obligations are issued for this purpose following an
introduction (whether by phone, email or otherwise) by the Sellers.

(c) If Buyer is not successful, for any reason, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) from any such Credit Support Obligation
prior to the Closing Date (each such Credit Support Obligation, until such
time as such Credit Support Obligation is released in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_, a " _Continuing Credit Support Obligation_ "), then,
following the Closing:

 

(i) Buyer and Sellers shall continue to use, and shall cause its Affiliates to
continue to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the
complete and unconditional release of Sellers and any of their respective
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) from each Continuing Credit
Support Obligation until such release is obtained; and

 

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their
respective Affiliates from and against any claim, demand or draw upon, or
withdrawal from, any Continuing Credit Support Obligation or any cash or other
collateral or deposit posted by Sellers or such Affiliates in connection with

carrying costs of any cash collateral or deposit not replaced by Buyer or its
Affiliates, the fronting fee costs, and any other out-of-pocket third party
costs and expenses resulting from each such Continuing Credit Support
Obligation.

 



57

    

Section 8.6 _Retained Names and Marks_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees and acknowledges that, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.6(b)_, nothing herein grants Buyer or its Affiliates any rights in any
registered or unregistered Trademarks incorporating the word "Chart" or any of
the words, marks, corporate symbols, acronyms or logos listed on _Schedule
8.6(a)_ or any derivation thereof (collectively the " _Chart Marks_ ").
Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6(b)_, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, use the Chart Marks in connection with the
Business or for any other purpose following the Closing.

(b) Effective as of the Closing and until the six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing (the " _Marks Transition Period_ "), Seller and its Affiliates hereby
grant to Buyer and its Affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license to use the Chart Marks in connection with the Business, including
on websites and materials such as signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales
orders, labels, letterheads, shipping documents, business cards and product
packaging. Prior to the expiration of the Marks Transition Period, Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Companies, as applicable, (i) to make all filings with any
Governmental Body and take all other actions to eliminate the use of any Chart
Marks from their respective corporate names, registered names, fictitious or
doing-business-as names or other similar applications and (ii) to effect the
elimination of any use of the Chart Marks in the Business, including by
removing the Chart Marks from their respective signage, stationary, purchase
orders, invoices, labels, packaging, business cards, equipment, machinery and
advertising materials; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to paper
goods and other similar inventory items, Buyer shall be permitted to allow the
Acquired Companies to use any such amounts of materials existing at the
Closing until they are depleted; _provided further_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Chart China, the Marks
Transition Period shall be deemed to terminate upon the three (3)
month anniversary of the China Transfer rather than the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2_, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall be permitted to communicate to third parties that
they have purchased the Acquired Companies from Sellers and reference such
names in such communications (including with reference to Parent).

Section 8.7 _China Transition Period; China Transfer_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the De-Merger shall not be
completed as of the Closing Date, and therefore, that the China Transfer
shall not be consummated until after the Closing Date. Following the date
hereof, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete the De-
Merger as soon as reasonably practicable (which includes, for the avoidance
of doubt, the expiration of a twelve (12) month holding period of the China
Shares by Chart Asia following the De-Merger Date), and Buyer shall cooperate
reasonably with Sellers with respect thereto. Thereafter, the parties shall
cooperate reasonably to consummate the China Transfer as soon as practicable
following the completion of the De-Merger. 

 



58

    

(b) During the China Transition Period, the parties agree, subject to
applicable Requirements of Law, that the Business in Chart China shall be
held, managed and operated, and that Sellers shall cause the Business in Chart
China to be held, managed and operated, in all respects by Buyer and for
Buyers account, with all gains, income, losses, assets, liabilities, Taxes,
Tax benefits and other items generated solely for Buyers benefit and burden.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the China Transition
Period, Sellers shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts, and shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, to allow Buyer to receive the uninterrupted
control, benefit and burden of the Business in Chart China, (ii) grant to
Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective employees, agents and
representatives, as applicable, the right and license to enter into and occupy
Chart Chinas facility to the same extent, and for the same purposes, as
entered into and used by the Business as of immediately prior to the Closing,
and as is otherwise necessary to allow such Persons to hold, manage and
operate the Business in Chart China pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(b)_,
and (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall cause Chart China not to
take any action set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)(i)_ through _Section_ __ _
7.4(b)(xi)_ without Buyers prior written consent.

 

(c) For the purpose of Section 8.7(b), Sellers shall (i) grant to Buyer the
decision-making rights of all operational affairs of the Business in Chart
China irrevocably during the China Transition Period, (ii) following the De-
Merger Date and the consummation of the relevant business separation, appoint
a new board of directors and legal representative of Chart China with
individuals selected by Buyer (and any changes to such board of directors and
legal representative thereafter shall be made at Buyers sole direction and
expense), and (iii) complete all relevant administrative procedures for the
registration of such board of directors and legal representative at the
applicable time in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.

 

(d) During the China Transition Period, Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the De-Merger Date,
transfer the real property title and ownership of the Chart China facility
from Chart China to Spinco, and thereafter, Chart Asia shall assign the China
Lease Agreement (pursuant to its terms) to Spinco as landlord thereunder.

hereto seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
deliver to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified
Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which shall be
delivered promptly after the Indemnified Party acquires actual knowledge of
the basis for a claim for indemnification hereunder and which shall describe
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim, and shall include
in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount, or the method of computation
of the amount, of such claim and a reference to the provision of this

(b) After the timely delivery of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.3(a)_, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall

65

    

Section 11.4 _Third Person Claims_.

 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided under this Agreement in respect
of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person
against the Indemnified Party, other than an Indemnifiable Proceeding (a "
_Third Person Claim_ "), shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Person Claim within ten (10) Business Days
(or reasonably more promptly dependent upon the circumstances) after receipt
by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Person Claim.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within ten
(10) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Person Claim. Any notice of a claim by reason of
any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement shall refer to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim
is based and describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the facts
giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability
asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the Third Person Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to
give notice to the Indemnitor as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnitor shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) In the event of the initiation of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its
option and at its own expense, to retain counsel, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Proceeding which relates
to any Losses and Expenses indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such Proceeding
with counsel of its choice and at its expense; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or continue
control of the defense of any Third Person Claim if (i) the Third Person Claim
is a criminal Proceeding, (ii) the Third Person Claim seeks, as its primary
purpose, an injunction or equitable relief against any Indemnified Party,
(iii) the potential Losses and Expenses that the Indemnified Party may suffer
as a result of the Third Party Claim is subject to, and (in combination with
all other such Losses and Expenses with respect to which indemnification is
sought) is likely to exceed the Cap, or (iv) the Third Person Claim is
asserted by a customer of any Acquired Company (except if such customer is
also a customer of Sellers or their Affiliates). By assuming control over the
defense, negotiation and settlement of the Third Party Claim, Indemnitor shall
be deemed to have confirmed its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to any Losses and Expenses arising therefrom as
relating thereto. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other
in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Person
Claim at the Indemnitors expense. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such Third Person Claim, or is not entitled to defend such Third
Person Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_, and the Indemnified
Party defends against or otherwise deals therewith, the Indemnified Party may
retain counsel at the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ to pay for only one firm of counsel,
per applicable jurisdiction, for all Indemnified Parties.

 



66

    

(c) Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such
Proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to
perform obligations (including to refrain from taking any actions) or to admit
liability without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnified
Party shall refuse to consent to the settlement of any Third Person Claim, so
long as (i) only money damages are involved (ii), there is no admission of
liability or wrongdoing with respect to the Indemnified Party and (iii) the
Indemnitor agrees that it has indemnification responsibility to all amounts of
such money damages under this Article XI, the liability of the Indemnitor in
respect of such Third Person Claim shall not exceed the amount for which the
Third Person Claim could have been settled plus the amount of expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the time of and in connection with
the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to indemnification.

 

(d) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 

Section 11.5 _Indemnifiable Proceedings_.

 

(a) In the event that any Buyers Group Member receives any notices or
documents (including court papers) relating to any Indemnifiable Proceeding,
Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered copies thereof to Chart US as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the applicable Buyers Group Members receipt thereof).

 

(b) Chart US shall control, defend against, negotiate, settle and otherwise
deal with each Indemnifiable Proceeding at its own expense with counsel
reasonably acceptable to Buyer (and Buyer hereby agrees that each counsel
handling each such Indemnifiable Proceeding as of the date hereof shall be
deemed acceptable). Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate
reasonably with Chart US at Chart USs expense (including Buyers reasonable
attorneys fees, to the extent attorneys are required) in connection with the
defense, negotiation and settlement of any Indemnifiable Proceeding, including
by making witnesses, documents, equipment and products (including parts and
components) which are the subject of any such Indemnifiable Proceeding
available promptly and as reasonably requested, and by preserving relevant
data, documents, equipment and products (including parts and components).

Section 11.6 _Determination of Indemnification Amounts_. 

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitations contained in this
_Article_ __ _ XI_, for purposes of computing the amount of any and all
Losses and Expenses recoverable under this _Article_ __ _ XI_, there shall be
deducted (i) an amount equal to the amount of any Tax Benefit recognized by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses
and Expenses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto in the year in
which such Loss or Expense is incurred, or recognized in the subsequent year,
and (ii) an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or

 



67

    

 reimbursements actually received (net of costs of enforcement, deductibles
and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates in connection with such Losses or Expenses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto (it being understood that the Indemnified
Party and any of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Tax Benefits, proceeds, payments or reimbursements).
The calculation of Losses and Expenses shall not include losses arising
because of a change after the Closing in applicable Requirements of Law or
accounting principles. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any
actual refund or credit of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of
Taxes which otherwise would be owed in the absence of indemnifiable Losses and
Expenses by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, in each
case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient
of such benefit and assuming that such Loss or Expense is the last item to be
recognized during the period incurred.

 

(b) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

(c) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XI_, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such matter.

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 

(e) The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party,
and the _Indemnified_ Partys right to indemnification with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its officers,
directors, employees, consultants, financial advisors, legal counsel,
and accountants) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any
of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such representation
or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified
Partys waiver of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, as the case may be. Chart US (on behalf of
Sellers) shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyers
Group Member pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ to the extent the matter in
question was taken into account in the computation of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.4_.

 

Section 11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing,
except in the case of fraud and except for the equitable remedies expressly
contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 12.14_, its sole and exclusive remedy against
the other party and its respective Affiliates, including for the Losses and
Expenses of any Buyers Group Member or Seller Group Member, as applicable,
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, regardless of whether such claims arise in contract,
tort, breach of warranty or any other legal or equitable theory, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XI_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled.

Section 11.8 _Indemnification Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, Sellers shall have no indemnification responsibility
or other Liability hereunder with respect to any amounts actually received
(net of all Expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer in procuring such recovery)
by CAIRE and its Affiliates under the Indemnification Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall use, and shall cause CAIRE and its Affiliates to
use, reasonable best efforts to fully recover under the Indemnification
Agreement for any Loss indemnifiable thereunder prior to making any
indemnification claim hereunder that would otherwise be the indemnification
responsibility of Sellers under this _Article VII_ ; _provided_ , _further_
, that, promptly following any written request of Buyer, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with any such
indemnifiable matter and make available to Buyer (in each case at Buyers
expense) all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
possession or control of Sellers and their Affiliates related thereto.

 

ARTICLE XII

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

Section 12.1 _Confidential Nature of Information_.

 

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance

Buyer shall not be subject to any restriction with respect to any information
concerning the Acquired Companies, except as set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates and their and their Affiliates respective officers, directors,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, legal counsel, and accountants
(the " _Representatives_ ") to, hold in confidence and not use for any purpose
any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the Acquired
Companies, including the Business, assets, employees, products, customers and
suppliers thereof, except to the extent that such information: (i) is, or
thereafter becomes, generally available to and known (with respect to
information that does not constitute personally identifiable information) by
the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by any Seller,
any of their Affiliates or their Representatives; (ii) is lawfully acquired by
Sellers, any of their Affiliates or their Representatives from and after the
Closing from sources other than the Acquired Companies, which are not known by
such Seller, such Affiliate or such Representative to be prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation;
(iii) is independently developed by any Seller, its Affiliates or their
Representatives without reference to or use of, in whole or in part, any of
the Acquired Companies confidential or proprietary information; (iv) is
reasonably required by any Seller, its Affiliates or their Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any disputes or
actions in connection therewith or arising therefrom; (v) is reasonably

69

    

 statements; (vi) is required to be incorporated into or consolidated with
financial and/or tax information of other businesses of Sellers or their
Affiliates, (vii) is disclosed to any other Person to which such delivery or
disclosure may be necessary or appropriate in connection with any Proceeding
(including pursuant to a written or oral question or request for information
or documents); or (viii) to the extent requested or required by any Seller,
its Affiliates or their Representatives to comply with applicable Requirements
of Law or accounting requirements (including any stock exchange rules). If
Sellers or any of their Affiliates or their Representatives are compelled to
disclose any information, subject to the foregoing clauses (i) through (viii),
by judicial or administrative process or by other Requirements of Law, Sellers
shall, to the extent permitted by Requirements of Law, promptly notify Buyer
in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information which is
legally required to be disclosed, _provided_ , that Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

Section 12.2 _No Public Announcement_. Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor
Sellers, on the other hand, shall, without the prior written approval of the
other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make or cause to be made any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by
applicable Requirements of Law or stock exchange rules, in which case the
other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.

 

Section 12.3 _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made

Section 12.4 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to
this Agreement may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other parties to
this Agreement, except that each party shall be permitted to assign its rights
and delegate its obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of such party;
_provided_ that no such assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder.

Section 12.5 _Access to Records after _ _Closing_.

For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall have reasonable access to all
of the books and records of the Acquired Companies to the extent that such
access may reasonably be required by any such Seller in connection with any
matter relating to or affected by the operations of the Acquired Companies on
or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which Buyer or any
Acquired Company is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.5_;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in any such case, Buyer shall, and
shall cause any applicable Acquired Company to, reasonably cooperate with
Sellers at Sellers expense to seek an appropriate remedy to permit the access
contemplated hereby. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business

 



71

    

 hours; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Seller acknowledges and agrees
that such access shall not interfere unreasonably with the operations of the
Acquired Companies or Buyer. Each Seller shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.5_. If
Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall desire to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of such seven (7)-year period, Buyer
shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at
Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as any Seller
may select.

 

Section 12.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and
supersede all other prior representations, warranties, agreements,
understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the parties hereto
or their respective Affiliates. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the
Schedules) shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written
instrument signed by Buyer and Chart US (on behalf of Sellers).

Section 12.7  _Interpretation_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this
Agreement and the Schedule related thereto so long as the applicability of
such matter to such section or Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.8 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a continuing waiver or
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 



72

    

Section 12.9 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party
hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and independent public accountants.

 

Section 12.10 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a
construction would be unreasonable.

Section 12.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall
become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyer. Delivery of an executed
counterpart by PDF shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

 

Section 12.12 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions as the other party hereto may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Section 12.13 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. No Seller makes any representations
or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or forward-looking
information provided to Buyer. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH SELLER IS SELLING THE APPLICABLE
SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES REPRESENTED
THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND EACH SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND NO SELLER
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Except as
specifically referenced herein or in the Schedules, Buyer acknowledges that
neither Seller nor any of its representatives or Affiliates, nor any other
Person, has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any diligence materials heretofore made
available by any Seller or any of its representatives or Affiliates to Buyer,
and neither Seller nor any of its representatives or Affiliates, nor any other
Person, will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of
Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any such
information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer, any Affiliate of
Buyer or any of their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other
representatives. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to
rely upon any representations or warranties or other statements of fact or
opinion, other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

 



73

    

Section 12.14 _Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement to be performed by Buyer or Sellers are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, prior to
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand (as applicable), shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other parties, as
applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Buyer and Sellers hereby further waive (i) any defense in any
Proceeding for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(ii) any Requirements of Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Section 12.15 _Non-Recourse_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other
documents delivered pursuant hereto, (i) this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any Proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to a breach
of this Agreement by Sellers may only be made against, Sellers, (ii) none of
Sellers Affiliates or Sellers or their Affiliates respective current,
former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders, assignees, or representatives (collectively, the "
_Seller Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability in connection with this
Agreement or any Proceeding in connection therewith (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise), and (iii) Buyer shall have no rights of recovery in respect of
this Agreement against any Seller Related Party, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through any Proceeding
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of any Seller against
any Seller Related Party, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty
or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Requirements of
Law, or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other documents
delivered pursuant hereto, (i) this Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any Proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer may only be made against, Buyer, (ii) none of Buyers
Affiliates or Buyers or its Affiliates respective current, former or future
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members,
stockholders, assignees, or representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer s
Related Parties_") shall have any liability in connection with this Agreement
or any Proceeding in connection therewith (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise), and (iii) no Seller shall have any rights of recovery in respect
of this Agreement against any Buyer Related Party, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through any Proceeding
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of Buyer against any
Buyer Related Party, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Requirements of Law, or
otherwise.

 



74

    

Section 12.16 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal Requirements of Law (without regard to principles of conflicts of
law) of the State of Delaware. By the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Buyer and each of the Sellers submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware in
any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees
to exclusively bring any such suit or proceeding in such forum. EACH OF THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 12.17 _Certain Matters regarding Representation of the_ _Acquired
Companies _ _and_ _Seller_.

(a) The Law Department (" _Chart Legal_ ") of Parent, in concert with
certain outside counsel, including Winston and Strawn LLP (" _Winston_ ", and
collectively with Chart Legal, " _Sellers  Counsel_"), has acted as counsel
for Parent, Sellers and the Acquired Companies (the " _Clients_ ") in
connection with this Agreement, the Buyers Ancillary Agreements, the Seller
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(the " _Pre-Closing Engagements_"), and in that connection not as counsel for
any other Person, including Buyer or its Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be
considered clients of Sellers Counsel in the Pre-Closing Engagements.
Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are or were clients in the Pre-
Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing (and, with respect to Chart
China, upon and after the China Transfer), all communications between any of
the Clients and Sellers Counsel in the course of the Pre-Closing Engagements
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Parent and Sellers and not to any of the Acquired Companies or Buyer, in each
case so long as such communications would be subject to a privilege or
protection if they were being requested in a Proceeding by an unrelated third
party. Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing and the China
Transfer, respectively, the Acquired Companies) shall not have access to any
such communications, or to the files of Sellers Counsel relating to the Pre-
Closing Engagements, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding that the Acquired
Companies are or were clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and after
the Closing (and, with respect to Chart China, upon and after the China
Transfer), except with respect to any communications that would not be subject
to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by
an unrelated third party, (i) Parent and Sellers shall be the sole holders of
the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Pre-Closing Engagements,
and none of the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Sellers Counsel in respect of the Pre-Closing Engagements constitute
property of the Clients (including the Acquired Companies), only Parent and
Sellers shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Sellers Counsel shall have
no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Sellers Counsel and the Acquired Companies or otherwise. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the parties recognize that it would be
impracticable to try to purge all Client-privileged communications from the
Acquired Companies files and computer systems prior to the Closing (or the
China Transfer, as applicable), and so the parties agree that no waiver is
intended by leaving such documents where

 



75

    

 they are and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to review any
such documents, and Buyer agrees that it and its Affiliates shall not be
permitted to use any such documents in a manner adverse to Sellers in any
indemnity or other dispute following the Closing (or the China Transfer, as
applicable).

(b) Upon and after the Closing (and, with respect to Chart China, upon and
after the China Transfer), the Acquired Companies shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Sellers Counsel, unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by Parent, Sellers and the Acquired Companies.
