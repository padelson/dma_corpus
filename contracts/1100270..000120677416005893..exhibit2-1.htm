ARTICLE III 

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_   
 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

 

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company or Merger Sub: 

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each issued and outstanding share of the
Companys common stock (excluding for these purposes any Shares granted in
the form of restricted Shares, which shall be treated pursuant to Section
3.3(b)), no par value (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate (as used in this Agreement, the
term " _Affiliate_ " shall have the meanings provided in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act) of Parent that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the
ultimate parent of Parent and (ii) Shares owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (each of such Shares
described in clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $21.00 (the " _Per Share Merger_ _Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and thereafter any Shares represented by a certificate representing
such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or upon Merger Subs request or otherwise
if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number
of uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry_
_Shares_ ") (in each case, other than Excluded Shares) shall represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any
other Person of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or other Persons performing similar functions is
directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or by one or
more of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding and automatically
be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have under Section 3.2.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, no par
value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, no par
value, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  
 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent
(which shall be a reputable bank or trust company) selected by Parent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in
immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
under Section 3.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
3.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five business days thereafter) the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (or, in the
case of "street-holders," deliver to the Depository Trust Company)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably acceptable
to the parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall solely be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check or wire
(pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal) for any
cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall have the meaning provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act. 

  
 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(f)) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e) below) or Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered to any
Governmental Entity pursuant to and in compliance with applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount and upon such reasonable terms as may be required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check or wire (pursuant to instructions set forth in the letter of
transmittal) in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it reasonably determines in good faith it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or to such Book-Entry Shares. 

  
 

3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At least five days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary action to accelerate the vesting of each
outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans (each, a "
_Company Option_ "), and provide each holder of a Company Option the
opportunity to exercise such Company Option during such five-day period.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, vested or unvested,
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than
fifteen Business Days following the Effective Time, from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such
Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment as provided in Section 3.2(f). In the event that the exercise
price per Share under any Company Option, as adjusted, is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefore and shall have
no further force or effect. 

 

(b) _Treatment of Other Awards Under Stock Plans_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of a right (other than awards of Company Options) entitling
the holder thereof to receive or retain Shares or receive a cash payment
equal to or based on the value of Shares, including any restricted stock
units, issued under the Stock Plans (a " _Share_ _Unit_ ") that is
outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than fifteen Business Days following
the Effective Time, from the Surviving Corporation, a cash payment equal to
the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Share Unit and (y)
the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment as provided in Section 3.2(f);
provided, that the number of Shares subject to each Share Unit that is
subject to performance-based vesting shall be determined based on the level
of achievement of such performance condition through the Closing measured, in
a manner that is consistent with the Companys past practice regarding the
methodology for such measurement, or if greater, the target number of Shares
subject to such Share Unit. At the Effective Time, each holder of a Share
Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
3.3(b).

 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections
3.3(a) and 3.3(b), provided, that the Company shall provide Parent with the
opportunity to review and comment on any such resolutions or actions. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options or otherwise.

  
 

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of issued and outstanding
Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to
Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by
Article III of this Agreement prior to such change;  _provided_ that nothing
in this Section 3.3(a) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV 

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_  

 

Except as (i) set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on its face other than with respect to Section 4.6(a), which shall
not be subject to or qualified by the information set forth in any other

exempt the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby from Section 55-9 and Section 55-9A of the NCBCA, and,
accordingly, neither such section nor any other antitakeover or similar

subject to the various qualifications, assumptions, limitations and other
matters considered in connection with the preparation of such opinion, the
Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of the Shares
(other than Parent, Merger Sub, HoldCo, or any of their respective
Affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders. The Company will provide Parent with a true and
correct copy of such opinion solely for information purposes promptly after

transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for transaction, advisory or
other services unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification or
licensing, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified, licensed

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate or limited liability company action, and no other
corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof
by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

5.3 _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Etc_.

 

(a) No Approval is required to be made with or obtained by Parent or Merger
Sub from any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prohibit the ability
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
or articles of incorporation, or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
assuming that the Approvals referred to in Section 5.3(a) are duly obtained
or made, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a material breach or
violation of any Law to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject, or (iii) with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a
termination, cancellation or modification (or provide a right of termination,
cancellation or modification) or default under, the payment of additional
fees, the creation, change or acceleration of any rights or obligations
under, any requirement to provide notice to, or require consent or approval
from, the other party thereto, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets
of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, pursuant to any agreement, lease,
license, contract, settlement, consent, note, mortgage, indenture,
arrangement or other obligation or understanding binding upon Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for
any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or
change that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to prohibit the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  
 

5.4 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent will have as of the Effective Time, sufficient cash available,
directly or through one or more Affiliates, to pay all amounts to be paid by
Parent in connection with this Agreement, including the payment of (i) the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii) the aggregate payoff amount of
the Wells Fargo Credit Facility as indicated in the pay-off letter referenced
in Section 6.10 and (iii) any fees or expenses in connection with the Merger
or the financing thereof. Parents and Merger Subs obligations hereunder are
not subject to a condition regarding Parents or Merger Subs obtaining of
funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of an executed commitment letter and fee
letter (provided that the fees and the economic terms of the "market flex"
provisions, in each case contained in the fee letter, may be redacted so long
as such redaction does not cover terms that would affect the amount,
availability or termination, or impose any conditionality on the
availability, of any portion of the Debt Financing ) from the financial
institutions identified therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ")
to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ "). " _Financing Sources_ " shall mean the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than Parent) and their respective Affiliates and
their and their respective Affiliates directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives and their respective successors and assigns including the
parties to any joinder agreements to the Debt Commitment Letter or credit
agreements relating thereto.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect, are valid and binding obligations of each of Merger Sub and Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, and are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against each of Merger
Sub and Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto, subject, in each case, as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exceptions. The Debt Commitment Letters have not been amended or
modified, and as of the date hereof, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated (other than to add commercial banks, investment banks or other
institutional investors as lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities with commitments thereunder that have not executed
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof), and the obligations and
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no
such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the date
hereof. Assuming accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article IV, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent,
any other Person, or result in a failure of any condition, under the Debt
Commitment Letters or otherwise result in any of the Debt Financing to be
unavailable at the Closing. There are no side letters or other Contracts or
arrangements (except for any agreements entered into after the date of this
Agreement that are expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters)
relating to the Debt Financing. 

  
 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, Parent is not aware of
the existence of any fact or event that would be expected to cause the
conditions to the Debt Financing to not to be satisfied or the full amount of
the Debt Financing to not be available in full at the Closing. The Debt
Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to Parent and
Merger Sub on the terms therein. 

 

5.5 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets or any officer, director or employee of
Parent or Merger Sub in such capacity before any Governmental Entity, which
would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to prohibit,
prevent, materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
nor any of their respective assets, rights or properties is a party to or
subject to any Judgment of any Governmental Entity which would, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to prohibit, prevent, materially
impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

5.6 _Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or, pursuant to
Section 9.13, an Affiliate of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any
business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the
Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Debt Financing.

 

5.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will,
at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the
time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent and Merger
Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by any other Person which is contained or incorporated by reference
in the Proxy Statement. 

  
 

5.8 _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder
or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders
fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, which brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees would be
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

5.9 _Solvency_. Assuming that the most recent financial statements included
in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by
the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the
consolidated results of operations of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, then at and immediately
following the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the funding of the
Debt Financing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation will be, on a consolidated basis, Solvent. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " shall
mean, when used with respect to a Person, that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person exceeds the amount that will be required to pay such
Persons probable liability on its existing "debts", contingent or otherwise,
as they become absolute and mature, taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be received and to become payable; (b) the assets of such
Person as a "fair valuation" exceeds its "debts" (including contingent
liabilities); (c) to the extent that such Person is the Surviving
Corporation, the excess of the "fair value" of the assets of such Person over
its "liabilities" (including contingent and other liabilities) exceeds such
Persons capital, (d) such Person will not have an unreasonably small amount
of assets or capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or intends to engage, and (e) such Person will be able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature, taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be
received and to become payable. For purposes of this definition, (x) the
quoted terms shall be defined as generally determined in accordance with
applicable Laws governing determination of the insolvency of debtors and (y)
"not have an unreasonably small amount of assets or capital for the operation
of the businesses in which it is engaged or intends to engage" and "able to
pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature" means that such Person will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations (including contingent and other
liabilities) as they become due in the ordinary course.

 

5.10 _Ownership of Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the meeting at which the board of directors of the Company took
the Board Actions, neither Parent nor Merger Sub was the beneficial owner of
"interested shares" as defined in Section 55-9A-01 of the NCBCA.

 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent or Merger Sub
to take, any action that would cause either Parent or Merger Sub to be deemed
a beneficial owner of "interested shares" as defined in Section 55-9A-01 of
the NCBCA.

things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner

Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such
Material Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor HoldCo, on the one hand, nor, except for actions taken in
accordance with Section 6.3, the Company, on the other hand, shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to, or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger or
the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
shall not be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any consent or other
similar fee, or other similar payment or other consideration (including
increased rent or other similar payments) to obtain the consent, waiver or
approval of any Person under any Contract.

 

6.2 _Interim Operations_. 

 

(a) Except as required by applicable Law or as expressly provided by this

material suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors, creditors and
lessors, key employees and independent contractors, and material service
providers, agents and business associates and keep available the services of
its and its Subsidiaries present officers and key employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as set forth on Section 6.2 to the Company
Disclosure Schedules, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be under no
obligation to and shall not, without Parents prior written consent, put
in place any new retention programs or include additional personnel in any
existing retention programs. Without limiting the generality of the
immediately preceding sentence, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, except (A) as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement,
(B) with the prior written consent of Parent or (C) as set forth in Section
6.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company will not and will not
permit its Subsidiaries to: 

 

(i) adopt or propose any change or amendment (whether by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to its articles of incorporation or bylaws or

6.3 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.3, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, nor shall it authorize or permit
their respective Representatives directly or indirectly to:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage, induce or assist any inquiries
or the making, submission, announcement or consummation of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide or furnish any information or data
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than to notify a
Person of the provisions of this Section 6.3), or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Affiliates, designees or Representatives) that could
reasonably be expected to initiate, solicit, encourage, induce or assist the
making, submission or commencement of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement or commitment, or agreement in principle (whether
written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by this Section
6.3);

 

(iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make
an Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Company
has not breached this Section 6.3, the Company may (A) provide information
(which may include non-public information) in response to a request therefor
by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not more favorable
to such other Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and which shall not prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of
this Section 6.3, and prior to or concurrently delivers to Parent any such
information to the extent not previously provided to Parent and (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of the type
described in clause (A) above, if and only to the extent that, prior to
taking any action described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x)
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) based on
the information then available, such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes
a Superior Proposal or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.

  
 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal, indication of interest or
offer relating to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction or series of related
transactions involving the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries (as
such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act
and (ii) any acquisition by any Person of, or proposal or offer, which if
consummated would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of,
directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 10% or
more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the
Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or the acquisition, purchase or
disposition of the business or 15% or more of the consolidated assets
(including equity securities of its Subsidiaries), revenues, net income or
earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of
business, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that would result in any Person (or its shareholders) becoming the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 80% of the assets (on
a consolidated basis) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or more than 80% of
the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into
account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal (including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions, the availability of financing, and any conditions
to consummation relating to financing, regulatory approvals or other
conditions beyond the control of the party having the right to invoke the
condition) and other aspect of the Acquisition Proposal that the board of
directors of the Company deems relevant (i) is more favorable to the
Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided
by Parent pursuant to Section 6.3(c)) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be
consummated.

 

" _Representatives_ " means, with respect to any Person, such
Persons officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other advisors or representatives.

 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation; No Other Agreements_. Neither the board of
directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(B) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, (C) publicly approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Acquisition Proposal or (D) publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing (any action or omission described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or 

  
  

(ii) authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or permit (or
publicly propose to authorize, approve, recommend, declare advisable or
permit) the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or agreement that requires the Company to abandon or terminate this
Agreement, the Merger, or any agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than this Agreement or a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.3(a) entered into in compliance with and subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 6.3(a))(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the Requisite Company Vote, the board of directors of the Company may make
a Change of Recommendation (and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) only if the board of
directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x)
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) if such
action relates to any Acquisition Proposal, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such action
may be made pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) or Section 8.3(b) until 11:59
P.M., New York City Time, on the third business days following Parents
receipt of notice from the Company (as may be extended or renewed pursuant to
this paragraph, the " _Notice Period_ ") advising that management of the
Company currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take
such action and the basis therefor, including (i) in the case of any
Acquisition Proposal all necessary information under Section 6.3(f) (which
notice shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ ,
_further_ that (i) during the Notice Period, the Company shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
(ii) the Company shall negotiate, and shall direct its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith during the
Notice Period (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that obviate the need of the
board of directors of the Company to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b), including in the case of
a Superior Proposal, by such Superior Proposal no longer constituting a
Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, the board of
directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information
provided by Parent and shall have determined (after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that if such changes
were to be given effect that failure to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and, in the case of clause (y) above, any such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) in the
event of modifications to the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of any
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in the first proviso of
this paragraph and a new Notice Period under this paragraph shall commence,
during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.3(c) anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (i) through (iv) of this proviso.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a notice is required under
this Section 6.3(c) (in connection with a termination pursuant to Section
8.3(b)) relates to a Superior Proposal for which the requisite notice or
additional notice has been given pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) (in
connection with a Change of Recommendation), no new or additional notice or
Notice Period will be required for such termination pursuant to Section
8.3(b).

  
 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4 (it
being understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains
only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed to have
the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Recommendation or otherwise deemed to violate the Companys obligations under
this Section 6.3(d)).

 

(e) _Existing Discussions and Agreements_. The Company agrees that it will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that (i) it will promptly
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person or its Representatives by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not release any party from, or terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality or standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the board of
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to do so, the Company
may waive any standstill or similar provisions in such agreements to the
extent necessary to permit a Person to make, on a confidential basis to the
board of directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon
such Person agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent and
Merger Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to compliance with
this Section 6.3 and (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by (x) obtaining
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United
States of America or of any state having jurisdiction and (y) taking all
steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted
to any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) under the
provisions of any such agreement.

  
 

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of
any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto and, in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt, copies of any additional or revised
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the
Companys intentions as previously notified. The Company agrees that it and
its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date hereof that prohibits the Company from providing any information
to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.3(f). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or Section 6.3(a), the Company shall notify
Parent in advance of beginning to provide information to any Person relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or beginning discussions or negotiations with any
Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(g) Any violations of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.3 by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company.

 

6.4 _Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) In accordance with the NCBCA, the articles of incorporation and the
bylaws of the Company, the Exchange Act, and any applicable rules and
regulations of NYSE, the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, duly set a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of shareholders
of the Company (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date upon which the Proxy Statement is cleared by
the SEC (with the record date and meeting date to be set by the board of
directors of the Company after consultation with Parent regarding
such dates). Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the board of directors
of the Company shall recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in
favor of approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement. The
Company shall comply with the NCBCA, the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of NYSE in
connection with the Shareholders Meeting, including preparing and delivering
the Proxy Statement to the Companys shareholders as required pursuant to the
Exchange Act and Section 6.4(b) below. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit (or cause to be solicited) from its shareholders proxies constituting
the Requisite Company Vote. The Company shall not change the date of,
postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting without the consent of Parent;
_provided_ that, without Parents consent, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Shareholders Meeting no more than two times (i) to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the Companys shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Shareholders Meeting, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
from its shareholders proxies in favor of approval of the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement or (iii) if as of the time for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Shareholders Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not
received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote at the Shareholders Meeting; provided that the Stockholders
Meeting shall not be postponed, recessed or adjourned pursuant to this
proviso to a date that is more than thirty days after the date on which the
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written
consent of Parent. Parent may cause the Company to postpone or adjourn the
Shareholders Meeting by prior written notice to the Company once for a period
of no longer than ten business days if Parent believes in good faith that
additional time is required to solicit shareholder proxies in favor of
approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

  
 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement or such later date to which Parent consents (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company, with the
assistance of Parent, shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC,
the preliminary Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and Parent
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement shall reflect the Company
Recommendation and shall include a description of the other Board Actions.
The Company shall also include in the Proxy Statement, and shall obtain all
necessary consents of the Companys financial advisor to permit the Company
to include in the Proxy Statement, in its entirety, the fairness opinion
described in Section 4.3, together with a summary thereof. Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the preliminary Proxy
Statement and the definitive Proxy Statement and shall furnish to the Company
the information relating to it and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation
with Parent, to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC
and to cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the
Companys shareholders at the earliest practicable time. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to
the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly provide
Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff (including any request by the SEC or its staff for any
amendments or supplements to the preliminary Proxy Statement or the
definitive Proxy Statement), and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
filing with the SEC or its staff, and if required, the Company shall mail to
its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or
supplement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any written responses to such SEC comments and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel. The Proxy Statement shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of Law.

Continuing Employee to continued employment by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary thereof to continue any Company Benefit Plan
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit
Plan after the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.17 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee
shall be "at will" employment, subject to the terms and conditions of
employment agreements, severance plans and change of control plans, in each

Parent shall ensure that any such plan shall, for purposes of eligibility,
benefit accrual, vesting and allowances (including paid time off), credit
Continuing Employees for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was
recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding plan;
provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits; provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not apply for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan.

Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries made available
to Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary shall cause there to be
waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and give effect,
in determining any deductibles and maximum out of pocket limitations, to
claims incurred, amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing
Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Plan and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other event, including termination of employment).
Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger
constitutes a change of control or a change in control, as the case may be,
to the extent applicable under any plan, agreement or arrangement set forth
in Section 4.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(f) With respect to the annual bonus for which any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is eligible under any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiarys annual incentive plans with respect to any year, if any, prior

administer each such plan (including the payment of all amounts owed
thereunder at the ordinary time) in accordance with its terms consistent with
past practices in the ordinary course of business.

have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

7.3 _Additional Conditions to the Obligations of the Company_. The obligation
of the Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or

(a) _Accuracy of Representations_. Each of the representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement (disregarding all
qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or a
material adverse effect or any similar standard or qualification), shall be
true and correct, except where the failure of any such representation or
warranty to be so true and correct would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (unless any
such representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which
event such representation or warranty shall be true, complete and correct as
of such specific date).

  
   

(b) _Performance of Covenants_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and HoldCo shall
have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE VIII 

 

 _TERMINATION_  

 

8.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by mutual
written consent of the Company and Parent by action of their respective
boards of directors.

 

8.2 _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time by action of the board of directors of either Parent or the Company if:

 

(a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by November 8, 2016 (such
date, including any permitted extensions thereof, the " _Termination Date_
");

 

(b) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable; or

 

(c) in the event that the Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof, subject to Section 6.4(a)) shall have been held and
been concluded and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained;

 

 _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have primarily contributed to the occurrence of the failure of such
condition to the consummation of the Merger.

 

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company and the Merger may be abandoned:

 

(a) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or HoldCo contained
in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is
incapable of being cured by the Termination Date, or if capable of being
cured by the Termination Date is not so cured; _provided_ , that the
Company shall have given Parent at least 30 days written notice prior to
such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(a); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.3(a) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 

(b) subject to compliance with Section 6.3(c) in order to accept a
Superior Proposal and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement related
to a Superior Proposal, if at such time the Company, prior to or concurrently
with such termination, pays to Parent in immediately available funds the
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(ii).

  
 

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent and
the Merger may be abandoned if:

 

(a) the board of directors of the Company shall have made a Change of
Recommendation or the Company shall have breached any of its obligations
under Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(g) (but only as Section 6.3(g) would be
applied to Section 6.3(a)) in any material respect;

 

(b) at any time following receipt or public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal, the Companys board of directors shall have failed to reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within three business days after receipt of any
reasonable written request to do so from Parent; or

 

(c) prior to the Closing Date, there shall have been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is
incapable of being cured by the Termination Date, or if capable of being
cured by the Termination Date is not so cured; _provided_ , that
Parent shall have given the Company at least 30 days written notice prior to
such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.4(c); _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.4(c) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. 

 

8.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article
VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to
any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives
or Affiliates);  _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge and
agree, in the case of liabilities or damages payable by Parent or Merger Sub,
would include the benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
lost by the holders of the Shares, the Company Options and the Share Units,
which shall be deemed to be damages of the Company) resulting from any fraud
or Willful Breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in
Section 6.9(b) (Financing - Indemnification), Section 6.9(a) (Expenses), this
Section 8.5, Article IX and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Willful Breach_ " shall mean a material breach of, or failure to perform
any of the covenants or other agreements contained in, this Agreement, that
is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-
performing Person with actual knowledge, or knowledge that a Person acting
reasonably under the circumstances should have, that such Persons act or
failure to act would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in or
constitute a breach of or failure of performance under this Agreement.

  
 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and in connection
therewith: 

 

(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed after the date
hereof and not clearly withdrawn in good faith prior to the Termination Date;
and 

 

(B) within 12 months after termination of this Agreement, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this clause (B), the
references to "10%" and "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be a reference to "50%") (any such agreement or consummation, an
" _Acquisition Event_ "), then the Company shall pay to Parent
the Termination Fee within two business days of consummation of such
Acquisition Event;

 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination; or

 

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4 (other than Section 8.4(c)) (any
termination contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a " _Termination Fee
Trigger_ "), 

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within two business
days of such termination. 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean
$42,000,000. No Acquisition Proposal made by a Person shall be deemed to have
been "clearly withdrawn," in the event that the Company later agrees within
the 12-month period specified in Section 8.5(b)(i)(B) to or consummates an
Acquisition Event with such Person or an Affiliate thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (y) the
parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this
Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is paid,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company (and the Companys
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
shareholders and Representatives) shall have no further liability to Parent
and Merger Sub under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of its Willful Breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the aggregate amount of any damages determined by a court to be payable
by the Company pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the
amount of any Termination Fee previously paid to Parent pursuant to this
Section 8.5(b).

  
 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.5(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination
Fee and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a
suit that results in a Judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee
(or a portion thereof), the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate published in the Money
Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. All payments under Section 8.5(b) shall be made
promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the party receiving such payment.

 _MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL_

 

9.1 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except for (i) those covenants
and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time and (ii) this Article
IX.

 

9.2 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by written agreement executed and delivered by each of the parties
hereto at any time before or after the Requisite Company Vote is obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Company Vote has been
obtained, there shall not be made any amendment or modification to this
Agreement that by Law requires the further approval of the shareholders of
the Company without such further approval; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this Section
9.2, Section 9.5(b) and (c), Section 9.8 and Section 9.14(b) (and any
related definitions to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of
such definitions would modify the substance of any of the foregoing
provisions) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is
adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (not including
Parent or Merger Sub), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 

 

9.3 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure or
delay of any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights or remedies.

  
 

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of
which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to the other parties.

 

9.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MERGER AND THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF
SHARES, COMPANY OPTIONS AND SHARE UNITS (TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA TO BE GOVERNED THEREBY), AND MATTERS RELATING
TO THE CONDUCT OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES (WHETHER
THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in the Southern District of New York in the State
of New York solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such
document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a New York state or federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim,
or third-party claim of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, Borough of Manhattan or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

  
 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN
CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

 

(d) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by any party in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such
party. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the non-breaching parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other party and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement against the other party, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection therewith. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, each party hereby agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy
at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity.

 

9.6 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the letter agreement, dated April 8, 2016,
between JAB Beech Inc. (an Affiliate of Parent) and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT, MERGER SUB NOR THE
COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS
TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE
AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY
OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

 

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.12
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and in Section 6.9(b)
(Financing - Indemnification), Parent and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party beneficiaries of
Section 9.2, Section 9.5, this Section 9.8 and Section 9.14. The parties
hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
Section 6.12 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs but
that the rights of the third party beneficiaries under Section 6.9(b) can be
enforced prior to the Effective Time and after the termination of this
Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

  
 

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires Merger Sub or another Affiliate of Parent to take any action, Parent
shall be liable for any failure of such Person to take such action. Whenever
this Agreement requires any Subsidiary of the Company to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

 

9.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 

9.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid,
void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 

9.12 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section of, Annex to or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this Agreement shall refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall also include the plural and
vice versa. A reference in this Agreement to $ or dollars is to U.S. dollars.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  
 

9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another of its Affiliates to be a Constituent
Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Affiliate, except that
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other Affiliate as of the date of such designation
and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their respective
rights and obligations hereunder to a lender as collateral, in each case
after providing written notice thereof to the Company prior to such
designation or assignment; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such designation
or assignment shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede
the rights of the shareholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 

9.14 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of
any party hereto or of any of their respective Affiliates (unless such
Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement) shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of such
party arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 9.14 shall limit any liability of the parties to this Agreement for
breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that none of the
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing). The Company
and its Affiliates hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (including the Debt Financing). This Section 9.14(b) is intended
to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Company. 

  
 

9.15 _HoldCo Obligation_. HoldCo hereby agrees to cause Parent to perform its
payment obligations under this Agreement, and to be held liable for any
breach by Parent of such obligations as though it were Parent. HoldCo hereby
represents and warrants that (i) the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action and do not contravene any provision of HoldCos governing
documents or any Law or contractual restriction binding on HoldCo or its
assets, (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of HoldCo enforceable against HoldCo in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions, and (iii) HoldCo has currently, and
will have on the Closing Date, the financial capacity (which, other than on
the Closing Date, may include access to available borrowings or liquid
assets) to pay and perform the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and HoldCo
under this Agreement, and all funds necessary for HoldCo to fulfill
the obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and HoldCo shall be available to
HoldCo. 

  
 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first
written above.
