---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTo the extent that any Assumed Contract or Permit is not
capable of being assigned, transferred or conveyed without the consent, waiver
or authorization of a third person (including a governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority), or if such assignment, transfer or conveyance or
attempted assignment, transfer or conveyance would constitute a breach of any
Assumed Contract or Permit, or a violation of any law, statute, decree, rule,

assignment, transfer or conveyance of such interest, or an attempted
assignment, transfer or conveyance of such interest (such interests being
hereinafter collectively referred to as "Restricted Interests"). The entire
beneficial interest in any Assumed Contract or Permit subject to the
restriction as described above, and any other  \t\t

provision of this Agreement or any agreement, instrument or document
contemplated hereby (the "Transaction Documents"), such failure or inability
shall not constitute a breach or misrepresentation under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTo the extent that the consents, waivers and
authorizations referred to in Section 1.5(a) hereof are not obtained by the

deemed accepted by the Sellers, unless within thirty (30) days after the
Sellers' receipt thereof (the "Objection Period"), Sellers provide the Buyer
with written notice of objection with respect to the Net Working Capital
Documents (a "Notice of Objection"). The Notice of Objection shall specify in

Objection is received by the Buyer, the Buyer and the Sellers shall meet in an

Seller are unable to resolve the dispute within such fifteen (15) day period,
then any disputed matter set forth in the Notice of Objection that remains
unresolved shall be submitted for final determination to Deloitte or such
other independent accounting firm of national repute agreed to by the Parties
(the "Independent Accounting Firm"). The Independent Accounting Firm shall,
based solely on the documents and presentations made by the Buyer and the
Seller and within thirty (30) days after the disputed matters are submitted to
it, render a written report as to the resolution of each disputed matter set
forth in the Notice of Objection that remains unresolved, and as to the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital. The Independent Accounting Firm shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be the sole
recourse and remedy of the parties against one another or any other Person
with respect to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties and shall be enforceable in a court of law. The
Independent Accounting Firm's fees and expenses shall be borne equally by the
Buyer and the Seller.

resolution of any disputed matters by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant
to Section 2.3(c)(ii).

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tPost-Closing Payment. Promptly (but not later than five
(5) Business Days) after the final and binding determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital as set forth in Section 2.3(c)(iii): 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tif Closing Net Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital and the Seller shall pay by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Buyer such amount. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tif Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Buyer shall pay by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Seller such amount.

 \t\t\t\t 2.4 \t\t\tProrations. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tContractual Payments and Collections. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tall fees, rent, water, gas, electricity and other
utilities; local business or other license fees, to the extent assigned, and
other charges payable with respect to the Purchased Assets, including
contractual payment obligations under the Assumed Contracts (collectively, the
"Payables") shall be prorated between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, effective as of the Effective Time with Sellers being
responsible for all Payables related to the period prior to but excluding the
Closing Date and Buyer being responsible for all Payables related to the
period on and after the Closing Date. At Closing, the Net Working Capital
shall be (A) increased by the pro-rated amount of all such Payables made by
Sellers prior to Closing that are attributable to Buyer's period of ownership
of the Purchased Assets, and (B) decreased by an amount equal to the pro-rated
amount of any such payment obligations assumed by Buyer that are attributable
to Sellers' period of ownership of the Purchased Assets. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause utility meter readings to be
determined as of the Effective Time or as close thereto as reasonably
practicable; provided, however, that if a party's proration for a particular
amount owed under this Section 2.4(a)(i) cannot be determined due to the
unavailability of the necessary information on the appropriate invoice or
remittance statement, then the proration shall be calculated on a per day
basis using the number of days in the respective party's period of ownership
of the Purchased Assets. In determining whether a payment to a third party
pursuant to any Assumed Contract is attributable to Buyer's period of
ownership or the Sellers' period of ownership, the parties will allocate the
burden of such payment in a manner that reflects the relative benefit of such
work performed, services provided or goods delivered to each party; provided,
however, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any work performed,
services provided or goods delivered prior to the Closing Date are for the
benefit of Sellers, and any work performed, services  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t9  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

provided or goods delivered on or after the Closing Date are for the benefit
of Buyer. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIf Buyer receives any funds or other property that
belongs to any Seller, or vice versa, then the receiving party shall hold such
funds and property in trust for the benefit of the rightful party and shall
promptly forward such funds or property to the rightful party. It is the
intention of the parties that Sellers shall receive all income, rentals, fees
and other revenues (including any under Assumed Contracts) attributable to
Sellers' period of ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets, and Buyer
shall receive all income, rentals, fees and other revenues (including any
under Assumed Contracts) attributable to Buyer's period of ownership and
operation of the Purchased Assets. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 2.5 \t\t\tPurchase Price Allocation. As promptly as practicable,
but not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall
exchange their respective schedules allocating the Purchase Price (plus
Assumed Liabilities, to the extent taken into account under Section 1060 of
the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (as to each of Buyer and the Sellers, the "Allocation"). Buyer and
Sellers will make reasonable efforts to agree their respective Allocations for
purposes of the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including the
filing for Form 8594); provided, however, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Buyer and Sellers to agree to a common Allocation. The Bluffton
Allocation, the Lakota Allocation and the Riga Allocation is set forth on
Schedule 2.5.

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSchedule 4.8 sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all Plant Specific Intellectual Property. To the Sellers' Knowledge, Sellers
own or have a defensible right to use all Plant Specific Intellectual Property
described in Schedule 4.8, but Buyer acknowledges that Sellers' defensible
right to use certain Intellectual Property and know-how material other than
the Plant Specific Intellectual Property to conduct the Business as it is
currently conducted by Sellers is based in part upon licenses granted to
Sellers set forth in the Excluded Contracts listed in Schedule 1.2(c), which
licenses are not transferred as part of this Agreement, and Sellers make no
representation or warranty that Buyer can use any Intellectual Property other
than the Plant Specific Intellectual Property without the licenses granted to
Sellers set forth in the Excluded Contracts listed in Schedule 1.2(c). To the
Sellers' Knowledge, and except for claims received by the Sellers that
resulted in licenses referenced in the Excluded Contracts set forth in
Schedule 1.2(c), Sellers have not received written notice that their right to
use the know-how and trade secrets material to the conduct of the Business as
it is currently conducted is not valid. To the  \t\t

 \t\t

Sellers' Knowledge, no use or possession by the Sellers of any Plant Specific
Intellectual Property has infringed or does infringe on the rights of any
party. The Plant Specific Intellectual Property used by the Sellers, along
with the intellectual property licensed to Seller in the Excluded Contracts
set forth in Schedule 1.2(c), is sufficient Intellectual Property for the
operation of the Business as it is currently conducted. To the extent Sellers
use Plant Specific Intellectual Property licensed from a third party in the
operation of the Business as it is currently conducted, Sellers have used
reasonable, good faith efforts, which efforts may include, but are not limited
to, seeking warranties of ownership or the right to license or provide such
Plant Specific Intellectual Property, or an indemnification by such third
party against infringement arising from the possession or use of such licensed
Plant Specific Intellectual Property by Sellers, to obtain verification that
the party providing or licensing such Plant Specific Intellectual Property has
the right to so provide or license such Plant Specific Intellectual Property.
The Sellers comply in all material respects with the terms, conditions and
obligations contained in any contracts or licenses conveying or granting the
Sellers rights to use, modify, sell or license Plant Specific Intellectual
Property. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no actions by any third party infringe
upon any of the Seller-owned Plant Specific Intellectual Property described in
Schedule 1.1(g).

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tall applicable fees, royalties and payments relating to
the Plant Specific Intellectual Property due and payable by Sellers or their
Affiliates to any licensors of such Plant Specific Intellectual Property have
been paid, except for such fees, royalties and payments as could not
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Sellers' rights
therein or the ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tSchedule 4.8 sets forth a complete and accurate list and
summary description of all Net Names registered with a domain name registrar.

dispute, opposition, invalidation or cancellation proceeding and no such
action is threatened with respect to any Net Name.

is currently conducted.

that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal income
Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and, to

cause the revocation of such determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service or the unavailability of reliance on such opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, as applicable. With respect to any Benefit Plan, to
Sellers' Knowledge, no event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that has resulted in or would subject Seller to a Tax under Section 4971 of
the Code or the Purchased Assets to a lien under Section 430(k) of the Code.

 \t\t\t\t 6.14 \t\t\tRail Cars. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSellers agree to transfer or cause their respective
Affiliates to transfer to Buyer up to the number and types of railcars listed
in Schedule 6.14(a). These railcars are leased by Sellers and/or their
Affiliates pursuant to various railcar leases and agreements with respect
thereto ("Rail Car Agreements"). Sellers have provided to Buyer copies of the
applicable Rail Car Agreements, along with the lease rates and other fees that
the counterparty of each Rail Car Agreement is currently charging Sellers or
their applicable Affiliates for the railcars that are the subject of the Rail
Car Agreements (the "Lease Rates"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tBeginning promptly after Closing, Sellers will
coordinate with Buyer to schedule railcars from Sellers' or their Affiliates'
fleet into the Ethanol Plants as needed in the  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

ordinary course of business, and as such cars come into the Ethanol Plants
they will be identified by Buyer as railcars to be assigned or subleased to
Buyer ("Qualifying Rail Cars"), until such time as all Qualifying Rail Cars
have been identified. Only railcars that are in serviceable condition when
they arrive at the Ethanol Plants will be used as Qualifying Rail Cars.
Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate terms of an inspection program for the
Qualifying Rail Cars such that a baseline condition for each car is
documented and Buyer is not liable for any damage or mechanical failure
conditions that existed prior to Closing. As Qualifying Rail Cars are
identified, Sellers or their appropriate Affiliates and Buyer shall deliver to
the counterparty of each Rail Car Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars
a letter: (i) requesting the assignment of the Rail Car Agreement covering
such Qualifying Rail Cars from Sellers or their respective Affiliate to Buyer,
or (ii) requesting the release of such Qualifying Rail Cars under the
applicable Rail Car Agreement, and the further lease by such counterparty to
Buyer of such Qualifying Rail Cars. Once a Qualifying Rail Car becomes fully
assigned to the Buyer, it will become a "Buyer Rail Car". Should the
counterparty of any Rail Car Agreement refuse to consent to the assignment of
Qualifying Railcars to Buyer, Sellers will use reasonable efforts to provide
substitute Qualifying Rail Cars. In no event shall Buyer or Sellers be
obligated to include Rail Cars for which the counterparty to the Rail Car
Agreement seeks to modify the original terms so as to negatively impact either
party. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTo account for any difference between fair market rates
and Lease Rates Sellers and Buyer agree to true-up (as part of the Net Working
Capital adjustment in Section 2.3) the difference between (i) sum of the
present values of the product of the monthly Lease Rate multiplied by the
number of railcars that are Qualifying Rail Cars for each month remaining on
the term of the Rail Car Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars (the
"Lease Charge"); and (ii) the sum of present values of the product of the
applicable fair market rate listed on Schedule 6.14(c) for similarly situated
railcars (the "Market Rates") multiplied by the number of railcars that are
Qualifying Rail Cars for each month remaining on the term of the Rail Car
Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars (the "Market Charge"). If the
Lease Charge is less than the Market Charge, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount of the difference between the Lease Charge and the Market Charge as
part of the Working Capital adjustment in Section 2.3(d) hereof. If the Lease
Charge is greater than the Market Charge, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount
of the difference between the Lease Charge and the Market Charge as part of
the Working Capital adjustment in Section 2.3(d) hereof. The annual discount
rate to be used in determining the present value factor for the Market Charge
and Lease Charge shall be equal to seven percent (7%). The discount period
for each monthly calculation will be from the middle of each month to the
Closing Date.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tAs it relates to hopper railcars, Sellers acknowledge
that damages have occurred prior to Closing, and such damages must be repaired
upon termination of the Rail Car Agreements applicable to such hopper
railcars. The estimated repair cost (on a per car basis) for each of the
hopper railcars that are to become Buyer Rail Cars is set forth on Schedule
6.14(d) (the "Estimated Damage Amount"). To the extent that a hopper railcar
becomes a Buyer Rail Car, Seller shall pay to Buyer as part of the Net Working
Capital adjustment the Estimated Damage Amount related to that damaged hopper
railcar. Sellers and Buyer shall also apply an annual discount rate equal to
seven percent (7%) to be used in determining the present value factor for the
Estimated Damage Amount, with such present value period for the Estimated
Damage Amount transpiring from the expiration date of the applicable Rail Car
Agreement to the Closing Date.

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tUntil such time as the parties complete the paperwork
and secure the necessary counterparty consents to complete the assignment of
the Qualifying Rail Cars to the Buyer, Sellers shall, or shall cause their
Affiliates to, allow Buyer to use the Qualifying Rail Cars on a temporary
subleased basis (the "Loaned Cars") such that, at any time, the total number
and types of Buyer Rail Cars and Loaned Cars equals the number and types
identified as Qualifying Rail Cars. Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for all
lease payments and other associated costs, payments or fees (including repair
and maintenance costs) arising under the applicable Rail Car Agreements with
respect to the use by Buyer of the related Loaned Cars. Buyer may elect to
discontinue the use of any Loaned Car by written notice to Sellers, in which
case, upon return of such Loaned Car to Sellers, Buyer shall no longer be
responsible for any payments, costs or fees related thereto, and Sellers shall
not be responsible for providing a replacement Loaned Car. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that Sellers may substitute other equivalent railcars for Loaned
Cars, so long as the substituted railcars meet the criteria to be Qualifying
Rail Cars. The parties hereto agree to (or to cause their applicable
Affiliates to) work together in a commercially reasonable manner to manage the
transition of the Loaned Cars hereunder. Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in
good faith a sublease agreement that would further define terms of the Loaned
Cars. Such sublease agreement may also account for the temporary use by Buyer
of additional railcars that are not Qualifying Rail Cars. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Sellers' sole obligations under this Agreement with respect to
Required Consents necessary for the assignment to Buyer of the Qualifying Rail
Cars shall be the delivery by Sellers to the counterparties thereto of the
letters described in Section 6.14(c) above and Sellers' joinder in the
execution of any documentation reasonably and customarily required by the
counterparties to effectuate or otherwise document such assignments. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Sellers shall not be required
to provide any guarantees or other credit enhancement that may be necessary in
order for Buyer to secure the necessary consent for the assignment of the Rail
Car Agreements or for Buyer to secure its own railcar leases. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperatively endeavor to complete the assignment of all
Qualifying Rail Cars (including any substitutes therefor made in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.14(b) as promptly as reasonably possible
after Closing, but in all events within three (3) months after Closing.
Sellers shall not be obligated to provide any Loaned Cars more than six (6)
months following Closing, unless and only to the extent that Buyers' failure
to complete the assignment of all Qualifying Railcars (and substitutes
therefor, as applicable) is the result of Sellers' failure to comply with its
obligations under this Section 6.14.

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tBuyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees against any and all Losses arising from the use or misuse
after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates of the Loaned Cars pursuant to
this Section 6.14.

 \t\t\t\t 7.2 \t\t\tNotification of Changes. The Buyer will promptly advise
the Sellers in writing of (i) any event occurring or not occurring subsequent
to the date of this Agreement but before the Closing Date that is reasonably
likely to (a) render any representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in
Article V of this Agreement untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or
(b) cause any covenant, condition or agreement of the Buyer contained in this
Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects and
(ii) any notice or other communication from any Third Party alleging that the

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

assets and property of the Buyer (excluding information and communications
which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements or the attorney-
client privilege or work product doctrine) as may be required by the Sellers
to file any additional information requested by the FTC or the Antitrust

Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer
agrees to provide to the Sellers copies of all correspondence between it (or

matters described in this Section 7.4(b); provided that such correspondence
does not contain or reveal confidential information of the Buyer. The Buyer
agrees that, except as the Sellers may otherwise agree, all telephonic calls
and meetings with such agencies regarding the transactions contemplated hereby
or any of the matters described in this Section 7.4 shall include
representatives of the Sellers, provided that Buyer may participate in a non-
material, non-substantive communication initiated by a Governmental Authority
and promptly notify the other party of such communication.

this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to place any restrictions on
Buyer's or Buyer's Affiliates pre-existing or future business or assets, and
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will be required to dispose of any of

and hold harmless Sellers in accordance with and subject to the limitations in
Article 10 from any and all Losses relating to, resulting from, or arising out

 \t\t\t\t 8.3 \t\t\tTitle Matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tTitle Commitment and Survey. Sellers shall (i) cause
the Title Company to issue, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this
Agreement, commitments (the "Title Commitments") for one or more Title
Policies to be issued by the Title Company with respect to each parcel of Real
Estate together with copies of all instruments identified therein as creating
exceptions or title defects (the "Exceptions") and (ii) have prior the
Effective Date delivered to Buyer copies of all existing surveys, plats and
site plans of the Real Estate in Seller's possession (the "Existing Surveys").
Buyer shall have the right to within thirty (30) days following the Effective
Date, at its sole cost and expense, to cause the Existing Surveys to be
updated or obtain a new survey or surveys of the Real Estate (the "Updated
Survey" and together with the Existing Surveys, the "Survey"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t31  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tTitle Review. Buyer shall have the right to make
objections ("Title Objections") to any Exception or any reservation, easement,
covenant, exception, limitation, restriction or other defect shown on the
Updated Survey or reflected in the Title Commitment, such Title Objections to
be made in writing and delivered to Sellers, the Title Company and Surveyor
within ten (10) days following the latter of Buyer's receipt of the Title
Commitments, the documents reflecting Exceptions, or the Updated Survey.
Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure (or cause to be
cured, including by way of express title insurance or its equivalent) any
Exceptions constituting Title Objections, such cure to be effected not later
than 5 Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Cure Period"); provided,
however, that in the event a mortgage, deed of trust or other similar monetary
lien secured by the Real Estate and placed on the Real Estate by or at the
request of a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller (collectively a "Mortgage
Lien") affects all or any portion of the Sellers' interest in the Real Estate,
on or before Closing, Sellers shall cause all such Mortgage Liens to be
satisfied in a manner which is sufficient to cause them to no longer affect
title to the Real Estate, and the Real Estate shall be conveyed free and clear
of all such Mortgage Liens, and such Mortgage Liens shall in no event
constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a Permitted Lien. If Sellers elect
not to, fail, or are unable for any other reason to cure any Exceptions
constituting Title Objections during the Cure Period, Buyer shall have the
right, within five (5) days following the expiration of the Cure Period and as
Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy in such event, to either (i) waive in
writing its Title Objections with respect to such Exceptions, or (ii)
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Sellers, it being understood
that the scheduled Closing Date shall be extended by five (5) days (or the
lesser number of days until Buyer waives the Title Objections, if applicable)
to accommodate Buyer's election. If Buyer fails to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence within
the required time period or otherwise consummates the Closing, then Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived all Title Objections which have not, as of such
time, been cured, and all Exceptions forming the basis for such uncured Title
Objections shall become Permitted Liens. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tEach Title Policy shall insure good and marketable fee
simple title to the Real Property for an amount determined by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion (subject to any limitations imposed on the Title Company
by applicable Law and underwriting requirements) but subject to Permitted
Liens, the Exceptions and the standard printed exceptions in the promulgated
Title Policy form. Provided that Sellers and their Affiliates will not
thereby incur any Liabilities that are not otherwise expressly set forth in
the other provisions of this Agreement, Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in executing any documents reasonably requested by the Title
Company which may be necessary to issue the Title Policies, including
providing any factually true affidavit reasonably requested by the Title
Company or Buyer to evidence the payment or satisfaction of any Liens, to
evidence the payment of any Taxes affecting the Real Property, or to evidence
the satisfaction of any other matter which Buyer may be required to establish
in order to obtain the Title Policy or any endorsement thereto. The cost and
expense of procuring and issuing the Title Commitments and the Title Policy
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

 \t\t\t\t 8.4 \t\t\tTax Matters. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tSales and Use Taxes. Sellers and Buyer agree that all
state and local sales and use Taxes relating to the sale and conveyance of the
Purchased Assets shall be the Liability of Buyer, and shall be borne by Buyer
as follows: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t32  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAt Closing, Sellers shall not collect from Buyer any
state and local sales and use Taxes. Rather, Buyer shall remit such Taxes
directly to the appropriate Governmental Authorities when such Taxes are due
and owing and Buyer shall provide proof of payment to Sellers. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tPromptly following Closing, Buyer shall provide each
Seller with an appropriate exemption certificate to establish the right to any
exemption from state and local sales and use Taxes and for any exemptions from
any other applicable state Tax. Buyer shall thereafter provide each Seller
with any additional exemption certificates and other documentation as may be
required by the Governmental Authorities for such purpose. Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer, including providing Buyer with reasonable
access to Sellers' books, records and such other data as Buyer may reasonably
request in order to support all applicable sales Tax exemptions, subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tIf any exemption claimed by Buyer is subsequently
denied by any Governmental Authority, and as a result a Seller is assessed
additional Taxes, then Buyer shall remit such Taxes directly to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, or, in the event such Taxes are remitted
by Sellers, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers, or their assignees, for such
assessed Taxes, including interest and penalty. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tProperty Taxes. All real property, personal property,
ad valorem and other similar Taxes assessed on any of the Purchased Assets
("Property Taxes") in the Tax Period in which the Closing Date occurs shall be
prorated between Buyer and Sellers based on the number of days of such Tax
Period before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the number
of days in such Tax Period on and after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing
Tax Period"). Sellers shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such
prorated Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer
shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such prorated Taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. At Closing, the Purchase Price
shall be (i) increased by the amount, if any, of any such Taxes prepaid by
Sellers with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) decreased by the
amount, if any, of any such Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period which
Buyer will be obligated to pay after Closing. If the Closing Date shall occur
before the tax rate or assessment is fixed for such Tax year, the
apportionment of such Taxes and payments at the Closing shall be based upon
the most recently ascertainable tax bills, with an adjustment being made
between Sellers and Buyer when such Taxes and the assessed valuation for the
Tax year in which the Closing occurs are known. Buyers shall file all
required reports and returns incidental to such Taxes that become due and
payable after Closing and shall pay such Taxes on or before the due date
therefor. To the extent that the amount of any such Taxes paid by Buyers with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds the Purchase Price adjustment
therefor, Sellers shall reimburse Buyers for the difference within thirty (30)
days of Seller's receipt of Buyers' invoice therefor, accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation (including copies of relevant Tax bills).
Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
any property Tax assessment or valuation (or protest in connection therewith)
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Tax periods in which the
Closing Date occurs. If either party hereto receives a refund of any property
Taxes for which the other is liable or responsible under this Agreement, the
party receiving such refund, whether received in cash, or as  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t33  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

a credit against another state and/or local Tax, shall, within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of such refund, remit it to the party who is liable. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tTax Returns. Except as provided otherwise in this
Agreement: (i) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of a Straddle
Period that ends on the day before the Closing Date, each Seller shall be
responsible for timely filing of all Tax Returns required by applicable Law to
be filed, and payment of all Taxes due, levied or imposed, in connection with
the Purchased Assets, the Business, or Employees and independent contractors
engaged in operating or maintaining the Purchased Assets or marketing products
produced at Ethanol Plants; (ii) for any Post-Closing Tax Period or to the
portion of a Straddle Period that arises on or after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be responsible for the timely filing of all Tax Returns required by
applicable Law to be filed, and payment of all such Taxes levied or imposed,
in connection with the Purchased Assets, the Business, or employees and
independent contractors engaged in operating or maintaining the Purchased
Assets or marketing products produced at Ethanol Plants; and (iii) control of
any legal or administrative proceedings concerning any such Taxes with respect
to the Purchased Assets shall rest with the party responsible for payment
therefor under this Section 8.4(c).

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tRefund and Tax Benefits. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tAny Tax refunds related to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities that are received by Buyer, and any amount credited
against Taxes to which Buyer become entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Period or to the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on the day before the
Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to
Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tAny Tax refunds related to the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities that are received by Seller, and any amount credited
against Taxes to which Sellers become entitled, that relate to any Post-
Closing Tax Period or to the portion of a Straddle Period that arises on or
after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer, and Sellers shall
pay over to Buyer any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tCooperation. With respect to any Taxes related to the
Purchased Assets, Buyer and Sellers agree (i) to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as applicable, such
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the computation of
any such Taxes or the filing of any applicable Tax Return, the making of any
election, or the preparation for or conduct of any audit, examination, or
other proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (ii) to furnish each other
with copies of any notices from any Governmental Authority that might affect
the liability of the other party for Taxes, (iii) to cooperate with each other
in the conduct of any audit, examination, or other proceeding, and (iv) that
no compromise or settlement of any item from a Tax audit or proceeding which
potentially affects the other party shall be agreed upon without prior written
consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tTax Treatment. Buyer and Sellers agree, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, to treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as a purchase of the assets of the Sellers by Buyer and will take no actions
inconsistent with such treatment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Sellers shall be responsible for Taxes on any gain resulting
from the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyer hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t 8.5 \t\t\tCasualty or Condemnation. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tNotice. In the event that, prior to the Closing Date,
all or any portion of the Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed in whole
or in part (the portion of the Purchased Assets so damaged or destroyed, the
"Damaged Portion"), whether by fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, explosion
or other casualty (a "Casualty") or taken by condemnation or eminent domain or
by agreement in lieu thereof with any Person or Governmental Authority
authorized to exercise such rights (a "Taking"), Sellers shall notify Buyer
promptly in writing (a "Casualty Notice") of the Casualty or Taking. The
Casualty Notice shall include: (i) a reasonable description of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the Casualty or Taking; (ii) Sellers' preliminary
assessment of the effect of the Casualty or Taking on the Purchased Assets;
and (iii) Sellers' preliminary assessment of whether, and the extent to which,
any losses sustained as a result of such Casualty or Taking are covered by one
or more insurance policies (including property/casualty and workers'
compensation policies) maintained immediately prior to the Closing by the
Seller 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tRepair or Replacement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (i) \t\t\tIn the event of a Casualty or Taking between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, Sellers shall elect, at their option, to
either (A) repair or replace or make adequate provision for the repair or
replacement of the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets at Sellers' cost
prior to the Closing, in which case Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing
shall not be affected, but the Closing Date (and the End Date, if necessary)
shall be deferred until three (3) Business Days after repairs or replacement
have been completed and the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets is fully
repaired or restored to the condition thereof immediately prior to such
Casualty or Taking in accordance with applicable Laws or Orders, or (B)
negotiate with Buyer to reduce the Purchase Price to reflect the cost to
repair or replace the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets and the post-
Closing loss of net income associated with such business interruption (such
repair or replacement costs and loss of net income, the "Repair Costs").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller's election in clause (A) of this Section
8.5(b)(i) shall be unavailable and clause (B) of this Section 8.5(b)(i) shall
apply if the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets cannot reasonably be
expected to be fully repaired or restored to the condition thereof immediately
prior to such Casualty or Taking in accordance with applicable Laws or Orders
on or before the date that is 180 days following the occurrence of the
Casualty or Taking (the "Casualty Event Termination Date") 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ii) \t\t\tIf the applicable Seller and Buyer agree on the Repair
Costs within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of Sellers' notice of the
Casualty or Taking (the "Repair Negotiation Period"), Buyer's obligation to
effect the Closing shall not be affected, but the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Repair Costs so agreed.

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t35  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iii) \t\t\tIf the applicable Seller and Buyer do not agree on the
Repair Costs within the Repair Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"),
Buyer or the applicable Seller may request an engineering company (and/or
other appropriate specialist) that shall be mutually agreed to by Buyer and
the applicable Seller to evaluate the Damaged Portion of the Purchased Assets
and the loss of net income associated with such business interruption and
deliver to Buyer and the applicable Seller its written estimate of the Repair
Costs (the "Third-Party Estimate") within fifteen (15) days after the end of
the Repair Negotiation Period. If the Third-Party Estimate is less than the
Buyer Casualty Threshold (or greater than the Buyer Casualty Threshold or
Seller Casualty Threshold, as applicable, and neither party terminates the
Agreement as permitted pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(iv)), Buyer's obligation to
effect the Closing shall not be affected and Buyer and Seller shall mutually
resolve the Repair Cost Dispute after the Closing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.3 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the engineering
company or other appropriate specialist shall be deemed to be the Inspector
for purposes of Section 2.3), with a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase
Price equal to the finally-determined Repair Costs. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (iv) \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section
8.5(f), if the Repair Costs as agreed to by Buyer and the applicable Seller
or the Third-Party Estimate, as applicable, (A) is equal to or greater than
the Buyer Casualty Threshold, Buyer may elect, by giving Sellers written
notice of election within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Third-Party
Estimate, or (B) is equal to or greater than the Seller Casualty Threshold,
Sellers may elect, by giving Buyer written notice of election within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the Third Party Estimate, to terminate this Agreement
without further obligation hereunder, except as provided in Section 11.2. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tCondemnation Awards. In the event of any reduction in
the Purchase Price in connection with a Taking at one or more of the Ethanol
Plants, as provided in Section 8.5(a), Buyer shall be entitled to collect from
any condemnor the entire award(s) that may be made in any such proceeding,
without deduction, to be paid out as follows: subject to actual receipt of
such award(s) by Buyer, (a) Buyer shall pay to Sellers all such amounts, up to
the amount of such Purchase Price reduction, and (b) Buyer shall be entitled
to retain the balance (if any) of such award(s). Sellers shall not settle any
condemnation or eminent domain proceeding relating to an Ethanol Plant without
Buyer's prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tPurchase Price Adjustment. Any adjustment of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.5(b) which is necessary to reflect a
final determination of Repair Costs after the Closing shall be made as
follows: (a) an adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be paid in cash by Sellers;
and (b) an adjustment in favor of Sellers shall be paid in cash to the extent
the Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to this Section 8.5. Any such
reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after
such final determination. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tDeferral of Closing Date and End Date. In the event of
a Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and the End Date shall be deferred
until (a) three (3) Business Days after  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t36  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

receipt of the Third-Party Estimate, or (b) if Sellers elect the option in
clause (A) of Section 8.5(b)(i), as provided therein, but in no event beyond
the Casualty Event Termination Date. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tPartial Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if (A) the Riga Plant sustains a Casualty or Taking where the
Repair Costs are equal to or exceed 10% of the Riga Plant Allocation or the
Riga Plant cannot reasonably be expected to be fully repaired prior to the
Casualty Event Termination Date, or (B) the Lakota Plant sustains a Casualty
or Taking where the Repair Costs are equal to or exceed 10% of the Lakota
Plant Allocation or the Lakota Plant cannot reasonably be expected to be fully
repaired prior to the Casualty Event Termination Date, and Buyer or Sellers
elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 8.5(b)(iv), the
termination shall be a partial termination of this Agreement as it relates
only to the Riga Plant or Lakota Plant that sustained the Casualty or Taking
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the other two
Ethanol Plants. The Parties agree to amend the relevant terms of this
Agreement, including the Purchase Price, to reflect this partial termination.

faith determination and calculation, acting reasonably).

reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tEach Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its

 \t\t\t\t 10.5 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedures. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThird Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other
legal proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of
the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 10.5(b),  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t42  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to Section 10.5(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
Section 6.10) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tSettlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as provided in this Section 10.5(b). If a firm offer is made
to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of
a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section
10.5(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tDirect Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30)-day
period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t43  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Indemnified
Party's premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.6 \t\t\tTax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t 10.7 \t\t\tExclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 12.12, the
parties acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, their sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from
intentional fraud or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
X. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article X. Nothing in this Section 10.7 shall limit any Person's right
to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled
pursuant to Section 12.12 or to seek any remedy on account of any intentional
fraud or willful misconduct by any party hereto.

parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede and replace
any prior understandings and agreements among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede and replace any prior understandings and

matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). The recitals to

economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutual acceptable manner in order that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  \t\t

  \t\t\t48  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThe parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge
and agree that, subject to Section 11.3, (i) the parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transaction and without that right,
neither the Sellers nor Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (b) \t\t\tThe parties agree not to raise any objections to (i) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand; and (ii) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

 \t\t\t\t 12.13 \t\t\tThird Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement
