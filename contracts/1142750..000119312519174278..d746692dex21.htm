as to the Companys good faith estimate of (A) the aggregate amount of Cash of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation
Time, (B) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (C)
the Transaction Expenses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are
unpaid as of the Closing, (D) the aggregate amount of Transaction Bonuses and
related payroll Taxes, and (E) the Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), including in each case reasonable detail with
supporting documentation. If the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, the Closing Stockholder Payment shall be _decreased_ by the Estimated
Adjustment Amount; if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
the Closing Stockholder Payment shall be _increased_ by the Estimated
Adjustment Amount.

 

(c) _Determination of Final Adjustment Amount_. Within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver written notice to the
Stockholder of its calculation of the Adjustment Amount, including reasonable
detail with supporting documentation (the " _Notice of Adjustment Amount_ ").
The Stockholder and any accountants and advisors engaged by the Stockholder
shall be permitted reasonable access to the books and records of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and any documents, schedules or workpapers used
by Purchaser in its calculation of the Adjustment Amount, solely for purposes
of evaluating Purchasers calculation of the Adjustment Amount and making its
own calculation of the Adjustment Amount. If the Stockholder disagrees with
Purchasers calculation of the Adjustment Amount, within forty-five (45) days
after receipt of the Notice of Adjustment Amount, the Stockholder shall
deliver written notice to Purchaser setting forth its calculation of the
Adjustment Amount, including the basis for the disagreement in reasonable
detail (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Stockholder fails to timely
deliver an Objection Notice, Purchasers calculation of the Adjustment Amount
shall be final and binding on Purchaser and the Stockholder. If the
Stockholder timely delivers an Objection Notice to Purchaser, then Purchaser
and the Stockholder shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes as to
the computation of the Adjustment Amount within thirty (30) days after the
date of delivery of the Objection Notice. If Purchaser and the Stockholder
cannot reach agreement on all such disputes within such thirty (30)-day period
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree), then all remaining
disputes as to the computation of the Adjustment Amount shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 1.3(d).

(d) _Dispute Resolution Regarding Adjustment Amount_. In the event that
Purchaser and the Stockholder cannot reach agreement on all disputes as to the
computation of the Adjustment Amount within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Objection Notice (or such longer period as they may mutually agree),
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall jointly submit such disputed determination
to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Stockholder (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for computation or verification of
the Adjustment Amount in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.3.
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall direct the Accounting Firm to review the
matters in dispute and, within thirty (30) days following its engagement (or
within the shortest time frame as the Accounting Firm shall agree), deliver a
written report to Purchaser and the Stockholder setting forth its
determination of the proper amounts of such disputed matters and a
calculation of the Adjustment Amount. The Accounting Firm shall determine only
those items and amounts set

 



3

    

 forth in the Objection Notice that Purchaser and the Stockholder were unable
to resolve. Each of Purchaser and the Stockholder shall be entitled to make a
presentation to the Accounting Firm regarding the items and amounts that they
are unable to resolve, but neither Purchaser nor the Stockholder shall meet
separately with the Accounting Firm without the other partys prior written
consent. In making its determination, the Accounting Firm shall (i) be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the definitions of
Adjustment Amount and Net Working Capital, the methodology for calculating the
Adjustment Amount and Net Working Capital and the terms of this Section
1.3(d), and (ii) not assign any value with respect to a disputed amount that
is greater than the highest value for such amount claimed by either Purchaser
or the Stockholder or that is less than the lowest value for such amount
claimed by either Purchaser or the Stockholder. Purchaser and the Stockholder
shall cooperate with and timely respond to all reasonable requests for
information, books, records and similar items by the Accounting Firm. Except
as provided by the penultimate sentence of Section 1.3(c), the submission of
the disputed matter to the Accounting Firm shall be the exclusive remedy for
resolving disputes related to the determination of the Adjustment Amount, and
the Accounting Firms determination shall be binding upon Purchaser and the
Stockholder. The Accounting Firms fees and expenses shall be borne by the
party whose calculation of the Adjustment Amount was farthest from the
determination of the Adjustment Amount by the Accounting Firm, or, if the
determination of the Adjustment Amount by the Accounting Firm is equidistant
between the calculations of the parties of the Adjustment Amount, shall be
borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholder, on the
other hand.

(e) _Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) _Shortfall_. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.3(c) or Section 1.3(d), is less than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount (the positive amount of such difference, the " _Shortfall_ "), then,
within five (5) Business Days following such determination, the Stockholder
and Purchaser shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release to Purchaser the amount of the Shortfall from the General Escrow Fund
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the Adjustment Escrow Amount
exceeds the Shortfall, in the same joint written instructions, the
Stockholder and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the
Stockholder the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount from the General Escrow
Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 

(ii) _Underpayment_. If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 1.3(c) or Section 1.3(d), is greater than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount (such difference, the " _Underpayment_ "), then, within five (5)
Business Days following such determination, (A) Purchaser shall deposit or
cause to be deposited an amount equal to the Underpayment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, into an account designated in writing by the
Stockholder, and (B) the Stockholder and Purchaser shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Amount to
the Stockholder.

 



4

    

(iii) _Additional Adjustment Amount_. If the Adjustment Amount is
in Purchasers favor, and is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then
Purchaser shall have the option, but not the obligation, to cause the
Stockholder and Purchaser to deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to release to Purchaser such additional amount from the General Escrow
Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser, in
its sole discretion, may elect to receive payment for such additional amount
above the Adjustment Escrow Amount directly from the Stockholder.

1.4. _Earnout Payment_.

 

(a) _Earnout Calculation_. On or before April 30, 2020, Purchaser shall
deliver to the Stockholder a calculation (the " _Earnout Calculation_ ")
setting forth the Company Business EBITDA for the twelve-month period ending
on December 31, 2019 (the " _Measurement Period_ "), and the School Proforma
EBITDA. The Earnout Calculation shall be prepared and calculated in good
faith and shall be based upon the books and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries.

(b)  _Mechanics and Disputes_. The Earnout Calculation shall be conclusive
and binding for purposes of this Agreement unless, within thirty (30) days
after Purchasers delivery of the Earnout Calculation (the "
_Response Period_ "), the Stockholder shall have delivered written notice to
Purchaser of any dispute or disagreement with such calculation (the " _Earnout
Dispute Notice_ "). The Earnout Dispute Notice shall state the basis for
the objection and shall be accompanied by the Stockholders alternative
preparation of such calculation and set forth in reasonable detail the
Stockholders calculation of the various components of the Earnout
Calculation. During the Response Period, upon reasonable advance notice
delivered to Purchaser, the Stockholder and its executive officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financial advisors and representatives (collectively, its " _Representatives_
") shall be granted reasonable access, during normal business hours and
subject to customary confidentiality provisions, to reasonably requested
accounting records of Purchaser or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
the workpapers prepared by Purchaser and/or its Representatives and the
appropriate personnel (as reasonably requested by the Stockholder), in order
to verify the amounts set forth in the Earnout Calculation. If the Stockholder
timely delivers the Earnout Dispute Notice to Purchaser, Purchaser and the
Stockholder shall meet and confer and attempt to resolve the dispute in good
faith. If the Stockholder and Purchaser are unable to resolve such dispute or
disagreement within thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of the
Earnout Dispute Notice (or such longer period as they may mutually agree),
either the Stockholder or Purchaser may submit such dispute or disagreement
for final determination to the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
1.3(d), which shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

(c) _Earnout Payment_. Within five (5) Business Days of the final and binding
determination of the Earnout Calculation pursuant to Sections 1.4(a) and
1.4(b), if the Company Business EBITDA for the Measurement Period _plus_ the
School Proforma EBITDA, subject to the cap set forth below (such sum, the "
_Earnout EBITDA_ "), falls within one of the levels set forth in the table
below (each, a " _Level_ "), then Purchaser shall pay to the Stockholder by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the amount
set forth in the column below titled "Earnout" corresponding to such Level
(the " _Earnout Payment_ "):

          |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  

Level

 |  |

Earnout EBITDA

 |  |

Earnout

 | 
    1 |  | Greater than or equal to $21,147,000 but less than
$21,294,000 |  | $ | 1,000,000 | 
  2 |  | Greater than or equal to $21,294,000 but less than
$21,441,000 |  | $ | 2,000,000 | 
  3 |  | Greater than or equal to $21,441,000 but less than
$21,588,000 |  | $ | 3,000,000 | 
  4 |  | Greater than or equal to $21,588,000 but less than
$21,735,000 |  | $ | 4,000,000 | 
  5 |  | Greater than or equal to $21,735,000 |  | $ | 5,000,000 | 
 

For purposes of calculating the Earnout EBITDA for this Section 1.4(c), only
up to $400,000 of the School Proforma EBITDA shall be included in the
calculation thereof. An example of the calculation of the Earnout Payment is
set forth on _Schedule A_.

 

(d) The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall have the complete right, power and authority to operate and
control the Company Business and the operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in any manner as it shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion, subject to the provisions in this Section 1.4(d). Purchaser owes
no fiduciary duty to the Stockholder with respect to the operation of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, following the Closing and through the end of the Measurement
Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, (i) maintain the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as separate legal entities, (ii) keep the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries books and records in a manner that
will facilitate the recording, compiling and analysis of all information
relevant to the determination and calculation of the Earnout Payment, the
School Proforma EBITDA and the Company Business EBITDA and to enable separate
statements of the financial performance of the Company Business to be
prepared, (iii) not take any action with the purpose of reducing the Earnout
Payment, (iv) not allocate any corporate or other charges from Purchaser or
its affiliates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that would
negatively impact the Earnout Calculation in an amount in excess of the
corresponding corporate or other charge incurred by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries prior to Closing consistent with past practice (provided that if
any such charges are allocated and are greater than the charges incurred by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to Closing, such charges shall
be excluded from the calculations of the Earnout Calculation), (v) operate the
Company Business in good faith and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice of the Company Business (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law), except (1) with respect to certain functions that will be
integrated during the Measurement Period as agreed to by Jennifer Fuicelli,
(2) to the extent reasonably necessary for integration planning or with the
prior consent of Jennifer Fuicelli, and (vi) provide the Stockholder with
quarterly statements of the financial performance of the Company Business for
the second and third calendar quarters of 2019, including the School Proforma
EBITDA and the Company Business EBITDA as of the date of such statements, to
be delivered within forty-five (45) days after the end of such calendar
quarter.

(e) If, during the Measurement Period, Jennifer Fuicellis employment
with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause, then fifty
percent of the maximum amount of the Earnout Payment shall be deemed to be
earned (such amount, the " _Accelerated Payment Amount_ "). Purchaser shall,
within five (5) Business Days following such termination of employment, pay
the Accelerated Payment Amount to the Stockholder by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. In addition, if, during the Measurement Period,
Jennifer Fuicellis

 



6

    

 employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause, then
in accordance with this Section 1.4 (including, without limitation, the
provided time periods for calculation and payment of the Earnout Payment),
the Purchaser shall calculate the total amount of the Earnout Payment and, if
the Accelerated Payment Amount is less than the total earned portion of the
Earnout Payment (as calculated in accordance with Section 1.4(c)), the
Purchaser shall pay such difference to the Stockholder by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with Section 1.4(c).

 

(f) The parties understand and agree that (A) the contingent right to receive
the Earnout Payment shall not be represented by any form of certificate or
other instrument, is not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to
descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and does not
constitute an equity or ownership interest in Purchaser, the Company, or any
Company Subsidiary, (B) the Stockholder shall not have any rights as a
securityholder of Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary as a
result of the Stockholders contingent right to receive the Earnout Payment,
(C) no interest is payable with respect to the Earnout Payment or any other
payment due to the Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, (D) the Earnout
Payment shall be reflected as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes, and (E) if any portion of the Earnout Payment requires processing
or payment through the Purchaser or its affiliates (including the Company
after the Closing), any such amounts shall be net of both the employer and
employee portions of any payroll Taxes required as a result of such
distributions to employees, such that any such payroll Taxes shall solely be
paid out of or withheld from the Earnout Payment.

 

1.5. _Closing_.

(a) The closing of the Acquisition (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place by
electronic delivery or by physical exchange of documentation at the offices of
Alston and Bird LLP, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, at
10:00 a.m., Pacific time (i) on the date most promptly practicable following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other
than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
Closing), but in no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day following
such date or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as
Purchaser and the Stockholder may mutually agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ ". The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific
Time, on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(b) All deliveries, payments and other transactions and documents relating to
the Closing (i) shall be independent and shall not be effective unless and
until all are effective (except to the extent that the party entitled to the
benefit thereof has waived satisfaction or performance thereof as a condition
precedent to the Closing), and (ii) shall be deemed to be consummated
simultaneously.

Company Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign entity to do business and is
in good standing (to the extent applicable) in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties, rights and assets and to
carry on its business as it has been and is now being conducted.

(c) _Section 2.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct

_Company Subsidiaries_ "), together with the jurisdiction of organization of
each Company Subsidiary and the number and class of the outstanding equity
interests of each Company Subsidiary owned by any Person. Except for the

of the Transactions by the Company have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary action, and no other proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize the Companys execution, delivery, and performance of
the Acquisition Documents or consummation of the Transactions. The
Acquisition Documents have been or will be, as the case may be, duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser and each other party
thereto, constitute or will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their
respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable
principles.

2.3. _Organizational Documents; Books and Records_.

warrants, convertible securities, calls, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal or other rights, or agreements or commitments of any nature obligating

(c) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any equity
interests in the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person. There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings relating to voting

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

2.5. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Acquisition
Documents do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i)
conflict

 



9

Subsidiary, or any of their dependents, or with respect to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary has any Liability (collectively, the " _Benefit
Plans_ ").

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or had an
obligation to contribute to (i) a "single employer plan" (as such term is

Section 302 of Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" (meaning a plan sponsored by more than one employer within the

has been maintained, funded, tested and administered in all material respects
in accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and applicable Law. No
contributions or payments are due or required to be paid by the Company or any

 times complied with the requirements of Code Section 4980H, including the
distribution of a "summary of benefits and coverage" to employees and
calculations of full-time employees and full-time equivalent employees, and
no "Employer Shared Responsibility" payments described in Code Section 4980H
have been incurred or will be incurred for any period prior to Closing. All
Persons being provided coverage under any Benefit Plan are described in such

former employees (and spouses and dependents thereof) of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary are provided coverage under any Benefit Plan (other than
any consulting or independent contractor agreements).

(d) No "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or

respect to any Benefit Plan has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) or any
other breach of fiduciary responsibility with respect to any Benefit Plan
subject to ERISA that reasonably could be expected to subject the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or their employees to (i) any material Tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) any
material Liability under Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA. All reports, forms

Plan that constitutes in any part a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), and each such Benefit Plan has
been maintained and operated in operational and documentary compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder. No payment to be
made to any of the current or former employees, independent contractors,
directors, managers or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
any of their dependents under any Benefit Plan is or will be subject to the
penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. With respect to any of the
current or former employees, independent contractors, directors, managers or
officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their dependents,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any indemnity or gross-up
obligation for any excise taxes or penalties or interest imposed or
accelerated under Section 409A of the Code or has been required to report to
any Governmental Authority any correction or taxes due as a result of a
failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, or with
respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the IRS to the
prototype plan sponsor, to the effect that such Benefit Plan is so qualified
and that the trust related thereto is exempt from taxation under 501(a) of
the Code, and nothing has occurred nor any conditions exist with respect to
such Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to cause the revocation of
such determination letter from the IRS or the unavailability of reliance on
such opinion letter from the IRS. The Advanced Medical Personnel Services,
Inc. Welfare Benefit Plan, dated September 1, 2016, is nondiscriminatory with
respect to eligibility and benefits under the Code, including, without
limitation, Code §§105(h), 125, and 79.

existing debts as they mature), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with
which to engage in its business, or (iii) have incurred debts or obligations
beyond its ability to pay them in the ordinary course of business as they
become due.

3.7. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties set forth in this ARTICLE III, neither the Stockholder nor any

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

 

Purchaser represents and warrants to the Stockholder that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct as of the date hereof:

4.1. _Organization and Qualification; Authority_.

 

(a) Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Nevada. Purchaser is duly qualified
as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing (to the extent
applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties, rights and assets and to carry on its business as it has been
and is now being conducted.

4.2. _Authorization and Validity_. Purchaser has the full power and authority
necessary to execute and deliver the Acquisition Documents, to perform its
obligations under the Acquisition Documents and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of the Acquisition
Documents by Purchaser and the consummation of the Transactions by Purchaser
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Purchaser, and no other proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to
authorize Purchasers execution, delivery, and performance of the Acquisition
Documents or consummation of the Transactions. The Acquisition Documents have
been or will be, as the case may be, duly and validly executed and delivered
by Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each other party thereto, constitute or will constitute a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance
with their respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally or by
general equitable principles.

4.3. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of the Acquisition
Documents do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i)
conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Purchaser, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 4.3(b) have been obtained or taken and all
filings and obligations described in Section 4.3(b) have been made or
fulfilled, conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable to Purchaser
or by which Purchaser or any of its properties or assets is bound, or (iii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in Section 4.3(b) have been obtained or taken and all filings and
obligations described in Section 4.3(b) have been made or fulfilled,
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, or acceleration of any material contract, agreement,
instrument, license or permit applicable to Purchaser or by which any of its
properties or assets is bound, except with

 



32

    

 respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, to the extent any such conflict,
violation, breach or default would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.3(b)_ , the execution, delivery and
performance by Purchaser of the Acquisition Documents do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions by Purchaser will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person.

 

4.4. _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser, or Orders binding on Purchaser or
any of its properties or assets, in each case that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.5.  _Brokers_. Except as specifically set forth on any funds flow or
closing statement executed in connection with this Agreement, neither
Purchaser, nor any of its officers, directors or employees has employed any
broker, finder or investment banker or incurred any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions.

4.6. _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the Acquisition and the
other Transactions, neither Purchaser nor the Company will (i) be insolvent
(either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is
greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable
value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts as they mature), (ii) have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in its business, or (iii) have incurred debts or
obligations beyond its ability to pay them in the ordinary course of business
as they become due.

4.7.  _Sufficiency of Funds_. Purchaser has sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the
Purchase Price and the Earnout Payment (when and if due) and consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.8. _Restricted Securities_. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account, with the intention of holding the Shares for investment and not with
a view to the resale or distribution of any part of the Shares, and Purchaser
does not have any present intention of selling, granting any participation in
or otherwise distributing the Shares. Purchaser understands that the Shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by
reason of specific exemptions from the registration provisions, which depend
upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and
the accuracy of Purchasers representations as expressed in this Agreement.
Purchaser understands that the Shares are "restricted securities" under
applicable U.S. federal and state securities Laws and that, pursuant to these
Laws, Purchaser must hold the Shares indefinitely unless they are registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities
or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is
available.

4.9. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties set forth in this ARTICLE IV, neither Purchaser nor any other
Person has made or makes any other representations or warranties, written or
oral, express or implied, with respect to Purchaser.

 



33

    

4.10. _No Reliance_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Stockholder
and the Company have not made, and are not making, any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, except for those representations and warranties of the Stockholder
and the Company expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Acquisition
Documents, and Purchaser is not relying and has not relied on any other
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied.

the right to control or direct the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

5.2. _Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate with one
another in determining which filings are required to be made by each party
prior to the Closing with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained by each party prior to the
Closing from, Governmental Authorities or other Persons in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, and (ii) assist one another in timely making all such filings
and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and
waivers required to be made and obtained by the other parties. Prior to making
any application to or filing with any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement, each party shall provide one another with drafts of such
application or filing

 



36

    

 (excluding any confidential information included therein) and afford one
another a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts. Each of the
parties shall promptly furnish all information required to be included in any
such application or filing with any Governmental Authority. Except as provided
by Section 5.2(b), each party shall bear its own costs, fees and expenses
payable to any Governmental Authority in connection with any required
notification or filing made or given to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.2(a), the Company and Purchaser shall (i) file
as soon as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the
date of this Agreement, all required notifications under the HSR Act, and (ii)
consult and fully cooperate with and provide assistance to one another in
seeking early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act. Purchaser
shall bear the fees of any filing required under the HSR Act. The parties
shall not knowingly impede or delay the termination or expiration of any
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the Federal
Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties. Neither the Company nor Purchaser shall withdraw
its initial filing under the HSR Act, regardless of whether such party intends
to re-file such filing, without the prior written consent of the other
parties (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Each of the parties shall, in connection with antitrust matters related
to the Transactions, (i) promptly respond to and comply with any inquiries
and/or requests for information or documents received from any Governmental
Authority, (ii) promptly notify one another of any communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Authority, and
(iii) subject to applicable Law and to the extent practicable, permit one
another to review in advance and consult, if appropriate, regarding any
proposed written or oral communication with any Governmental Authority and
incorporate the other parties reasonable comments. None of the parties shall
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any filing, investigation or inquiry regarding this Agreement
or the Transactions unless it consults with the other parties in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the others
the opportunity to attend and participate. Each of the parties shall, in a
manner that protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege,
furnish one another with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between such party or its affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation
of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser shall be entitled to direct the
antitrust defense of the transactions contemplated herein in any
investigation or litigation, including in connection with negotiations with
any Governmental Authority regarding the resolution of any investigation or
litigation and (ii) in no event will the Purchaser or any of its affiliates
be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to
enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any
operational restriction, or take any other action that, in the reasonable
judgment of the Purchaser, could be expected to

 



37

    

 limit the right of the Purchaser to own or operate all or any portion of
their respective businesses or assets. The Stockholder and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide support and assistance of the
Purchaser in all material respects in all such investigations and litigation
to the extent required by the Purchaser.

 

(e) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, acquire or
enter into a binding agreement to acquire, in any manner, any assets or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, if such acquisition or entry into a binding agreement would:
(i) impose any delay in obtaining, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
any consent by a Governmental Authority required to consummate the
Transactions, including termination or expiration of any waiting period under
the HSR Act, or (ii) prevent the consummation of the Transactions.

 

5.3. _Reasonable Assistance_. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such
actions, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in taking such
action, as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate, as expeditiously as
practicable, the Acquisition and the other Transactions on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each party, at the
reasonable request of the other parties, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting completely this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions.

5.4. _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, (i) provide Purchaser and its
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives, consultants and
financing sources (collectively, the " _Purchaser Representatives_ ")
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to
the offices, facilities, books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries executive
officers, directors, managers, key employees, agents, counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, financial advisors, key consultants and representatives
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ "), and (ii) furnish or make
available to Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives such financial and
operating data and such other information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as Purchaser or the Purchaser Representatives may from
time to time reasonably request. Purchaser and the Purchaser Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in a manner as to minimize the disruption
to, and not to unreasonably interfere with, the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries business and operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of the Purchaser Representatives shall
contact any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, supplier,
payor, client, or patient of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in
connection with any information or matter regarding the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or their business, operations or prospects, without the
prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may
withhold (i) information that, if disclosed, would violate an attorney-client
or other privilege or would constitute a waiver of rights as to attorney work
product or attorney client privilege, or (ii) information, the disclosure of
which would violate applicable Law, such as portions of documents or
information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive,
if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as
determined

 



38

    

 by the Companys legal counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust
compliance questions for such party (or any of its affiliates). If any
information is withheld by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, it
shall inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld;
provided, that, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to determine
a method to disclose such information if it is deemed material by the
Purchaser, including, without limitation, providing redacted portions thereof,
entering into a clean team agreement or joint defense agreement, or providing
such material for "attorneys eyes only". Except as otherwise agreed to by
the Company, and notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of November , 2018
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Purchaser and Piper
Jaffray, on its behalf and in its capacity as agent for the Company, shall
apply to all information furnished to Purchaser or any Purchaser
Representative by any Company Representative under this Agreement.

 

5.5. _Public Announcements_. Any public announcements, reports, statements or
press releases by any party hereto or any of its affiliates regarding the
Transactions must be approved in advance (as to form, content, timing and
manner of distribution) by each of Purchaser and the Stockholder, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
that Purchaser may issue a press release or make a public announcement or
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission without the approval of the
Stockholder to the extent necessary for Purchaser or its affiliates to comply
with applicable securities Laws or New York Stock Exchange rules. Purchaser
shall provide a copy to the Stockholder of any such required press release or
announcement in advance of its release such as to provide the Stockholder a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such press release or
announcement, and Purchaser shall consider any such comments by Stockholder in
good faith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholder and its affiliates may use the Companys name and logo in
communications to its current or prospective investors, lenders or affiliates
and on its website.

5.6. _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

5.7. _No Shop_. Until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, neither the Stockholder nor the Company shall, and the Company
shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, through
any officer, director, manager, employee, affiliate, agent, intermediary or
other Representative of the Stockholder or the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or otherwise: (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
submission of proposals or offers from any Person relating to any purchase of
the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys assets, other than any purchase
of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or
any purchase of immaterial assets, or any equity securities or any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
reclassification or other similar transaction involving the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise respond to, cooperate or encourage,
any effort or attempt by any other Person to make an Acquisition Proposal; or
(c) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or any other transaction that would have the effect of
preventing or limiting the Acquisition. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day of learning of the relevant information) notify
Purchaser if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with

 



39

    

 respect to any of the foregoing, together with the material details of such
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact, and, to the extent not prohibited by any
confidentiality obligations existing as of the date of this Agreement, the
identity of the potential purchaser.

5.8. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) All equity transfer, sales, use, excise, controlling interest, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Transactions (regardless of the Person on whom
such Transfer Taxes are imposed by Law) shall be paid by Purchaser when due,
and each party to this Agreement shall cooperate with the other parties in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

 

(b) Following the Closing, the Stockholder, at its sole cost and expense,
shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
income Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing
Period_"). All Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Period shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file, or
shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, (i) all non-income Tax Returns
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period that are not due until after the Closing Date, and (ii) all
Tax Returns with respect to any taxable period beginning before and ending
after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ "). Any such Tax Returns prepared
by Purchaser that relate to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (except where such change is made to comply with
applicable Law). Purchaser shall provide the Stockholder with completed
drafts of such Tax Returns for the Stockholders review and comment at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the filing
thereof (unless such due date is less than thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date, in which case, Purchaser shall provide the Stockholder with completed
drafts of such Tax Returns for the Stockholders review and comment as soon as
practically possible). The Stockholder shall deliver comments to such Tax
Returns to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days following the Stockholders
receipt of such Tax Returns (or such shorter time as requested in response to
a short filing period), and the Purchaser shall make such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder. The Stockholder
agrees to provide Purchaser with such information as is necessary or
appropriate to permit Purchaser to fulfill its Tax Return filing requirements
under this Section 5.8(c).

 

(d) If the Company is permitted but not required under applicable Law to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the parties hereto
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to elect
to (or otherwise) treat the Closing Date as the last day of such taxable
period. The Stockholder shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser in accordance with Article VIII from and against, any
Tax with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
attributable to a Pre-Closing Period or to that portion of a Straddle Period
that ends on the Closing Date. For

 



40

    

 purposes of this Section 5.8, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount
of any Taxes based on or measured by income, gross or net sales, payroll,
payments or receipts of the Company for the Pre-Closing Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time,
and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period which
relate to the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on and including
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. Also for purposes of this Section 5.8, any responsibility for
Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Period or that portion of the Straddle
Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be determined by treating all
deductions arising in connection with the Transactions (other than deductions
in connection with all costs and expenses related to the Earnout Payment or
performance-based bonus payments (not including option payments) paid by
Purchaser or its affiliates to certain employees following the Closing) as
properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Period (assuming, for this purpose,
that the safe harbor election provided for in IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-29 is
made with respect to any such deduction that constitutes a "success-based fee"
and that a rule similar to the "next-day rule" contained in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) is not applicable to any such
deduction) and the parties agree to report and file all Tax Returns
consistently. Furthermore, during the period between when Closing actually
occurs and 11:59pm PT on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not take any action
outside of the ordinary course of business that results in an increased Tax
liability or a loss of a deduction for the Company for a Pre-Closing Period or
that portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date; provided,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any deductions taken by the Purchaser after
the Closing Date shall be allocable to the Purchaser (or its affiliates,
including the Company after the Closing Date).

 

(e) Except to the extent reflected as an asset in the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount, the Stockholder shall be entitled to any refund or credit
of Taxes attributable to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Period or to that portion of the Straddle Period that ends on the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such refunds or credits as reasonably requested by Stockholder, at
Stockholders sole cost and expense, and shall pay to the Stockholder any such
refund or credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement
thereto by Purchaser.

(f) The parties shall provide each other, at the expense of the requesting
party, with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any Governmental Authority, or any Actions relating to
Liability for Taxes, and each will retain for the applicable statute of
limitations and provide to the requesting party any records or information
that may be relevant to any of the foregoing. Subject to the following
sentences, the Purchaser will have the right to control, with its own counsel
at its own expense (which expenses, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
considered Losses to the extent that a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification in respect of such Action under ARTICLE VIII), any Actions
relating to Liability for Taxes for the Company for any taxable period
(including a Pre-Closing Period), including any disposition of such Action;
provided, that Stockholder will have the right, directly or through its
designated Representatives, with respect to any Action relating to the Pre-
Closing Period or the Straddle Period to participate in any such Action and to
review in advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of any
such Action (including any

 



41

    

 administrative appeals thereof), and Stockholders consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any
settlement of such Action by the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Stockholder will have the right to control, with its own counsel at its own
expense, the defense of the IRS Audit, including any disposition of the IRS
Audit; provided, that (i) Purchasers counsel shall be joint defense counsel,
with all rights and responsibilities associated therewith, (ii) the lead
counsel retained by the Company to defend the IRS Audit as of the date of this
Agreement continues to serve as lead counsel to such defense (or, if the
Stockholder reasonably believes that it must replace such lead counsel,
Stockholder appoints new lead counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser); and
(iii) the Stockholder promptly (A) informs Purchaser of all
material developments in the IRS Audit, (B) provides Purchaser with copies of
all material written correspondence, discovery, pleadings, filings, and Orders
received or delivered by the Stockholder related to the IRS Audit, and (C)
provides Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of, and permits Purchaser
to participate in, all planned meetings, telephone conferences, hearings, and
related conferences with the IRS with respect to the IRS Audit. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser, with its own counsel and at its own expense
(which expenses, for the avoidance of doubt, shall _not_ be considered
Losses), will have the right to joint defense of the IRS Audit. Stockholder
shall not settle or compromise (or attempt to settle or compromise) or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the IRS Audit without the
prior consent of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) would require
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or Purchaser to make any change to its
operations, or (ii) would increase Purchasers Tax Liability for any period
after the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 5.8(f) shall
take priority over the comparable provisions contained in ARTICLE VIII.

(g) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its affiliates shall (i) amend any
previously filed Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any
Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period, (ii) except as set forth in Section
5.8(h), file any Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle
Period in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
previously did not file Tax Returns, (iii) waive the statute of limitations
or extend the period for the assessment or collection with respect to any Tax
or Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing
Period or any Straddle Period, (iv) make any Tax election with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that has effect for any Pre-Closing Period
or any Straddle Period, including any election under Section 338 of the Code
or other similar election, or (v) except as set forth in Section 5.8(h),
enter into any voluntary disclosure or compliance procedures with respect to
any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
any Pre-Closing Period, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following the Closing,
each of Purchaser, the Company and each of their respective affiliates and
agents shall have the right to contact state and local taxing authorities (the
" _Taxing Authorities_ ") in each of the jurisdictions listed on _Schedule
5.8(h)_ (each, an " _Identified State_ ") and enter into a "voluntary
disclosure agreement", amnesty program, or other similar program with any such
Taxing Authority relating to sales or use taxes (or any analogous state or
local Taxes) attributable to a Pre-Closing Period (each, a " _VDA Proceeding_
"). The Purchaser shall have the right to control any process or proceeding
(including the amendment, preparation and filing of sales or use Tax 

 



42

    

 Returns and all other Tax Returns as required by the relevant Taxing
Authorities) relating to any such VDA Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the amendment, preparation and filing of any sales or
use Tax Return and any other Tax Returns required to be filed pursuant to a
VDA Proceeding, shall be governed by this Section 5.8(h). For the avoidance of
doubt, any amounts due to a Taxing Authority pursuant to a VDA Proceeding and
any Losses incurred in connection with the VDA Proceeding shall be subject to
indemnification by the Stockholder in accordance with Section 8.1(a)(vi);
provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Stockholder shall not have any indemnification obligation for
such Losses in excess of $250,000.

(i) Prior to Closing, Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall pay its full
income Tax payable balance, such that Purchaser shall assume a balance sheet
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that reflects zero dollars ($0)
income Tax payable. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser and any
accountants and advisors engaged by the Purchaser shall be permitted
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and any documents, schedules or workpapers used by
the Stockholder (or its affiliates) in its calculation of such income Tax
payable balance prior to Closing, solely for purposes of evaluating
Stockholders calculation of such income Tax payable balance prior to Closing.

 

(j) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Purchaser and the
Company will endeavor to reasonably determine whether the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
entitle any Person who is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code) (each such person, a " _280G Individual_ ") to a
"parachute payment" (as reasonably determined within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) absent approval by the stockholders of the Company.
If the Purchaser and the Company reasonably determine such is the case then
the Company will (A) no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each such 280G
Individual a waiver of such 280G Individuals rights to some or all of such
payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining
payments and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be parachute
payments; and (B) prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each 280G
Individual who agrees to the waiver described in clause (i), submit to all
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote (along with adequate disclosure
satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and
any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any such 280G Individual
to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and
approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval
materials to Purchaser for its review and approval (which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser and its
affiliates agree to not provide or enter into any arrangement, separately or
in the aggregate with any existing arrangements, with any disqualified
individual after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing
Date that would provide for any "parachute payments". Purchaser and the
Company agree to cooperate to take actions to mitigate the impact of Sections
4999 and 280G of the Code, as may be permitted under the Code.

5.9. _Restrictive Covenants._

 



43

    

In further consideration, and as a condition and inducement to Purchasers
willingness to purchase the Shares for the Purchase Price and to protect the
value of the Shares (including the customer relationships and goodwill in the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing), the Stockholder
covenants and agrees as follows from and after the Closing:

(a) Neither the Stockholder, its affiliates, nor their respective
Representatives shall, at any time, directly or indirectly, disclose,
divulge, or make known to any Person, use, or otherwise appropriate for its
own benefit or the benefit of other Persons any Confidential Information, or
permit any Person to examine or make copies of any documents that contain or
are derived from the Confidential Information. The Stockholder agrees to take
reasonable measures to prevent the inadvertent or accidental disclosure of
Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Confidential Information_ " means any confidential or proprietary matters
concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including business
procedures and practices, methodologies, contents of manuals, the identity of
referral sources, vendors and suppliers, information contained in the books
and records of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and their affiliates,
financial information, pricing and marketing plans and information, trade
secrets, know-how, business plans, projections, forecasts, budgets, and the
names and addresses of customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions,
the Stockholder may disclose Confidential Information to the extent it has
become generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure
by the Stockholder or the breach by the Stockholder of its obligations under
this Agreement. The obligations under this Section 5.9(a) are in addition to
and not in lieu of any other rights or obligations, at law or in equity, to
maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including under
applicable "trade secret" laws.

 

(b) In the event the Stockholder is requested or required (by Law or by
litigation discovery requests, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or
similar processes) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Stockholder
agrees to provide Purchaser with prompt written notice of such request or
requirements so that Purchaser and the Company may, at their sole cost and
expense, seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5.9(a). If, in the absence of a protective order or
a receipt of a waiver by Purchaser or the Company, the Stockholder is
nonetheless, upon the written advice of its counsel, legally compelled to
disclose Confidential Information, the Stockholder may, without liability to
Purchaser or the Company under this Agreement, disclose that portion of the
Confidential Information that the Stockholder is advised in writing by its
counsel is legally required; _provided_ that the Stockholder shall cooperate
with Purchaser and the Company to obtain an appropriate protective order, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense. The Stockholder acknowledges and agrees
that the prohibitions against disclosure of Confidential Information in this
Agreement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that
Purchaser may have available pursuant to the Laws of any jurisdiction or at
common law to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information, and the
enforcement by Purchaser of its rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or available remedies
that Purchaser may possess in law or equity.

5.10. _Director and Officer Indemnification; Tail Policies_. For a period of
six (6) years after the Closing Date, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to amend, repeal or modify any provision in its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents)

 



44

    

 relating to the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
any of its current or former officers or directors (the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_"), it being the intent of the parties that the DandO Indemnified
Parties shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the fullest extent of the Law. On or prior to the
Closing, the Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall have purchased an
irrevocable "tail" insurance policy with respect to the DandO Indemnified
Parties existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage, which
shall provide such insurance coverage for six (6) years following the Closing
Date (including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions) on terms with respect to such coverage and in
amounts no less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement. On or prior to the Closing,
the Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall have also purchased an
irrevocable "tail" insurance policy with respect to the Companys existing
professional liability insurance coverage (which shall include both base and
umbrella coverage), which shall provide such insurance coverage for three (3)
years following the Closing Date on terms with respect to such coverage and
in amounts no less favorable to the Company than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement. Purchaser will not, or will cause the
Company to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect. If
Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. The provisions of this Section
5.10 are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have had by contract or otherwise.

 

5.11. _R andW Policy_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall obtain a binding buyer-side representation and warranty
insurance policy in form and substance as attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the
" _R andW Policy_"). Neither Purchaser nor any of its affiliates, nor any of
their respective Representatives, shall take action with the intention of
causing the RandW Policy or the rights of any party thereunder to be terminated,
cancelled, amended, or waived in a manner that could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse impact on the Stockholder or any of its affiliates, or any of
the Stockholders Representatives. The cost of the premiums together with all
taxes and application, underwriting or similar other fees or expenses (the "
_R andW Premium_") in connection with obtaining and maintaining the RandW Policy
shall be borne by Purchaser.

5.12. _Notice of Developments_. Prior to the Closing, the Stockholder and the
Company, on one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, will give prompt
written notice to the other parties of (a) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that causes, caused, constitutes or constituted a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of such party (or parties)
contained in this Agreement at any time on or after the date of this Agreement
and on or prior to the Closing Date (as though made at such time), (b) any
event, condition, fact or circumstance that may be reasonably likely to cause
any of the conditions to Closing not to be satisfied, and (c) the failure of
such party (or parties) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any 

 



45

    

 covenant to be complied with by it hereunder. No such notification will, in
any way, limit, qualify, modify or affect the representations or warranties of
such party (or parties) or the other parties remedies or the conditions to
their respective obligations hereunder, nor impair the ability of the other
parties to rely on such representations and warranties.

 

5.13. _Financial Statements_. Promptly upon the completion thereof, prior to
the Closing Date, the Stockholder shall provide the Purchaser with each
regularly prepared monthly, quarterly, and annual consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and related unaudited statements of operations and cash flows.

Closing, by Purchaser or the Stockholder if:

 

(a) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before October 29, 2019
(the " _Outside Date_ "), _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2(a) shall not be available to any party
whose breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation under this
Agreement or whose action or failure to act has been the principal cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Acquisition to have been consummated on or

deemed to be the breach, act or failure to act of the Stockholder under this
Section 7.2(a)); or

this Agreement (in either case, a " _Company Terminating Breach_ "), and such

set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or (b), and (ii) if such breach is reasonably
capable of being cured, such breach shall not have been cured prior to the
earlier of (x) thirty (30) days following notice of such breach received by

Purchaser

 



49

    

 Terminating Breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set

pursuant to this Section 7.4 if there is an uncured Company Terminating

consummate the Acquisition in accordance with Section 1.5, such failure shall
constitute a Purchaser Terminating Breach.

Agreement pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, this Agreement shall immediately
become null and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of
any party or its officers, directors, managers, employees,
stockholders, members, affiliates and agents; _provided_ , that (a)
termination of this Agreement shall have no impact on any rights a party may
have against another party for any breach of this Agreement by such other
party prior to the termination of this Agreement, and (b) the provisions of
the last sentence of Section 5.4 and the provisions of Section 5.5, this

and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, representatives and agents (each, a " _Stockholder Indemnified
Party_ "), from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any
such party, if and to the extent such Losses are suffered or incurred by
reason of, or arising out of, any of the following:

 



51

    

(i) The breach or failure of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement to be true and correct when made or
deemed made under the terms hereof; and

(ii) The breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or the Company
contained in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing.

(b) No claim for indemnification may be made under Section 8.2 unless written
notice, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, has been
given to Purchaser:

 

(i) at any time prior to sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute
of limitations applicable to the underlying claim (or if there is no
applicable statute of limitations, at any time until the date that is three
(3) years after the Closing Date), with respect to any claim brought for a
misrepresentation or breach of Sections 4.1 (Organization and Qualification;
Authority), 4.2 (Authorization and Validity) or 4.5 (Brokers);

(ii) at any time on or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, with respect to any claim brought for a misrepresentation or
breach of any other representation or warranty; and

 

(iii) at any time on or prior to sixty (60) days following the last date of
required performance, with respect to any claim brought under Section
8.2(a)(ii).

(c) The right to indemnification with respect to any claim for which notice
has been properly and timely given in accordance with Section 8.3 and the
time periods set forth Section 8.2(b) shall expire upon the final resolution
of such claim.

 

8.3. _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII is referred to herein as the "
_Indemnified Party_ " and the party against whom such claim for
indemnification is asserted under this ARTICLE VIII is referred to herein as
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ". All claims for indemnification under
this ARTICLE VIII will be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(i) If the Indemnified Party becomes aware of a claim being asserted by a
Third Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that the Indemnified Party believes
may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third-Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the Third-Party
Claim, including copies of all complaints, summons, petitions, demand letters
and all reasonably available documents or other information relating to such
Third-Party Claim and indicating the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party.

 



52

    

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 8.3(a)(iii), the Purchaser shall
be entitled to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim (other than any
Third-Party Claim relating to Indemnified Taxes, which shall be governed by
Section 5.8), with its own counsel and at its own expense (which expenses, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be considered Losses to the extent that a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification in respect of such
Third-Party Claim); provided, that, the Stockholder shall be entitled to
participate, with its own counsel and at its own cost and expense, in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim that is the subject of a notice given by a
Stockholder Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a). In addition, the Stockholder shall be entitled to control the
defense of any Third-Party Claim for which a Stockholder Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification, with its own counsel and at its own expense
(which expenses, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be considered Losses), if
the Purchaser (A) has not notified the Stockholder of its intention to defend
the Third-Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of an
indemnification notice by a Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Section 8.3(a) or (B) does not actively pursue the defense of such
Third-Party Claim. If the Stockholder is entitled to control the defense of a
Third-Party Claim pursuant to the previous sentence, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate, with its own counsel and at its own cost and expense
(which expenses, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be considered Losses),
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(iii) The Purchaser shall also be entitled to control the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with respect to the matter set forth on Schedule
8.1(a)(vii), with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided, that, that
the Stockholder shall be entitled to participate, with its own counsel and at
its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. With
respect to such Third-Party Claim, Purchaser shall (A) conduct the defense of
such Third-Party Claim actively and diligently with the lead counsel retained
by the Company to defend such matter as of the date of this Agreement (or, if
Purchaser reasonably believes that it must replace such lead counsel,
Purchaser appoints new lead counsel reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder),
(B) promptly inform the Stockholder of all material developments in such
Third-Party Claim, (C) to the extent as would not violate attorney-client
privilege, provide the Stockholder with copies of all material written
correspondence, pleadings, filings, and Orders received or delivered by
Purchaser related to such Third-Party Claim, and (D) provide the Stockholder
with reasonable advance notice of, and permits the Stockholder to participate
in, all planned meetings, telephone conferences, hearings, and related
conferences with the Third Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The
Purchaser shall not be entitled to enter into (or attempt to enter into) any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder (which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise or consent to entry of
judgment requires the payment of funds by the Stockholder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall be entitled to settle such Third-Party Claim
without the prior

 



53

    

 written consent of the Stockholder in accordance with the terms of that
certain Memorandum of Understanding dated April 16, 2019.

 

(iv) With respect to any Third-Party Claim not set forth in Section
8.3(a)(iii), the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to enter into (or
attempt to enter into) any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise
or consent to entry of judgment: (A) requires the payment of funds by the
Indemnifying Party, (B) involves any finding or admission of any violation
of any Law or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnifying Party, or (C) if
the Stockholder is the Indemnified Party, restricts the ability of the
Purchaser and the Company to operate or manage the Company Business.

 

(v) With respect to any Third-Party Claim not set forth in Section
8.3(a)(iii), the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to enter into (or
attempt to enter into) any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise
or consent to entry of judgment: (A) requires the payment of funds by the
Indemnified Party, or (B) provides for any relief other than monetary damages
or does not provide an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party.

(vi) A party shall only be liable for indemnification of a Third-Party Claim
by agreement of such party or otherwise pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including
pursuant to Section 9.10 as provided by Section 8.3(c)), and any settlement or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgement entered into by an
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim shall not
conclusively establish whether Losses were incurred with respect to such
Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is required hereunder or the
amount of indemnifiable Losses.

(b) _Non-Third-Party Claims_. In the event the Indemnified Party has a claim
hereunder that does not involve a claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected by a Third Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness send written notice with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying
Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim.

(c) _Objection to Claims_. If, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date
the Indemnifying Party receives notice in accordance with Section 8.3(a) or
8.3(b), the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party in
writing that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of such
claim shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party under
this ARTICLE VIII (subject to the limits of this ARTICLE VIII). In case the
Indemnifying Party timely objects in writing to any claim made in accordance
with Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b), the Indemnified Party shall have fifteen (15)
calendar days to respond in a

 



54

    

 written statement to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such
fifteen (15) calendar day period there remains a dispute as to any claim, the
parties shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) calendar days to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to such claim. If the
parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties. If the parties do not so agree, the
parties will resolve the conflict by any legally available means consistent
with Section 9.10.

(d) _Notice of Claims_. The Indemnified Partys failure to give reasonably
prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any actual, threatened or
possible claim or demand that may give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party unless the failure to
give such written notice materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

 

8.4. _Survival; Fraud_. The representations and warranties of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, subject to the time
limits on claims as provided in Section 8.2(b), and shall not be extinguished
by the Closing. The representations and warranties of Company and the
Stockholder contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, subject to
the time limits on claims as provided in Section 8.1(b), and shall not be
extinguished by the Closing. None of the covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing,
and no party shall have any liability after the Closing for any breach
thereof. None of the limitations contained in this ARTICLE VIII shall apply to
Fraud.

 

8.5. _Payments; Order of Recovery; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, then subject to Section 8.5(b),
the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business
Days of such agreement or final adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 

(b) Any and all indemnification payments required pursuant to Section 8.1(a)
shall be paid in the following sequence and order of priority:

(i) with respect to Losses under Section 8.1(a)(i) or 8.1(a)(iii), first, from
that portion of the General Escrow Fund in an amount not to exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (until that portion of the General Escrow Fund has
been fully depleted), and second, from the RandW Policy;

 

(ii) with respect to Losses under Section 8.1(a)(viii), first, from that
portion of the General Escrow Fund in an amount not to exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (until that portion of the General Escrow Fund has been fully
depleted), second, from the RandW Policy (to the extent covered under the RandW
Policy), and third, from the Stockholder directly;

 

(iii) with respect to Losses under Section 8.1(a)(ii), first, from that
portion of the General Escrow Fund in an amount not to exceed the

 



55

    

 Indemnity Escrow Amount (until that portion of the General Escrow Fund has
been fully depleted), and second, from the Stockholder directly;

 

(iv) with respect to Losses under Sections 8.1(a)(iv), 8.1(a)(v), 8.1(a)(vi),
or 8.1(a)(vii), first, from the Special Escrow Fund (until the Special Escrow
Fund has been fully depleted), and second, from the Stockholder directly.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prevent the Purchaser
from recovering, or limit the Purchasers ability to recover, under the RandW
Policy in accordance with its terms, including, without limitation, any
recovery for Fraud.

 

(d) The indemnification rights provided in this ARTICLE VIII constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties following Closing with respect to
any breach of, or dispute arising out of or related to, this Agreement, other
than (i) claims based on Fraud, (ii) the remedy of specific performance
provided by Section 9.15 and other equitable remedies, (iii) as provided by
Section 1.3 with respect to the Adjustment Amount, or (iv) as provided by
Section 1.4 with respect to the Earnout Payment. No Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one
provision of this Agreement to the extent that any Indemnified Party had
already recovered the same Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to
other provisions of this Agreement.

 

8.6. _Limitations_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a
Purchaser Indemnified Party will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.1(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate of all the amounts due to
the Purchaser Group under Section 8.1(a)(i) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "
_Basket_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Party will be entitled to
recover Losses only to the extent such Losses exceed the Basket, up to the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "); _provided, however_ , that any
Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any of the
following shall not be subject to the Basket: (i) the Companys or the
Stockholders breach of, or any inaccuracy contained in, the Fundamental
Representations or (ii) Fraud on the part of the Stockholder or the Company.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Basket and the Cap do not apply to claims
for indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.1(a)(ii) and 8.1(a)(iv) through
8.1(a)(viii) and the Basket does not apply to claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii); provided, that the Stockholder shall not be
required to provide indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.1(a)(iv),
8.1(a)(v), 8.1(a)(vi) or 8.1(a)(vii) once the aggregate of all amounts due to
the Purchaser Group under Sections 8.1(a)(iv), 8.1(a)(v), 8.1(a)(vi) and
8.1(a)(vii) exceeds $27,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in Section
8.6(c) (the " _Special Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, except in connection with Fraud on the part of the Stockholder
or the Company, in no event shall the Stockholder be required to provide
indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII for any Losses in excess of the
Purchase Price. The limitations contained in this ARTICLE VIII shall in no
way limit the amounts Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover under the RandW
Policy.

 



56

    

(c) The Special Cap shall be subject to reduction at the following times and
in the following amounts:

(i) upon the settlement or other final, non-appealable Order resolving in
full the IRS Audit, the Special Cap shall be reduced by (A) $10,000,000, if
such settlement or Order results in a Liability of the Company to the IRS of
$2,000,000 or less; or (B) $5,000,000, if such settlement or Order results in
a Liability of the Company to the IRS of more than $2,000,000 but equal to or
less than $4,000,000; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Special
Cap shall not be reduced under this 8.6(c)(i) if such settlement or Order
results in a Liability of the Company to the IRS of more than $4,000,000;

(ii) if the Stockholder has not received (1) notice of an audit (or any
notice of any potential audit or other request for information, in each case
that tolls the applicable statute of limitations) from the IRS that would give
rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(v), or (2) notice
from the Purchaser in accordance with Section 8.3 of a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(v), (A) by May 15, 2020, with respect to
an audit of fiscal year 2016, the Special Cap shall be reduced by
$500,000; (B) by May 15, 2021, with respect to an audit of fiscal year 2017,
the Special Cap shall be reduced by $1,500,000; (C) by May 15, 2022, with
respect to an audit of fiscal year 2018, the Special Cap shall be reduced by
$1,500,000; or (D) by May 15, 2023, with respect to an audit of fiscal year
2019, the Special Cap shall be reduced by $1,500,000; provided, that each such
Special Cap reduction shall occur prior to such specified date upon an earlier
settlement or other final, non-appealable Order that resolves or otherwise
agrees not to conduct any such audit; provided further, that if the Special
Cap reduction under Section 8.6(c)(i) is less than $10,000,000, then
the difference between $10,000,000 and such Special Cap reduction shall be
applied to increase the potential Special Cap reduction under clause (D) above
(for purposes of example only, if the Special Cap reduction under Section
8.6(c)(i) is $5,000,000, then the potential Special Cap reduction under
clause (D) shall instead equal $6,500,000), and provided, further, that if
Stockholder has received such notice from the IRS or Purchaser as set forth in
either clause (1) or (2) immediately above for any fiscal years, the Special
Cap reduction applicable to the fiscal years to which such audit or claim
applies shall not occur until the settlement or other final, non-appealable
Order that resolves such pending claims or audits, and if such audits or
claims have not been resolved by May 15, 2023, the Special Cap reduction under
clause (D) above shall not occur until the settlement or other final, non-
appealable Order that resolves such pending claims or audits; and

(iii) upon (A) the grant of the Companys motion for judgment on the
pleadings in the matter set forth on Schedule 8.1(a)(vii), the Special Cap
shall be reduced by $2,000,000; or (B) the settlement or other final non-
appealable Order resolving the matter set forth on Schedule 8.1(a)(vii),
including pursuant to the terms of that certain Memorandum of Understanding
dated

  



57

    

 April 16, 2019, the Special Cap shall be reduced by $12,000,000 (net of any
previous reduction in the Special Cap pursuant to clause (A)).

 

(d) If, at any time, the Special Cap has been reduced, as provided by Section
8.6(c), to an amount below the amount then-remaining in the Special Escrow
Fund, the Stockholder and Purchaser shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to release to the Stockholder an amount equal to the
Special Escrow Fund _minus_ the now-reduced Special Cap, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the parties shall be liable to the other, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise, for any punitive or exemplary or other similar type of damages
whatsoever, that in any way arise out of, or relate to, or are a consequence
of, its performance or nonperformance under the Acquisition Documents, except
to the extent to which a Third-Party Claim indemnified under this ARTICLE VIII
includes such damages.

 

(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any Losses to the extent such Losses are reflected in the Adjustment Amount.

(g) The parties specifically and unambiguously intend that the survival
periods that are set forth in this ARTICLE VIII for the representations and
warranties contained herein will replace any statute of limitations for such
representations or warranties that would otherwise be applicable (including,
without limitation, the statute of limitations prescribed by the law of the
State of Delaware).

8.7. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses indemnifiable under this ARTICLE VIII.

 

8.8. _Effect of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree to treat all payments
made under the provisions of this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes.

8.9. _Materiality; Subrogation_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party
shall be calculated after giving effect to any amounts, including insurance
proceeds, actually received by an Indemnified Party (or any of its affiliates)
from any Third Party and any Tax benefit actually realized by any Indemnified
Party or any of its affiliates specifically as a result of such Losses. A net
Tax benefit is "actually realized" to the extent that, and at such time as,
the amount of Taxes required to be paid by the Indemnified Party is reduced
below the amount of Taxes that it would have been required to pay but for
deductibility of such Losses, in each case: (i) during the same or next
consecutive Tax year as the year in which the relevant Losses occurred; (ii)
calculated so that the items related to the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations are the last to be recognized; and (iii) as
reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and
recoveries (other than escrowed amounts held pursuant to that certain Escrow
Agreement, dated May 22, 2015, by and between the Company, Jennifer Fuicelli
and

 



58

    

 Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as amended). Any indemnification
payments for Losses to be made under this Article VIII shall initially be made
without regard to this Section 8.9(a) and shall be reduced to reflect any
such net Tax benefit only after the Indemnified Party has actually realized
such benefit. If any such benefits or recoveries are received by an
Indemnified Party (or any of its affiliates) with respect to any Losses after
an Indemnifying Party has made an indemnity payment to the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Losses, the Indemnified Party (or such affiliate) shall
reimburse the Indemnifying Party the amount of such benefits or recoveries,
net of Taxes (up to the amount of the Indemnifying Partys indemnity
payment). Losses shall not be reduced by (i) any retentions or deductibles
paid by the Indemnified Party (or any of its affiliates) under any other
insurance policies; (ii) any increase in premium under such policies
attributable to the Loss giving rise to such offsetting recoveries; or (iii)
any costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (or any of its
affiliates) in connection with the recovery of such offsetting recoveries.

(b) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred by a party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising out of or resulting from any breach
of a representation or warranty contained herein and for purposes of
determining the existence of a breach, references to Material Adverse Effect
or materiality (or other similar terms) shall be disregarded.

(c) Upon making of any payment to the Purchaser Group in respect of any Losses
incurred in connection with the IRS Audit, the Stockholder shall, to the
extent of such payment, be fully subrogated to all rights of the Purchaser
Group, against any Third Party in respect of any Losses to which the payment
relates. The Purchaser Group and the Stockholder will execute upon request
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights. If the Stockholder, as the Indemnifying Party, receives
payment of any amounts pursuant to this Section 8.9(c) in connection with the
IRS Audit, then the Stockholder shall deposit such amount into the Special
Escrow Fund to the extent such amount was paid out of the Special Escrow Fund
in connection with the IRS Audit. Except as set forth in the foregoing
sentences, the Indemnifying Party shall not be subrogated to any rights of
the Indemnified Party (and its affiliates) against any Third Party in respect
of any Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1.  _Release_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Stockholder, on behalf of itself, its
present and future affiliates, equity holders, predecessors, successors and
assigns and their respective heirs, assigns and representatives, and any
Person claiming by, through or under any of the foregoing, hereby releases,
remises, acquits and forever discharges Purchaser, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and all of their respective past and present
officers, directors, managers, stockholders, members, employees, agents,
predecessors, subsidiaries, affiliates, estates, successors, assigns, partners
and attorneys (each, a " _Released Party_ " and collectively, the " _Released
Parties_ ") to the maximum extent permitted by Law, from any and all
complaints, claims, charges, actions, causes of action, sums of money due,
suits, debts, covenants, contracts, agreements, rights, damages, promises,
demands or liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever,

 



59

    

 in law or in equity, whether based in contract, tort (including fraud),
statute or otherwise, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that
the Stockholder or any of its present and future affiliates, equity holders,
predecessors, successors and assigns and their respective heirs, assigns and
representatives, individually or as a member of any class, now has, owns or
holds or has at any time heretofore ever had, owned or held, or may in the
future have, own or hold (collectively, " _Claims_ ") against Purchaser, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Released Parties,
arising at or prior to the Closing, or related to any act, omission or event
occurring, or condition existing, at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this release shall not act in any manner to waive or release
any future Claims against the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
arising out of this Agreement or the other Acquisition Documents. The
Stockholder further represents and covenants that it has not, and following
the Closing will not, file or institute any Claim (or participate, cooperate,
encourage, assist, or solicit any Third Party in connection with such Claim)
against Purchaser, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Released Parties with respect to the Claims released in this Agreement.

 

(b) It is the Stockholders intention that Section 9.1(a) shall be effective
as a full and final accord and satisfactory release of each and every matter
specifically or generally referred to in such Section. The Stockholder
acknowledges that it is aware that it may hereafter discover claims or facts
in addition or different from those it now knows or believes to be true
with respect to the claims released in Section 9.1(a). Nevertheless, it is
the intention of the Stockholder to fully, finally and forever settle and
release all such claims, and all claims relative thereto, which do now exist,
may exist, or heretofore have existed. In furtherance of such intention,
Section 9.1(a) shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete general
release of all such matters, notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any
additional or different claims or facts relative thereto. The Stockholder
acknowledges that the applicable laws of many states provide substantially the
following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." The Stockholder acknowledges
that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving
claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, the
Stockholder agrees that, effective as of the Closing, it shall be deemed to
waive any such provision.

 

9.2. _Definitions_.

As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

" _affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, a Person that directly or
indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with, the first mentioned Person, where "control"
(including the terms "controlled by" and "under common control with") means
the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of stock or other securities, as trustee or executor, by contract
or otherwise.

 



60

    

" _Acquisition Documents_ " means this Agreement and the other documents
and instruments to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

" _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ " means $1,000,000.

 

" _Business Day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or day on which
banks are permitted or obligated to close in the State of California.

" _Cash_ " means, without duplication, the total amount of cash and cash
equivalents that would be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of a
Person prepared in accordance with GAAP, which, for the avoidance of doubt,
(i) shall be calculated net of issued and uncleared checks, wire transfers and
drafts, and (ii) shall include credit card receipts in transit and any cash,
checks, wire transfers and drafts subject to deposits in transit or available
for deposit for the account of such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing definition shall be applied so that Cash resulting from the
collection of receivables or other assets is recognized at the same time that
the reduction in such receivable or other asset by reason of such collection
is recognized, and that the reduction in Cash expended to pay payables
and other liabilities or to acquire an asset is recognized at the same time
as the reduction in payables or other liabilities or the creation of such
asset by reason of such expenditure is recognized.

 

" _Cause_ " means, with respect to Jennifer Fuicelli (" _Fuicelli_ "), (i)
Fuicellis material failure to perform her duties for the Purchaser (or its
affiliates, including the Company or any Company Subsidiary after Closing)
(other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or
mental illness), which failure is not cured within five (5) Business Days
after a written notification is delivered to Fuicelli by Purchaser or the
Company that specifically identifies the manner in which Purchaser or the
Company believes that Fuicelli has materially failed to perform her duties
and Purchasers or Companys clear expectations for cure; (ii) Fuicellis
material failure to comply with any valid and legal directive of the Board of
Directors of the Purchaser (or its affiliates, including the Company or any
Company Subsidiary after Closing) or any Person to whom Fuicelli reports or
by whom Fuicelli is managed, which failure is not cured within five (5)

"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
followed by the words "without limitation." The word "herein" and similar
references mean, except where a specific Section or Article reference is
expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than any specific Section or
Article. As used herein, all pronouns shall include the masculine, feminine,
neuter, singular and plural thereof whenever the context and facts require
such construction.

 

9.17. _Waiver of Conflict; Disposition of Attorney-Client Privilege_. In any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the
Stockholder shall have the right, at its election, to retain the firm of
Alston and Bird LLP to represent it in such matter, and Purchaser, for itself
and for its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives, and shall
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to waive, any objection and
consent to any such representation in any such matter. Purchaser acknowledges
that the foregoing provision shall apply regardless of whether Alston and Bird
LLP provides legal services to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries after
the Closing. If the Transactions are consummated, any of the Companys records
related to the Transactions protected by attorney-client privilege will become
property of (and be controlled by) the Stockholder, and Purchaser hereby
irrevocably disclaims the right to assert a waiver by the Stockholder with
regard to the attorney-client privilege solely

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and any one of which may be
delivered by facsimile or as attachments to email.
