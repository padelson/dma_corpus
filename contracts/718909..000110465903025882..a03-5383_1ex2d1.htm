AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 12, 2003 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among General Electric Company, a New York corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Patriot HFS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and HPSC, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ " and, together with Merger Sub, the " _Constituent
Corporations_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have each determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and such Boards of Directors have approved such
Merger pursuant to which each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.3), other than shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Parent or
directly by the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.8(c));

  



  

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "); and the parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a
plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into Voting Agreements,
dated as of the date hereof and the form of which is attached as Exhibit A
hereto (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the stockholders party
thereto (the " _Stockholders_ ") have agreed, among other things, to vote all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Voting Agreement in favor of
the Merger and this Agreement and against any Takeover Proposal (as defined
herein), subject to and on the conditions set forth therein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  

      
   



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  

# ** **

  

# **THE MERGER**

  

# ** **

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue its corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date), unless another
time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (any such date,
the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Gibson,
Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York, unless another
place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing,
the parties shall (i) file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of, the DGCL, and (ii) make all other filings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Constituent
Corporations shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Constituent Corporations shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Charter_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall upon the Effective Time
and by virtue of the Merger be amended to read in its entirety as set forth
in Exhibit 1.5, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.

  



  

Section 1.6 _By-Laws_. The by-laws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall upon the Effective Time be
amended to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit 1.6, and as so
amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Except as
set forth on Section 1.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the officers of
the Company immediately

  



  

2      
   



  

prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified
or their earlier resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an
officer, as the case may be. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each of the directors of the Company to tender his or
her resignation as a director of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which such resignations shall become effective at and as of
the Effective Time. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director, as the case may
be.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

  



  

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the
Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.4 hereof, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.8(b)) shall
be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of voting
common stock, par value $0.16 per share, of Parent (" _GE Common Stock_
") determined by dividing $14.50 by the Average GE Share Price (as defined
below) and rounding the result to the nearest one thousandth of a share (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if between the
first day of the Valuation Period (as defined below) and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of GE Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares. The " _Average GE Share Price_ " means the average of
the daily volume-weighted sales prices per share of GE Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") Tape for each of the 10 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day which is three calendar days prior to
the Closing Date, or, if such ending date does not fall on a trading day,
then the trading day immediately preceding the third calendar day prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Valuation Period_ "). All such shares of Company
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive certificates representing the shares of
GE Common Stock into which such shares are converted, any cash, without
interest, in lieu of fractional shares to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, and any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.3.

  



  

3      
   



  

Section 1.9 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding employee
or other stock option and each then outstanding director stock option (each,
an " _Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be (or, if
not previously vested and exercisable, shall become) vested and exercisable
and such Options immediately thereafter shall be canceled by the Company, and
each holder of a canceled Option shall be entitled to receive at the
Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Company in
consideration for the cancellation of such Option the number of shares of GE
Common Stock (each a " _Substitute Share_ "), in an amount equal to:

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restrictions on all
outstanding shares of restricted Company Common Stock granted to employees or
directors shall lapse, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 1.8(c).

  



  

(c) The Company shall (i) take all actions necessary and appropriate so that
all stock or other equity based plans maintained with respect to the Company
Common Stock, including the stock or other equity based plans listed
on Section 3.1(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _Option Plans_
"), shall terminate as of the Effective Time, (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to provide that any other Benefit Plan providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be amended to
provide that no further issuances, transfers or grants shall be permitted
from and after the Effective Time, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts
to provide that, from and after the Effective Time, no holder of an Option or
any participant in any Option Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(x) obtain all necessary consents from, and provide (in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent) any required notices to, holders of Options, and (y)
amend the terms of the applicable Option Plan, in each case, as is necessary
to give effect to the provision of this Section 1.9.

# **ARTICLE II**

  

# ** **

  

# **EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

# ** **

  

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Certificates_. Parent shall authorize a bank, trust
company, or such other person or persons as shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company, to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ").  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock converted in the Merger, certificates representing the
shares of GE Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8(c) in exchange
for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and cash, as required to make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4 (such cash
and shares of GE Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the GE Common Stock contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.8(c) out of the Exchange Fund. Except
as contemplated by Section 1.8, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock converted in the
Merger (the " _Certificates_ ") a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
shares of GE Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares).  Upon
surrender for cancellation to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate held by any
record holder of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of shares of GE
Common Stock into which the shares represented by the surrendered Certificate
shall have been converted at the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II,
cash in lieu of any fractional share in accordance with Section 2.4 and
certain dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.3, and
any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholding_. No dividends or
other distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on GE
Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after
the Effective Time, will be paid to any person entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive a certificate representing GE Common Stock until such
person surrenders the related Certificate or Certificates, as provided in
Section 2.2, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to
any such person pursuant to Section 1.8. Subject to the effect of applicable
law, there shall be paid to each record holder of a new certificate
representing such GE Common Stock: (a) at the time of such surrender or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of GE Common Stock
represented by such new certificate and having a record date on or after the
Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender; (b) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount
of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares
of GE Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or

  



  

5      
   



  

subsequent to such surrender; and (c) at the time of such surrender or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any cash payable with
respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.8. In no event shall the person entitled to
receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest
on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or certificate
representing shares of GE Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance
of certificates for such shares of GE Common Stock in a name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  



  

Section 2.4 _No Fractional Securities_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of GE Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Article II, and no
Parent dividend or other distribution or stock split shall relate to any
fractional share, and no fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any
such fractional share, each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of GE Common Stock upon
surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article II will be
paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying (a) the Average GE Share Price by (b) the
fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent
shall so notify the Parent, and the Parent shall deposit such amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.3 and this Section 2.4.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of
Parent, and any such former stockholders who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
their claim for GE Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to GE
Common Stock.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any such shares of GE Common
Stock and dividends and distributions held in the Exchange Fund which is
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  



  

6      
   



  

Section 2.6 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares
of GE Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.3 and 2.4) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or the Parent, such Certificates
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of GE Common Stock any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either
of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and
directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and
on behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things
as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the
Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

law).

  



  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or constitute a
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or require

to: (A) any provision of the charter, articles or certificate of

9      
   



  

any Subsidiary of the Company, or (B) except as could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to
in paragraph (iii) below, any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage,
bond, indenture, Securitization Transaction Document, lease, benefit plan or
other agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or
license, or any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation, including the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, any other applicable federal credit laws, and
the Federal Healthcare Program Anti-Kickback provisions of the U.S. Social
Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b), as any such laws or regulations may be
hereinafter amended (" _Laws_ "), applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company or their respective properties or assets.

  



  

(iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Person or the United States government or any
United States domestic state, municipal or local government, any
instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency or commission or
other authority thereof, or any United States domestic quasi-governmental or
private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or other United
States domestic governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), is required by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

the Certificate of Merger, (D) the Required Company Vote, (E) the rules and
regulations of the American Stock Exchange (the " _AMEX_ "), (F) such
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings the failure of which to make or obtain could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company and (G) Section 5.10 of this Agreement.  Consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required
under or in relation to any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are
hereinafter referred to as " _Required Consents_."

  



  

(d) _Reports and Financial Statements_. The Company has filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (collectively, including all exhibits
thereto, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). No Subsidiary of the Company is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC. None of the
Company SEC Reports filed as of their respective dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing, then as of the date of such filing), as so
amended or superseded, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading or failed to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, the Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.  Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports presents
fairly, in all

  



  

10      
   



  

material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries as

otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments.

  



  

(e) _Liabilities_. Except for liabilities (i) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice (other than indebtedness for
borrowed money or other material financing transactions) and that could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (ii) disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, since the date of the most recent audited annual financial
statements included in the Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Audited Financials_ "), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
that could reasonably be required to be reflected or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied in preparing the fiscal year end
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries contained
in the Filed Audited Financials.

other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of,

which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, (C)(1) granted any severance or termination payment, (2) entered
into any employment, deferred compensation, consulting, severance,
indemnification, change in control, retention or other similar agreement or
arrangement, (3) increased any compensation or benefits payable or to become
payable under any existing severance or termination pay policy or employment,
deferred compensation, stock loan, consulting, severance, change in control,
retention or other similar agreement or arrangement, or (4) increased the
compensation, bonus, incentive or other benefits payable to (or to become
payable to) former or current directors, officers, employees or consultants
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than an increase in annual
salary or hourly wage rates granted to current employees (other than
officers) in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice,
(D) made or agreed to make any increase in any Company Plan or adopt a new
employee benefit plan, which in either case could result in an increase in
liability to the Company, (E) other than in

  



  

11      
   



  

the ordinary course of business, sold or transferred any of the assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or (F) made any capital expenditures in respect
of its business or operations (excluding capital expenditures made in respect
of portfolio or other properties held or controlled in the course of its
business) in excess of $300,000 in the aggregate.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not agreed or committed (directly or indirectly) to do any
of the foregoing.

  



  

(g) _Information Supplied_. None of the information to be supplied in
writing by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
registration statement on Form S-4 (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ ") and the proxy
statement/prospectus included therein (together with any amendments
or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") will (A) in the case of the
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (B) in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting and
at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply
(with respect to the Company) as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Securities Act, and the Proxy Statement will comply (with
respect to the Company) as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.1(g), no representation or warranty is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement based on information supplied in
writing by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) recommended that the
stockholders of the Company approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iv) authorized the preparation, filing and delivery

to render inapplicable to the Merger and this Agreement (and the

defined in Title XV, Chapter 110C, 1 of the General Laws of Massachusetts)
set forth in Chapter 110, Section C of the General Laws of Massachusetts and
the limitations on the voting rights of shares of stock acquired in
a "control share acquisition" (as defined in Chapter 110E, 1(c)(1) of
the General Laws of Massachusetts) set forth in Title XV, Chapter
110, Sections D and E of the General Laws of Massachusetts, and as of the

regulation applies to the Merger and this Agreement (and the transactions
provided for herein).

  



  

(i) _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote (the "
_Required Company Vote_ ")

is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company capital
stock necessary to approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including the amendment to the Companys charter contemplated hereby.

Section 5.3 _All Reasonable Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and

efforts (or best efforts with respect to the covenant in Section 5.10) (i) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, to consummate the Merger as
promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other

Filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR
Act. Each party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary
to assist the other party in the preparation of its HSR Filing, to request
early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act and, if
requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder.
 Parent and the Company shall furnish to each other all such information as

any order or decree, or defend against any such actions or proceedings
commenced by any Governmental Entity in respect of the antitrust,
competition, merger control or similar laws and rules or regulations, and

obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to
enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any

Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parents or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to retain, the Company or any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or (B) the ability to
retain, own or operate any portion of the businesses, product lines, or

thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, then such party
will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as possible
and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. Parent and the Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of any
material communication from the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the
Merger.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to

failure to act would cause, or be reasonably likely to cause, the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

to, any Takeover Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions regarding,
or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal;

prohibit the Company or its directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange
offer, provided that the Company may not take any position or action, except
as permitted by Section 5.1(b), other than recommending rejection of any such
tender or exchange offer without first complying in all respects with the
provisions of this Agreement regarding acceptance of a Superior Proposal,
including the following proviso; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to
the Effective Time and following the receipt of a Takeover Proposal that was
made in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after

constitute a breach by it of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under
applicable law, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal and
subject to compliance with Section 5.4(b), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the party making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement (but no less favorable to the Company
than the confidentiality agreement entered into with Parent), _provided_
that (A) such confidentiality agreement must include a provision
prohibiting solicitation of key employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
such provision lasting at least one year, and may not include any provision

bona fide Takeover Proposal from a third party which is a Superior Proposal,
enter into an agreement with such third party and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) hereof, if after duly considering the advice
of outside counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith that failure to do so could reasonably be expected to breach
its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law.

  



  

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph (a)
of this Section 5.4, and subject to the terms of any
confidentiality agreement signed prior to the date hereof, the Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing, and in no event later than 48
hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry, or other contact is
received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company in
respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent,
indicate the identity of the person making such proposal, offer, inquiry, or
other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or the
nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals or offers or the status
of any

such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall not release any person
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
entered into as of the date of this Agreement.

the Company determine in their good faith and reasonable judgment after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel to be more
favorable from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account
at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that

cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director and officer of the Company and other persons entitled
to indemnification under the charter and by-laws or similar
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date hereof (" _Covered Persons_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") reasonably
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, " _Covered Claims_ "), including any
Covered Claims arising out of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted

  



  

37      
   



  

under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall be deemed
to have satisfied its obligations hereunder if it has paid all applicable
amounts into escrow within thirty days after a written claim for
indemnification by the Covered Person has been received by the Parent. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if required under applicable Law, the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is

Each Covered Person will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
from the Covered Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to
the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be required to indemnify a
Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by
such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part
thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the Board of Directors of
Parent, unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was commenced by a Covered
Person with respect to amounts paid into escrow pursuant to this Section
5.7(a) that have not been released to such Covered Person within a reasonable
period after it has been ultimately determined that such Covered Person is
entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and all other Subsidiaries
of the Company to maintain for a period of at least six years the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts provided by reputable and financially sound insurance companies
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay premiums
therefor in any one year in an amount in excess of 200% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Closing for purposes of this Section 5.7, which policies provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of not less than
six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Closing, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the Companys obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,

  



  

38      
   



  

and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
such Subsidiary or such successor or assign assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.7.

  



  

(d) This Section 5.7 is intended to benefit and shall be enforceable by the
Covered Persons and their respective heirs, executors and personal
representatives and shall be binding on and enforceable against Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party
shall use all reasonable efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (ii) unless
otherwise required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Rule 145 Letters_. On the date hereof, the Company shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to
counsel for Parent) identifying all persons who, at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company as that
term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
(the " _Rule 145 Affiliates_"). The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate
in such list to deliver to Parent within 30 days of the date hereof a
written agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 5.9 hereto, executed
by each of such persons identified in the foregoing list.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Consents, Waivers and Other Approvals_. The Company and any
applicable Subsidiary shall use best efforts to obtain all consents, waivers
and other approvals necessary in order to avoid the occurrence, as a result
of the Merger, of (i) any Violation (as defined in Section 3.1(c)(ii) of this
Agreement) under any agreement listed in Section 5.10 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or under any other agreement material to the Company or
any Subsidiary, including any "wind-down event," "event of termination" or
other event giving rise to a termination under any Securitization
Transaction Document or (ii) any "servicing termination event" or other
similar termination or replacement of the Company or any Subsidiary as
"servicer" under any Securitization Transaction Document.  For the avoidance
of doubt, solely for purposes of Section 5.10(i) hereof, an agreement shall
be considered "material" to the Company or applicable Subsidiary if (x) the
Merger would cause, result in, or otherwise give rise to a Violation under
such agreement, and (y) as a consequence of such Violation and the exercise
(or right to exercise) any rights or remedies under such agreement, a cross-
default or other event of default or termination would occur (or could occur
with notice, or the passage of time) under any agreement listed in Section
5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange Listings_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to list on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of
GE Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger which have not
been previously listed.

Section 5.12 _Employee Wages and Benefits_. For the first year following the
Effective Time while employed by the Surviving Corporation, employees of the
Surviving Corporation will receive base wages and salaries at rates no less
favorable to such employees than the rates of base wages and salaries paid by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to such employees on the date of this
Agreement (excluding bonuses and other variable pay). Except with respect to
the Executives or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain in effect current
Company employee benefit plans and arrangements at least through the end of
the calendar month in which the Merger becomes effective, and (ii) beginning
on the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which
the Merger becomes effective, through December 31, 2004, maintain in effect
employee benefit plans and arrangements which provide benefits which have a
value which is substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits
provided by the Company. For purposes of determining eligibility
to participate or entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time shall receive service credit for service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such credit was granted under the
Company Plans, subject to offsets for previously accrued benefits and no
duplication of benefits. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-
of-pocket limitations payable during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, current employees of the Company during such plan year under similar
plans maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(a) In connection with each Company Sponsored Asset Securitization
Transaction prior to the date hereof under which the Company had the ability
to elect to sell financial assets either with or without an option to
repurchase, the Company shall execute and deliver to the purchaser of such
assets documents identifying those assets sold with such a repurchase option

Transaction after the date hereof under which the Company has the ability to
elect to sell financial assets either with or without an option to

assets at or before the closing of such sale a document identifying
those assets being sold with a repurchase option and those being sold without
such an option.
