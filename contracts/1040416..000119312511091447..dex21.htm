The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way
of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may
have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the
Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of, or other
investors in, the Company. The Companys stockholders and other investors are
not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely
on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof
as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates.  _TABLE OF CONTENTS_

3 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 5,
2011, among Merck and Co., Inc., a company formed under the laws of New Jersey
(" _Parent_ "), Monarch Transaction Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Inspire
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set
forth in Exhibit A attached hereto.

Recitals

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Transactions, (a) Parent has agreed to cause
Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the
issued and outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") of the Company and the associated preferred
stock purchase rights (the " _Rights_ ", and together with the Company Common
Stock, each a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") at a price per
Share of $5.00 net to the seller in cash, without interest (such amount, or
any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and (b) the Company has granted to Merger Sub
the Top-Up Option;

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Each Share that is
not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as
provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and
converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to
enter into this Agreement, (i) the Companys Board of Directors has approved,
and the Company and the Rights Agent have entered into, the Rights Amendment
and (ii) a shareholder of the Company is entering into a Tender and Support
Agreement with Parent (the " _Tender and Support Agreement_ "), whereby such
shareholder has agreed, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in
the Offer and support any and all corporate action necessary to consummate
the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



1 ARTICLE 1.

THE OFFER

_Section 1.1._ _The Offer._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and
all outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price. The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase,
accept for payment, and pay for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set
forth in Annex A (the " _Offer Conditions_ ").

(b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Exchange Act Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2) (such date being the initial "
_Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date established pursuant to
an authorized extension of the Offer as so extended, also an " _Expiration
Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the initial Expiration Date or
any subsequent Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived (other than any Offer Conditions that by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the closing of the Offer, which shall be required to
be satisfied or waived at the closing of the Offer), then Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, subject to the rights of the parties
under Article 8, extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its Expiration Date
beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent Expiration Date until
the date all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived (other than any
Offer Conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the closing of
the Offer, which shall be required to be satisfied or waived at the closing of
the Offer); _provided_ that any such extension (i) shall be in increments
determined by Merger Sub of not more than ten (10) Business Days and (ii)
shall not extend beyond the Walk Away Date. The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its Expiration Date (as such Expiration Date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Article 8. In no event shall Merger Sub extend
the Offer beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Walk
Away Date without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole
discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the rights of the
parties under Article 8, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to extend the Offer, for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or any period required by any other Law.

 

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, comply with the obligations respecting prompt
payment and announcement under the Exchange Act, and, without limiting the
foregoing, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable following the later of: (i)
the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the

 



2  Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions
shall have been satisfied or waived.

(d) Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without any required consent
of the Company, but subject to the terms set forth in this Section 1.1(d)),
elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions
thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a "
_Subsequent Offering Period_ ") following the Acceptance Time if (i) Merger
Sub shall have complied with all of the conditions of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act and (ii) at the commencement of any Subsequent Offering Period
(or extension thereof) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries (including any Shares beneficially owned by any
of the foregoing and including all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn at the Acceptance Time) represent less than 90% of the then
outstanding number of Shares; provided, however, that if Merger Sub
is required to exercise the Top-Up Option pursuant to Section 1.4(c), Merger
Sub shall not be permitted to provide for a Subsequent Offering Period. If
immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries own more than 70% but less than 90% of the Shares
outstanding at that time (which shall include (i) shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, which Shares shall be
converted into direct ownership at or prior to the expiration of the Offer by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and
(ii) shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn at the
Acceptance Time), to the extent requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall
provide for, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to provide for, a Subsequent
Offering Period of ten (10) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Merger Sub is required to exercise the Top-Up Option pursuant to Section
1.4(c), the Company shall not have the right to request a Subsequent Offering
Period; _provided_ , _further_ that the Company shall not have the right to
request a Subsequent Offering Period if such Subsequent Offering Period would
extend beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Walk Away
Date without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be
withheld in its sole discretion). Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as
promptly as practicable after any such Shares are tendered during any
Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

(vi) impose any condition to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions; or

 

(vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or
impair the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or the other Transactions.

(f) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall (i) contain or incorporate by
reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary

satisfactory to the Company. The Company shall as promptly as practicable upon

such that the Offer Documents do not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Offer Documents each time before they are filed with the
SEC and/or disseminated to holders of Shares (and the Company and its counsel
shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company and its counsel). Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide to the Company and its counsel copies of any written comments or
telephonic notification of any oral comments or other communications Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the

 



4  receipt of such comments or other communications, shall consult with the
Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments or other
communications, and shall provide the Company with copies of all written
responses and telephonic notification of any oral responses thereto of Parent
or Merger Sub or their counsel, _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to any such comments or other
communications and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable
and good faith consideration shall be given by Parent and Merger Sub).

 

(g) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer without the prior
written consent of the Company in its sole discretion, except that in the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Merger Sub shall
promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) following
such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated in
accordance with this Agreement prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer,
Merger Sub shall promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the tendering stockholders.

 

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock effected by the Company in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the payment by
Merger Sub for the Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in
connection with the Offer. 

_Section 1.2._ _Company Actions_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.8, and without limitation of the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the Company hereby approves of and

disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer, to the extent
required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable Laws, to the holders of the Shares concurrently with the mailing of
the Offer Documents. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.8 below, the
Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the Board Recommendation,
and the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
such recommendation. The Company shall, after receiving the written consent
of its financial advisor, also include in the Schedule 14D-9 (or in an Annex
thereto), in its entirety, a copy of the opinion of the Company Financial
Advisor described in Section 3.16. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities
Laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, shall not contain any
untrue statement of

 



5  a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the
Company makes no covenant, agreement, representation or warranty with respect
to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent necessary such that the Schedule 14D-9 does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws.

 

(c) Except in connection with either (i) a Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial
advisor(s)) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
or (ii) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 6.8:

(A) Parent and its counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares; and

staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments or other communications, shall consult with Parent and its counsel
prior to responding to any such comments or other communications, and shall
provide Parent with copies of all written responses and telephonic
notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company and its counsel.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the response of the Company to any such comments or other communications
and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given by the Company).

(d) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall instruct
its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
most recent practicable date and of those Persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of all available lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Shares, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information
and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request, in each case,
for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares. Subject
to the requirements of applicable Law and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
Parent and Merger Sub shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in
confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists
in accordance with the Confidentiality

 



6  Agreement, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1, shall deliver to the Company or destroy, at
Parents election, all copies of such information then in their possession or
under their control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 _Section 1.3._ _Directors_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and applicable marketplace rules of The NASDAQ
Stock Market LLC applicable to the Company at such time, promptly following
the acceptance for payment of and payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant
to and in accordance with the Offer satisfying the Minimum Tender Condition
(the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and as long as Parent directly or indirectly
beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding
Shares, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on
the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board
equal to that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that
is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied
by (ii) the percentage that (A) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of Shares
that are issued and outstanding. The Company shall also, upon the request of
Parent, cause such persons designated by Merger Sub to constitute at least the
same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company
Board of each committee of the Company Board, subject to compliance with
applicable securities Laws and the marketplace rules of The NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC (other than any committee comprised solely of Continuing Directors
established to take action under this Agreement, which shall be permitted to
meet without the presence of other directors solely for purposes of
considering and, if necessary, taking action referred to in Section 1.3(c)
below); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs designees
are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the
date of this Agreement and who qualify as independent directors for purposes
of the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the
SEC rules and regulations (such directors, the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
and _provided further_ that, in such event, if the number of Continuing
Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the
Company Board shall cause the Person(s) designated by the
remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies), and such
person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of
the Company then in office shall designate two (2) persons to fill such
vacancies who are not officers, employees, stockholders or Affiliates of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall either increase
the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its
current directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees
to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above, and the
Company shall take all actions available to the Company to cause Merger Subs
designees to be so elected or appointed (the date on which the majority of
the Companys directors are designees of Merger Sub that have been
effectively appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the "
_Board Appointment Date_ "). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
from and after the Acceptance Time and for so long as Parent, Merger Sub and
any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub (excluding the Company) own at least a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the

 



7  Company Common Stock, the Company shall be a "controlled company" (within
the meaning of the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market).

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees of Merger Sub to the
Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-l promulgated thereunder and to the then applicable rules and regulations
of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The Company, at its expense, shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to the
Companys stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9, as
contemplated by Section 1.2(b)) as is necessary to fulfill the Companys
obligations under Section 1.3(a); _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall have timely supplied to the Company in writing, and shall be
solely responsible for, any information with respect to Parent, Merger Sub
and their designees, officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required
by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a
holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates take any action
prior to the Effective Time to remove any Continuing Director from the Company
Board other than for cause.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by a majority
of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one or
two Continuing Directors then in office, all of such Continuing Directors then
in office) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall (A)
not be effective unless there is in office at least one (1) Continuing
Director and (B) constitute the authorization of the Company Board, and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
committee thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless
otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any
amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii)
any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder
by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Companys
rights under this Agreement, (iv) any waiver of any condition to the Companys
obligations hereunder, (v) any amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, (vi) any authorization of any agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
on the other hand, or (vii) the taking of any other action by the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, other than (A) the
Companys performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including the
consummation of the Merger, and (B) other actions that could not reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the
Company (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates). The Continuing Directors
shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current
counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as
determined by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Companys rights hereunder.

 



8 _Section 1.4._ _Option to Acquire Additional Shares_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_
"), exercisable in accordance with this Section 1.4, to purchase the number
of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned in the aggregate by Parent, Merger Sub
and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the exercise
of the Top-Up Option (including all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn in the Offer at the Acceptance Time), shall constitute 5,000 shares
more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for a
purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. The Top-Up
Option shall only be exercised one time by Merger Sub in whole but not in
part.

(b) In no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares
of Company Common Stock in excess of the Companys then authorized and
unissued shares of Company Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued
shares of Company Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any shares
of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any Company
Securities).

 

(c) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Sub (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option) promptly (but in any event within
one (1) Business Day) following the Acceptance Time or the expiration of any
Subsequent Offering Period, as applicable, if (i) at the Acceptance Time or
expiration of a Subsequent Offering Period, as applicable, Parent, Merger Sub
and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub do not own in the aggregate at
least 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and
(ii) after giving effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, and taking
into account the limitations set forth in Section 1.4(b), Parent, Merger Sub
and any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub would own in the aggregate at least
5,000 shares more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares). The obligation of the Company to issue and deliver Top-Up Option
Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions,
unless waived by the Company, that (A) no provision of any applicable Law,
and no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other judgment or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares
in respect of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the
number of Shares owned in the aggregate by Parent, Merger Sub and any
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub constitutes at least 5,000 shares more than
90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (C) Merger Sub
has accepted for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer (including, if applicable, during a Subsequent Offering Period) and not
properly withdrawn and (D) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent
covenants to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently
with any termination of this Agreement. Upon Parents written request, the
Company shall use its

 



9  commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in
writing to Parent the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. Subject to
the terms and conditions this Agreement, and for so long as this Agreement has
not been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company agrees that it shall
maintain out of its existing authorized capital, free from preemptive rights,
sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement so that the Top-Up Option may be exercised
(and, for these purposes, no shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
reserved for issuance pursuant to any other then outstanding Company
Securities).

(d) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Laws,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the
Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub is required to
exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice
thereof (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") specifying (i) a place and time for the
closing of such purchase (which, subject to applicable Law and any required
regulatory approvals, shall be effected as promptly as practicable and not
more than three (3) Business Days after the date of delivery of such Top-Up
Notice), (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will
constitute the Top-Up Option Shares and (iii) the manner in which Parent or
Merger Sub shall pay the applicable purchase price in respect of the Top-Up
Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
(A) the purchase price in respect of the Top-Up Option Shares purchased upon
such exercise of the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the product of (x) the
number of Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option
and (y) the Offer Price) shall be paid to the Company, at Merger Subs
election, either (I) in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Company or (II) by paying in cash an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option Shares and by
delivering Merger Subs unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory
note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Promissory Note_ ") and
in the principal amount of the balance of such purchase price, and (B) the
Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing
the number of Top-Up Option Shares so purchased.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger
Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger
Sub is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares shall
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

(such date upon which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

(b) At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by causing to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger or a certificate of ownership and merger, as
the case may be (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries collectively hold or
acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock after
giving effect to the closing of the Offer and, if applicable, the purchase by
Merger Sub of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and the Company hereby agree to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective,
without a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as practicable.

_Section 2.3._  _Effect of Merger; Organizational Documents; Directors and
Officers_.

Effective Time be amended in its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit C,
until thereafter amended as provided therein and under the DGCL. In addition,
subject to Section 6.9 hereof, Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately
following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all
references to the name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the
name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with
the DGCL. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may
be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

_Section 2.4._ _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock,
each share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

_Section 2.5._ _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of Shares the following shall occur:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and (ii)
any Appraisal Shares) shall at the Effective Time be canceled and converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares
held in book-entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7, without interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
automatically and retired and shall cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 



12 _Section 2.6._ _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time,
such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have
any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a). The Company
shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any written demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in, and following the Acceptance Time to direct, all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration provided to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.7(a) to pay for Shares that are instead paid fair
value in an appraisal proceeding pursuant to Section 262 shall be returned to
Parent upon demand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree and acknowledge that
in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 with respect to the Appraisal
Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving
Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares
or any cash or Promissory Note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company in
payment for such Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in connection with
the determination of the fair value of the Appraisal Shares in accordance with
Section 262\.

 

 _Section 2.7._ _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Companys transfer agent on the date of this Agreement, or
another bank or trust company selected by Parent and approved in advance by
the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Article 2. Parent shall, or shall take all
steps necessary to enable and cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange
Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by
the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash in U.S. dollars
necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to
such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation,

 



13  respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available); _provided further_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares following the
Effective Time and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Exchange Fund includes at all times cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to satisfy
Parents obligation under this Article 2. Any interest or income produced (net
of any loss) by such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be
payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. In the event of any losses
to the Exchange Fund from any investment such that the Exchange Fund is
diminished below the level required for the Exchange Agent to make prompt
cash payments as required under Section 2.7(b), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, as promptly as practicable deposit additional
cash into the Exchange Fund to the extent necessary to reimburse the Exchange
Fund for any such investment losses.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, (i) the
form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (which transmittal letter shall be in
customary form approved by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to be paid promptly in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to such holder, the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all
times from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.7 the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 2.

 



14 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of Certificates and Book Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates and Book Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise required by
Law. 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter only be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time
when such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration that is delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

 _Section 2.8._ _Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Awards_.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all reasonable steps
necessary to provide that each Option, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and be cancelled as of the
Acceptance Time (without regard to the exercise price of such Option) in
exchange for the right to receive at such time, without interest, in
accordance with this Section 2.8(a), a lump sum cash payment in the amount of
the Option Consideration (net of applicable taxes in accordance with Section
2.9), if any, with respect to such Option. In the event that the aggregate
exercise price of any Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable under such
Option, such Option shall be cancelled, without any consideration being
payable in

 



15  respect thereof, and have no further force or effect. Following the
Acceptance Time, no Option shall remain outstanding and all holders of an
Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall
only be entitled to receive the consideration (if any) set forth in this
Section 2.8(a). The Company shall pay any amounts payable to holders of
Options as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, and in no
event later than the first regular payroll cycle following the Acceptance
Time.

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all reasonable steps
necessary to provide that each Restricted Stock Unit, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall
become fully vested and all restrictions and conditions applicable
thereto shall lapse immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and be cancelled
as of the Acceptance Time and converted into the right to receive, without
interest, a cash payment equal to the Offer Price. Following the Acceptance
Time, no Restricted Stock Unit shall remain outstanding and all holders of a
Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time shall only be entitled to receive the consideration set forth in this
Section 2.8(b).

 

(c) Each holder of Restricted Stock Units shall receive from the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in respect of and in consideration
thereof, as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time and in no event
later than the first regular payroll cycle following the Acceptance Time, an
amount (net of applicable taxes in accordance with Section 2.9) equal to the
consideration payable under this Section 2.8, as applicable.

(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administrating the Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions
as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company does not make any representation
or warranty with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.8.

_Section 2.9._ _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, whether to any holder of Shares
or pursuant to Section 2.8, such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld and deducted amounts
will be paid to the applicable Governmental Authority and treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Shares,
Options and Restricted Stock Units, as the case may be, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation.

_Section 2.10._ _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions
of this 

 



16  Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to
take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title
to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

reissues and renewals), trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress,
domain names, copyrights and designs (including industrial designs), in each
case owned by or registered to the Company.

 

(c) The conduct of the business of the Company, as currently conducted
(including the commercialization of current products) does not infringe,
violate or constitute a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of any
third party, except for such infringements, violations and misappropriations
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not and would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company. Since January 1, 2009 and through the
date of this Agreement, the Company has not received any written claim or
written notice from any Person that remains unresolved as of the date of this
Agreement (i) alleging that any Company Intellectual Property or the
operation of the Companys business infringes, violates or misappropriates any
Intellectual Property rights of any third party, or (ii) advising that such 

 



32  Person is challenging or threatening to challenge the ownership, use,
validity or enforceability or non-infringement of any Company Intellectual
Property.

 

(d) None of the material Company Registered Intellectual Property has expired,
lapsed, been held invalid, cancelled or abandoned, and all maintenance and
renewal fees necessary to preserve the material rights of the Company in
connection with such material Company Registered Intellectual Property have
been paid.

(e) The Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect and
maintain the confidentiality of the Company Intellectual Property that is of a
nature that the Company intends to keep confidential and that is material to
the Company.

(f) To the Companys Knowledge, no third party is infringing, violating
or misappropriating, in any material respect, any of the Company Intellectual
Property.

_Section 3.16._ _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has
received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the " _Company Financial
Advisor_ "), dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of
such date, the consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger by
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates). The Company will make available to Parent or its
designee a true and complete copy of such opinion for informational purposes
only, promptly after the receipt of the written version thereof by the
Company. The Company has obtained the authorization of the Company Financial
Advisor consistent with, and subject to the terms of, the agreement with the
Company Financial Advisor set forth in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure
Letter to include a copy of such opinion in the Schedule 14D-9 and, if
applicable, the Proxy Statement or in any information statement that may be
sent to Company stockholders in lieu of a Proxy Statement in connection with
the Merger.

 

 _Section 3.17._ _Insurance_. The Company maintains insurance coverage with
reputable insurers, or maintains effective and sufficient self insurance
practices, in such amounts and providing adequate coverage for such risks as
are reasonable in light of the business conducted by the Company. Section 3.17
of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list as of
the date of this Agreement of all insurance policies (including information on
the scope and amount of the coverage provided thereunder) maintained by the
Company and material to the business of the Company. As of the date of this
Agreement, (a) all such policies are in full force and effect, (b) all
material premiums due and payable thereunder have been paid and (c) no written
notice of cancellation, termination or nonrenewal has been received by
the Company with respect to any of such policies. The Company is not, to the
Companys Knowledge, in material breach or default of any such insurance
policy and has not taken any action or failed to take any action that, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or material modification of any such insurance policies. As
of the date of this Agreement, no insurer has put the Company on written
notice that coverage has or may be denied with respect to a pending claim
equal to or in excess of $100,000 submitted to such insurer by the Company.

 



33 _Section 3.18._ _Material Contracts_.

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent or its designee a complete and
correct copy of each Company Material Contract in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, each of which is listed in Section 3.18(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter or listed as an exhibit to the Company SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Company
Material Contract_ " means the Leases and each of the following Contracts to
which the Company is a party or by which any of its properties or assets are
bound: (i) any Contract (except any purchase order or service order pertaining
to goods or services provided in 2010 and for which payment was made in full
in 2010) pursuant to which the Company spent or received, or is reasonably
likely to spend or is entitled to receive, in the aggregate, more than
$200,000 during 2010 or 2011; (ii) any Contract that relates to any (x)
Intellectual Property that is licensed by a third party to the Company or (y)
Intellectual Property that is licensed by the Company to any third party or
(z) development, use or control over any Intellectual Property by or for the
Company, in the case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), that is material to the
Company; (iii) any Contract that provides for indemnification by the Company
to any Person, other than any Contract entered into in the Ordinary Course of
Business or that is not material to the Company; (iv) any Contract (other than
an Employee Benefit Plan) that is between the Company and (x) any current or
former director of the Company or Executive Officer or (y) any Affiliate of
any such Person identified in the preceding clause (x); (v) any Contract that
is a loan or credit agreement, mortgage, promissory note, indenture or other
Contract evidencing Indebtedness for borrowed money owed by the Company in an
amount in excess of $1.0 million; (vi) any Contract containing any non-
competition, exclusivity or other similar provision that prohibits, limits or
otherwise or restricts the Company or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Acceptance Time, Parent or any of its Affiliates) from engaging in any
operations or business anywhere in the world; (vii) any Contract that is
material to the Company and that contains any so called "most favored nation"
provision or similar provisions requiring the Company to offer to a Person any
terms or conditions that are at least as favorable as those offered to one or
more other Persons; (viii) any Contract that includes a guarantee of
the obligations of any Person that is not the Company; (ix) any Contract
(other than the Stock Plan or a Contract entered into pursuant to the terms
thereof) that contains a put, call or similar right pursuant to which the
Company would be required to purchase or sell, as applicable, any equity
interests of any Person that have a fair market value or purchase price of
more than $1.0 million; (x) each Contract listed in clause (x) of Section
3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Specified Material
Contracts_ ") and (xi) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) with respect to the Company.

 

(b) Each Company Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable on the
Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and is in full force and
effect, except to the extent it has previously expired in accordance with its
terms and except where the failure of any Company Material Contracts to be
valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect, individually or in
the aggregate, is not and would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company. The Company has not, and to the Companys Knowledge, no other
party to any Company Material Contract has, violated any provision of, or
taken, agreed to take or failed to take any act which, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default under, or give
rise to any right of cancellation or termination of or consent under, such
Company Material

 



34  Contract. Since January 1, 2009 until the date of this Agreement, the
Company has not received any written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under any Specified Material Contract, except where the occurrence
of any of the foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, is not and would
not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company.

_Section 3.19._ _Real Property_.

(a) The Company does not own any real property. _Section 3.19(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all leases,
subleases, licenses and other similar agreements under which the Company uses
or otherwise occupies or has the right or option to use or occupy any real
property or interests in real property which is material to the conduct of
business of the Company (collectively, and together with all amendments,
modifications, and supplements thereto, the " _Leases_ ," and the real
property subject thereto, the " _Leased Real Property_ "). Section 3.19(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter also sets forth the parties to and date of each
Lease and the address and primary use of each Leased Real Property. The
Company has not leased or otherwise granted to any Person any right to occupy
or possess any part of the Leased Real Property. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent or its designee true, correct and complete copies of
the Leases in effect as of the date hereof.

(b) The Company has valid leasehold or sublease interests or other comparable
contract rights in or relating to the Leased Real Property free and clear of
all Liens, title defects, encroachments and other survey defects, except for
recorded easements, restrictive covenants, Liens arising under the terms
of the applicable Lease and other encumbrances that do not materially detract
from the value or use of such Leased Real Property (collectively, the "
_Permitted Encumbrances_ ").

 

(c) All of the Leased Real Property has such access to, and such use of, gas,
electricity and other utility services, as are necessary in the conduct of
the business of the Company as presently conducted, directly or through a
valid easement or right of way which is leased or owned by the Company free
and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, except where the
failure to have any such access, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) All buildings, structures, fixtures, building systems and equipment
included in the Leased Real Property (the " _Structures_ ") are in good
condition and repair and sufficient for the operation of the business of the
Company as presently conducted, except where the failure of the foregoing to
be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Leases and this
Agreement, the Company is not a party to or obligated under any option, right
of first refusal or other contractual right to sell, dispose of or lease any
of the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein to any
Person. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not a party to any
agreement or option to purchase any real property other than the Leased Real
Property or interest therein.

 



35 (f) As of the date hereof, the Company has not received any written notices
regarding any pending, threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding
affecting the Leased Real Property or any part thereof or of any sale or other
disposition of the Leased Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of
condemnation or other matters materially affecting and impairing the current
use, occupancy, or value thereof.

_Section 3.20._ _Rights Plan_. The Company Board has approved, and the
Company and the Rights Agent have entered into, an amendment to the Rights
Agreement in the form heretofore provided to Parent or its designee (the "
_Rights Amendment_ "). Pursuant to the Rights Amendment, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Tender and Support Agreement
nor the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will result in (i) Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates becoming an Acquiring Person or (ii) the
occurrence of (A) a Distribution Date, (B) the Share Acquisition Date, (C) a
Section 11(a)(ii) Event or (D) a Section 13 Event, in each case as such terms
are defined in the Rights Agreement.

_Section 3.21._  _Antitakeover Statute_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Section 4.7,
neither Section 203 of the DGCL nor any takeover related provision in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or Companys by-laws, would (a)
prohibit or restrict the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or the Certificate of Merger or its ability to consummate
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (b) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement or
the Certificate of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (c) subject
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to any impediment
or condition in connection with the initiation or consummation of the Offer,
the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement, the Tender and Support
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub in Section 4.7, the approval by the Company Board of the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions constitutes approval thereof for
purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and represents the only action necessary
to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL does not and will not apply to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, including the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

_Section 3.22._ _Inventory_. The inventory of the Company consists of raw
materials and supplies, goods in process, and finished goods, all of which are
fit for their respective intended uses and are not obsolete, damaged,
adulterated, misbranded or defective and, in the case of finished goods, are
of a quantity and quality useable and salable in the Ordinary Course of
Business, except where the failure of the foregoing to be true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

_Section 3.23._ _Interested Party Transactions_. Except for employment
Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and filed as an
exhibit to a Company SEC Report or Contracts in respect of equity grants,
Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) sets forth a correct and
complete list of the Contracts or arrangements under which the Company has
any existing or future liabilities of the type required to be reported by the

 



36  Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC (an "
_Affiliate Transaction_ "), between the Company and any (A) current or former
officers or directors of the Company or any of such officers or directors
immediate family members, (B) record or beneficial owners of more than 5% of
the Company Common Stock, or (C) any Affiliate of any such officer, director
or owner, since January 1, 2009, and (ii) identifies each Affiliate
Transaction that has been terminated since January 1, 2009 or is in existence
as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent or
its designee correct and complete copies of each Contract or other relevant
documentation (including any amendments or modifications thereto) providing
for each Affiliate Transaction.

_Section 3.24._ _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Article 3, the
Company makes no other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or its business, operations, assets, liabilities,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery
or disclosure to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives of any documentation, forecasts or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge the foregoing.

preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for

correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its being
filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel a

stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that the Company makes no
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty with respect to information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent necessary
such that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time
prior to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur
any event or any information should be discovered that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement and to cause the
Proxy Statement as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares as
promptly as reasonably practicable after filing the Proxy Statement with the

this Agreement (the " _Company Voting Proposal_ ") by the stockholders of the
Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) shall
not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,

the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Company stockholders. The Company shall, unless a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by Section 6.8 has occurred, (i) use
reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its
stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and (ii) take all
other reasonable action necessary to secure the Required Company Stockholder
Vote.

purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares beneficially owned by

for quorum purposes and voted in favor of the Company Voting Proposal.

 

 _Section 6.2._ _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) During the period commencing on the date of the Acceptance Time and ending
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent will provide, or cause to
be provided, to each Company Employee (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate,
and a total annual compensation opportunity, which at the election of Parent,
is (x) at least equal to such Company Employees base salary or hourly wage
rate and total annual compensation opportunity (including any cash bonuses
and excluding any equity-based compensation) immediately before the Acceptance
Time or (y) the base salary or hourly wage rate and total annual compensation
opportunity (including any cash bonuses and excluding any equity-based
compensation) at least equal to those amounts provided by Parent to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and (ii) subject to Section
6.2(d), the opportunity to participate in employee benefit plans, programs
and policies which provide benefits that are at least comparable in the
aggregate, at the election of Parent, to either (x) the benefits provided to
such Company Employee under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies
(including severance plans) sponsored by the Company immediately before the
Acceptance Time or (y) the benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as those employee benefit plans,
programs and policies are amended from time to time. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Employee_ " means any person who is an employee of the
Company immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

(b) Parent will grant, or will cause to be granted, full credit to each
Company Employee for (i) his or her employment with the Company prior to the
Acceptance Time for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to
participate in any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company), vesting in any benefit under any such
plan, program or policy and for calculating his or her level of benefits with
respect to severance, vacations, personal days off and any other welfare-type
benefits (expressly excluding, notwithstanding the foregoing, any defined
benefit pension plan or any retiree medical or other benefits based on early
retirement) where service is a factor in calculating the level of benefits
except where such credit would result in a duplication in benefits, and (ii)
any payments made by such employee or any of his or her dependents under any
Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year for such plan which includes the
Acceptance Time for which he or she was eligible to receive credit under such
plan towards satisfying any applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
expense requirements.

(c) Any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) shall not impose any pre-existing
conditions, exclusions, waiting periods or "actively at work" requirements
with respect to any Company Employee, except to the extent such requirements
would have been imposed under the Employee Benefit Plans and have not already
been satisfied or as required pursuant to any insurance policy applicable to
all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(d) Notwithstanding any election made by Parent pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(ii), Parent will honor, or cause to be honored, any and all obligations
which are in effect as 

 



46  of the Acceptance Time under any Employee Benefit Plans (including any
employment, bonus or similar agreements between the Company and a Company
Employee (excluding any equity based obligations) to any employee or former
employee of the Company or any dependents of any such employee or former
employee.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Employee Benefit Plan
of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document. Nothing
in this Section 6.2 shall obligate Parent to, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to employ any person for any period of time after the Effective
Time, and this Section 6.2 shall not be construed to limit the ability of
Parent to alter the terms and conditions of, or terminate, the employment of
any person (other than as provided expressly in this Section 6.2). Without
limiting the generality of Section 9.8(b), nothing in this Section 6.2 shall
be construed as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent
or beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Section 6.2.

 

 _Section 6.3._ _Antitrust Filings_.

(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after the date hereof), file or cause to be filed with the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and any comparable non-United States antitrust or
competition authority any notifications required to be filed under the HSR
Act or comparable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree,
and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to

Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) to respond to any government
requests for information under any Antitrust Law, (iii) to contest and resist
any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and

prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other
Transaction under any Antitrust Law.

 

(c) Prior to the Board Appointment Time, the parties will jointly and,
following the Board Appointment Time (but subject to the terms of Section
1.3(c)), Parent will, determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate
all activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers of any Governmental Authority as contemplated hereby, and the parties
will each take such actions as reasonably requested by the other parties in
connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. If any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction as violative of any Antitrust Law,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects
with each other and shall use its respective commercially reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist

 



47  any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction.

(d) The parties agree not to extend directly or indirectly any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any applicable non-United States Antitrust Law or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, except with the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and each party agrees to use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken (and
if applicable, to cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to take) all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable under the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties
shall request and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of Parent and Merger
Sub and the Company shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any material
written communication to that party from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and, subject to applicable
Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Authority and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend, (iii) furnish the other party with
copies of all material correspondence, filings and written communications
between them and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one
hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions and (iv) furnish the other party with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and each other
matter as may be required by Law in connection with every statement, filing,

Authority in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions.

release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.8 and until the
Board Appointment Date, the Company and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with each other prior to issuing, and
to provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, except as may be required by Law or court
process or any listing agreement with or rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market or by the request of Governmental Agency;
_provided_ , _however_ , that these restrictions shall not limit or restrict
the Companys rights pursuant to Section 6.8. In addition, nothing contained
herein shall limit the ability of any party to commence litigation or file any
pleadings in respect thereof without complying with the terms set forth in
this Section 6.4.

herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (and Parent

capable of taking, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (a)
obtaining all consents, approvals, authorizations and actions or nonactions
required for the consummation by the parties hereto of the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions (including any required or recommended

consent or approval required for the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
other than de minimis amounts or amounts that are advances or simultaneously
reimbursed by Parent. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that they shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such necessary
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities.

 

 _Section 6.6._ _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting

case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall not (a) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or (b) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice; _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
any such notice pursuant to Section 6.3(d)(i), Section 6.3(d)(iii) or this

obligations hereunder so long as all of the other conditions to the
performance of such partys obligations (other than compliance with such
Sections) have been satisfied or waived.

_Section 6.7._ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company to afford Parent,
Merger Sub and the officers, employees and agents of Parent and Merger Sub

49  disrupt or interfere with business operations, to the Companys properties,
facilities, books and records and other assets as Parent shall reasonably
request, including access to the Companys directors, officers and employees,
and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel, in each case (A) as Parent
through its officers, employees or agents may reasonably request, (B) that
are in the possession, custody or control of the Company, and (C) the
disclosure of which would not violate any Law or cause to be waived the
attorney client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege or violate any obligation of the Company with respect to
confidentiality (provided the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a waiver of any such confidentiality provision if requested
by Parent); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that subject to the Companys
obligations pursuant to Section 6.8, the Company shall have no obligation
pursuant to this Section 6.7 regarding any communications, information or
other materials regarding either (a) a Takeover Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal, or (b) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.
No investigation by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their officers, employees or
agents and no other receipt of information by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their officers, employees or agents shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation or warranty of the Company or any covenant or other
provision in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will hold, and will direct
their respective officers, employees and agents to hold, any such information
that is non-public in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No additional investigations or disclosures shall affect the
Companys representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement.

(b) Until the Board Appointment Time, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement dated February 23, 2011 between Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp. and the

relates to this Agreement and the Transactions.

_Section 6.8._ _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company has, and each of its Representatives have, ceased and caused
to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation
with any Third Parties that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to a Takeover Proposal. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Acceptance Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.8, the Company shall not, and shall direct each of its directors,
officers, employees, consultants, advisors (including, without limitation,
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and financial advisors), agents and
other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate the submission of any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate or engage
in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information
to, any Third Party in connection with, or for the purposes of encouraging or
facilitating, a Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse, recommend or enter
into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) in accordance with
Section 6.8(b) below) relating 

 



50  to or providing for a Takeover Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ") or (iv) take any other action designed to, or that would
knowingly facilitate, the making or receipt of any Takeover Proposal or the
consummation thereof. The Company shall be deemed to be in breach of the
provisions of this Section 6.8 upon the breach of any such provisions by the
Companys Representatives.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.8(a) or
any other provision of this Agreement, at any time after the date hereof and
prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, may, subject to compliance with this
Section 6.8, (i) furnish non-public information to any Third Party that has
submitted a Takeover Proposal (provided, that (A) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the
Company in any material respect (other than any standstill provision, which
shall be no less favorable to the Company in any respect) than the terms set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and (B) any material non-public information concerning the
Company provided to any Third Party given such access shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or Merger
Sub at substantially the same time it is provided to such Third Party), (ii)
contact any Third Party that has submitted a Takeover Proposal solely to
clarify the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, and (iii) engage
in discussions or negotiations with, and take any other actions referred to
clauses (i) or (ii) of Section 6.8(a) with respect to, the Takeover Proposal
submitted by such Third Party if, in the case of clause (i) and clause (iii)
immediately above, such Third Party has submitted a Takeover Proposal which
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal. Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in
clause (i) or clause (iii) of this Section 6.8(b), the Company shall notify
Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-
public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this Section 6.8(b).

(c) Except as permitted by this Section 6.8(c) or Section 6.8(d), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw (or not
continue to make), change, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to
make), change, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Board Recommendation; (ii) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares
of capital stock of the Company that constitutes a Takeover Proposal is
commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company, which shall
constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof, or
(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend any
Takeover Proposal made or received after the date hereof (any of the actions
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.8(c), a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (iv) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board shall be permitted, (x) subject to compliance with
Section 6.8 and the concurrent payment

 



51  of any amount owed the Company pursuant to Section 8.3, in response to an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof, to terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal if the Company Board (A) has received a Takeover Proposal
that, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to,
Section 6.8(d), (B) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (C) provides to Parent the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which the Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated, or (y) subject to compliance with Section 6.8, to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such
definition, in response to a material fact, event, change, development or set
of circumstances (other than a Takeover Proposal) occurring or arising after
the date of this Agreement that was not known by the Company Board as of or
prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any
Takeover Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that, in light of
such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to violate
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause (y) unless the
Company has (A) provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such
action and specifying the facts underlying the Company Boards determination
that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such
three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of
the Intervening Event. 

(d) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under
Section 6.8(c), in each case, with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i)
the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such action that
includes the material terms of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such
action (including the identity of the Third Party making the Superior
Proposal), (ii) during the four (4) Business Day period following Parents
and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and
Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and (iii) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period,
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, taking into account
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub,
that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.8(d); 

 



52   _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the four (4) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period.

 

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day),
provide Parent and Merger Sub a copy of all draft agreements (and any other
written material to the extent such material contains any financial terms,
conditions or other material terms relating to any Takeover Proposal
or, where no such written materials are available, a reasonably detailed
description of such Takeover Proposal) or any request for non-public
information in connection with any Takeover Proposal (including the identity
of the Person or group making the Takeover Proposal or request, as
applicable), and shall keep Parent and Merger Sub reasonably informed of the
status of any such Takeover Proposal or request on a reasonably current basis
(and in any event at Parents request and otherwise within one (1) Business
Day after the occurrence of any material amendments, developments, discussions
or negotiations) and provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt or delivery
thereof), copies of all other written inquiries or correspondence sent by or
provided to the Company (or its Representatives) in connection with any such
Takeover Proposal or request.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to
a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the Companys stockholders), or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the taking of any such position or making of
any such disclosure pursuant to clause (i) immediately above shall be subject
to and only taken in compliance with Section 6.8(c) and _provided_ , 
_further_ that any such disclosure or communication pursuant to clause (i)
immediately above other than, or which is not accompanied by, (x) an express
rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or (y) an express
reaffirmation of the Board Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

_Section 6.9._  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of
expenses, indemnification and exculpation by the Company now existing in
favor of each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company (each, together with such persons heirs, executors
or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Companys
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date
of this Agreement which have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

 



53 (b) From and after the Acceptance Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing, subject to the indemnifying or advancing
partys receipt of an unsecured undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party to repay such funds if it is ultimately determined in a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder) each
Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any Action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Acceptance Time in
connection with such Indemnified Party serving as an officer or director of
the Company or any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, to
cause the individuals who have served as officers and directors of the Company
prior to the Effective Time who are then covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance policy currently maintained by the Company (the
" _D andO Insurance_"), to be covered under a prepaid directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
such individuals than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy, for a period of not less than six (6) years after
the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions of
such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
respect of this Agreement and the Transactions) in their capacities as such,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain
or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall procure and maintain for such six-year (6) period as much coverage as is
available for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause
coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by causing the Surviving
Corporation to obtain a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO Insurance,
and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting Tail
Endorsement," provided that the Company does not pay more than the amount set
forth in Section 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter for such Reporting
Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that Parent causes the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and
effect for its full term, Parent shall be relieved from its obligations under
this Section 6.9(c).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper

 



54  provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9.

 

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.9 applies without the written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9).
Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may
be incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with their enforcement of
their rights provided in this Section 6.9; _provided_ that such Indemnified
Party prevails in such enforcement action.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and directors
of the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement.

_Section 6.10._  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.8 and any other dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (in accordance with that certain SEC
No-Action Letter to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, dated January
12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters).

 

 _Section 6.11._ _Rule 14d-10(d)_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the
extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through its Compensation
Committee or its independent directors, to the extent required) shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause each employment compensation, severance
and employee benefit agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by
the Company on or after the date of this Agreement with any of its officers,
directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such
officers, director or employee to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

_Section 6.12._ _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and Parent and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if
any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option or any of the other Transactions, use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up
Option and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions. The Company shall not take any action to approve any
Takeover Proposal made by any Person other than Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent for purposes of any state takeover Law or to cause any state takeover
Law that would otherwise apply to any such Takeover Proposal to become
inapplicable thereto,

 



55  except to the extent such action is taken immediately prior to or
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement by the Company in
accordance with Section 8.1(d).

 

 _Section 6.13._ _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC to
enable the de-listing of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation from
The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the deregistration of such common stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

 _Section 6.14._ _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand
and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Board Appointment Date, and (b) prior to
the Board Appointment Date, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

 _Section 6.15._ _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide to Parent an affidavit, dated as of the Closing Date, signed under
penalty of perjury, and in form and substance required under the Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445(f) and Section 897 of the Code, so
that Parent is exempt from withholding any portion of the aggregate
consideration with respect to the Merger under Section 1445 of the Code.

_Section 6.16._  _Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any litigation commenced against it or any of its directors, officers or
Affiliates, relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including the
Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any
such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any litigation against the
Company and its directors relating to this Agreement and the Transactions,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

 _Section 6.17._ _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and, following the Board Appointment Time, the Company, to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, a written consent adopting this Agreement.

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of the Acceptance
Time to occur on or before the Walk Away Date was caused by or resulted from
the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform in any
material respect any covenant or agreement in this Agreement required to be
performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party); or

 

(ii) if any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a

thereof shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_  that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party to this Agreement if
the issuance of such Judgment,

 



57  Law, legal restraint or prohibition was caused by or resulted from the
failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform in any
material respect any covenant or agreement in this Agreement required to be
performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party); or

(c) by Parent, if (x) there shall have occurred a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (y) the Company shall have materially breached any of
its obligations under Section 6.8, _provided_ that such material breach was
the result of actions taken or not taken by, at the direction of or with the
consent or knowledge of any member of the Companys Knowledge group, any
member of the Company Board or senior individual employed by the any financial
or legal advisor to the Company in connection with the Transactions, or in
the case of any other material breach of Section 6.8, such breach became known
to any member of the Companys Knowledge group or any member of the Company

cease to be ongoing, or (z) the Company Board fails publicly to reaffirm its
recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (A) within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of a written request by Parent or Merger Sub to
provide such reaffirmation following a Takeover Proposal that is communicated
publicly to the stockholders of the Company (which reaffirmation request may
be made by Parent or Merger Sub only once with respect to each Takeover
Proposal or any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Takeover Proposal that is communicated publicly to the stockholders of
the Company) or (B) if the Acceptance Time is less than five (5) Business Days
from the receipt of such request by Parent or Merger Sub, by the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time;

(d) by the Company, if both of the following conditions are satisfied and
subject to the Company having not materially breached any of its obligations
under Section 6.8: (A) the Company Board prior to or concurrently with such
termination approves, and substantially concurrently with such termination
enters into, an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal, to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, the terms and
conditions of Section 6.8(c) and Section 6.8(d); and (B) the Company
simultaneously with such termination pays, or causes to be paid, the
Termination Fee required by Section 8.3(c) to Parent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds;

(e) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach of or
failure to perform, as applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than
the covenants or agreements set forth in Section 6.8, in respect of which
Section 8.1(c)(y) shall apply), which breach or failure to perform (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in clauses 2(b) or 2(c) of Annex A not to be
satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (x)
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform from Parent, or (y) the Walk Away Date;
_provided,_ that the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to Parent if Parent or Merger Sub is
then in breach of any covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement
which breach would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

(f) by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time, if there has been a breach of
or failure to perform, as applicable, any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform

 



58  shall have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and shall not have been cured
prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Company, or (ii)
the Walk Away Date; _provided_ , that the right of the Company to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) shall not be available to the
Company if the Company is then in breach of any covenant or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement which would cause the condition set forth in
clause 2(c) of Annex A not to be satisfied; or 

(g) by the Company, if, for any reason, (i) Merger Sub shall have failed to
commence the Offer within the time period specified in the first sentence of
Section 1.1(a), (ii) Merger Sub terminates or makes any change to the Offer in
material breach of the terms of this Agreement, or (iii) Merger Sub shall have
breached its obligation hereunder to purchase all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn as of the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent
Expiration Date established in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement, _provided_ that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (ii) unless the
breach referred to therein shall not have been cured prior to earlier of (x)
three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such
breach from the Company and (y) five (5) Business Days prior to the Walk Away
Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may not be terminated following
the Acceptance Time. Except in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(a), the party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written
notice of such termination to the other party or parties to this Agreement,
setting forth in such notice the provision of this Section 8.1 pursuant to
which such party is terminating this Agreement.

_Section 8.2._ _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and of no effect without any liability on the part of any party
hereto, and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease and
terminate, except for the provisions of (a) this Section 8.2, (b) Section 8.3
(Fees and Expenses), and (c) Article 9 (General Provisions), which shall
survive such termination and remain in full force and effect; _provided_ ,
_however,_ that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything else
contained herein to the contrary, shall relieve any party from any liability
or damages that is attributable to fraud or to any willful breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination in accordance with the terms set
forth herein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 8.3._ _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is
consummated.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to
clause (y) or clause (z) of Section 8.1(c), or (ii) either (x) Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or (y) Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(e), so long as, in any such case, (A) before the date of such
termination, a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced

 



59  or otherwise been publicly communicated to the holders of Company Common
Stock, and, in each case, not subsequently publicly withdrawn, and (B) within
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination (x) the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement in respect of any Takeover Proposal
and (y) such Takeover Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds
an amount equal to $17,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), such payment to
be made no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of the
consummation of such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), each reference to "20%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%".

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to
clause (x) of Section 8.1(c) or (ii) the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d),
then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to the Termination Fee, such
payment to be made (A) in the case of a termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i), no later that the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of
termination or (B) in the case of a termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (ii), concurrently with such termination.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to pay a
Termination Fee pursuant to more than one clause of this Section 8.3 or on
more than one occasion, and that the Termination Fee shall be reduced by any
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to
applicable Tax Law. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii)
the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where a Termination Fee is payable by the Company are uncertain and incapable
of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section
8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), as applicable, are not a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
and Merger Sub, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii)
without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement, and (iv) payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to the applicable
provision of this Section 8.3 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent, Merger Sub, any Affiliate thereof or any other Person against the
Company and its Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees or
Representatives in connection with any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to a provision for which the Termination Fee is payable. Accordingly, if the
Company fails timely to pay the Termination Fee when due pursuant to Section
8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent its documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made, plus two percent (2%).

_Section 8.4._ _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to
the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or

 



60  authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards
of Directors or stockholders of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after any such adoption by the holders of Shares, no amendment shall be
made that, by applicable Law, requires further approval of such stockholders,
without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

_Section 8.5._ _Waiver_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights or preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

_Section 8.6._ _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_.
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order
to be effective, require, in the case of Merger Sub or the Company, action by
its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of
Directors (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the approval
contemplated by Section 1.3).

_Section 9.2._ _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

_Section 9.3._ _Interpretations_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this Agreement,
(i) the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii)
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if"; and (iii)
"hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. With respect to the
determination of any period of time, the words "from," "since," "between"
mean "from and including" and the words "to" and "until" each mean "to but
excluding." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this
Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter
forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural,
and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. References to
an agreement or instrument mean such agreement or instrument as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented. The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in
an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting
such agreement or document. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Company shall
not be deemed to be in breach of its obligations pursuant Section 2.8 in the
event (i) any holder of Options and/or Restricted Stock Units alleges
that his or her Options and/or Restricted Stock Units were not validly
cancelled by the Company or (ii) if any Options or Restricted Stock Units are,
or are deemed to be, outstanding following the Acceptance Time.

 

 _Section 9.4._ _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the conflict or choice of laws provisions thereof that would give
rise to the application of the domestic substantive law of any other
jurisdiction.

 

 _Section 9.5._ _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement (i) consents to submit itself to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (ii)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any such court, (iii) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat 

 



63  such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court, (iv) agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgments, attachments prior to
judgment, attachments in advance of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and (v) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought
and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any
other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be
served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
Section 9.1. Nothing in this Section 9.5(a), however, shall affect the right
of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

_Section 9.6._  _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of facsimile
transmission or other electronic transmission, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or .pdf transmission.

_Section 9.7._ _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and
after the Effective Time, Section 6.9 (with respect to which the Indemnified
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries) is for the benefit of the Persons
named therein and such Persons may specifically enforce such provisions.

 

 _Section 9.8._ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then
such contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement.
Such provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to
render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall
render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed
as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

 



64 _Section 9.9._ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Exhibits hereto and the documents and
instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at Closing) and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the terms of the understandings of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the
parties hereto, or any of them, whether written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance
on any such prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent
not embodied in this Agreement. The representations and warranties set forth
in Articles 3 and 4 and (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein)
the covenants set forth in this Agreement have been made solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and (a) may be intended not as
statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the
parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified
by reference to the Company Disclosure Letter, which contains certain
disclosures that are not reflected in the text of this Agreement; and (c) may
apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be
viewed as material by shareholders of, or other investors in, the Company.

 

 _Section 9.10._ _Enforcement_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and this right shall include the
right of the parties to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the terms
set forth in this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or injunctive
relief or both pursuant to Section 9.10(a), each party may pursue any other
remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including monetary damages;
_provided_ , that it is understood and agreed that claims for monetary damages
following termination of this Agreement shall be limited to those arising
from or relating to any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. If a court has granted an award of damages in connection with any
willful breach by Parent and/or Merger Sub of the terms or conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company may, on behalf of its stockholders,
enforce such award and accept damages for such breach, and Parent agrees that
such damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-
pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Companys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
other combination opportunities and the time value of money). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, no party hereto shall be permitted to
make commence any action, suit or proceeding seeking monetary damages against
any other party 

 



65  hereto in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to the
right of any party to seek such monetary damages following such termination
in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this
Agreement.

 

 _Section 9.11._ _Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has had or is reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary
Course of Business.

consummation of the Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the Offer;

(b) (i) any of the Companys representations or warranties set forth in the
second sentence of Section 3.2(a) or the first or last sentences of Section
3.2(d) shall not be true

and as of such date), (ii) any of the Companys representations or warranties

and as of such date), (iii) any of the Companys representations or
warranties set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.6 shall not be true

Acceptance Time (or, in the case of any such representation or warranty made
as of a specific date, on and as of such date) or (iv) any of the Companys
other representations and warranties set forth in the Article 3 of the

Time, or (B) are made as of a specific date are not true and correct in all
respects on and as of such date, except, with respect to this clause (iv),
where the failure of such representations or warranties to be so true and

"Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations
and warranties), individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

respect any covenant or obligation required to be performed or complied with
by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

(including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided nothing
herein shall relieve any party from any obligation or liability such party has
under the Agreement) giving rise to any such condition and may be waived only
by Parent or Merger Sub, and then, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub (except for any
condition that, 

 



Annex A-2   pursuant to Section 1.1(e) of the Agreement, may only be waived with the
Companys consent). The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time in accordance with the terms of
the Agreement.

Payee being issued pursuant to Section 1.4 of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of April 5, 2011 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among Maker,
Payee and Merck and Co., Inc., a company formed under the laws of New Jersey.

Maker represents, warrants and covenants that (i) the issuance and delivery of
this Note has been duly and validly authorized and (ii) this Note is a valid

performance lies at the discretion of a court in equity.

indebtedness of the Maker.

If an Event of Default (as defined below) under this Note shall occur and be
continuing, then the Payee shall have the right to declare the entire
principal balance and all accrued interest under this note due and payable. An
"Event of Default" shall occur hereunder upon the occurrence of any one or
more of the following events with respect to Maker: (i) if Maker shall fail
to pay when due any payment of principal or interest on this Note; (ii) if,
pursuant to or within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any
other federal or state law relating to insolvency or relief of debtors (a "
_Bankruptcy Law_ "), Maker shall (1) commence a voluntary case or proceeding;
(2) consent to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary
case; (3) consent to the appointment of a trustee, receiver, assignee,
liquidator or similar official; (4) make an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors; or (5) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they
become due; or (iii) if a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or

involuntary case; (2) appoints a trustee, receiver, assignee, liquidator or
similar official for Maker or substantially all of Makers properties; or (3)

agents at their addresses set forth in Section 9.1 of the Merger Agreement.
Any notice deemed to have been given two business days after delivery to the
courier service or five days after deposited in the U.S. mail, as the case may
be.

This Note is not transferable or assignable by its holder without the prior
written consent of the Maker.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws and
the State of New York, and the terms hereof may only be changed by written
agreement.

B-1  Exhibit C

Form of Amended Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

 

1\. The name of the corporation is Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
"Corporation").

 

2\. The address of its registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209
Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware,
19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation
Trust Company.

3\. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity
for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").

 

4\. The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall be shares of Common Stock
with the par value of $0.01 per share.

5\. The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the
bylaws of the Corporation.

6\. Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the Corporation
(the "By-laws") shall so require, the election of directors of the
Corporation need not be by written ballot.

7\. The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the
DGCL.

8\. To the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as amended from time to
time, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. Any amendment or repeal of the foregoing provision shall
not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such amendment or repeal.

 

9\. (a) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to
become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has
agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or
trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan)
(all such persons being referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by
reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity,
against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if
he

 



C-1   acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 9, except as set forth in Section 9(f) below, the Corporation shall
not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the
initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 

(b) _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation
shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of
the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request
of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar
capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any
action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all
expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court
shall deem proper.

(c)  _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding the
other provisions of this Section 9, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been
successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Sections 9(a) and 9(b), or in defense of any claim,
issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or
proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection
therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding
is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without
prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii)
an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that
the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and
(v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the
Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly
successful with respect thereto.

 



C-2  (d) _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to his right
to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as
soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving
him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified,
the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense
and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to
the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation
shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other
than as provided below in this Section 9(d). The Indemnitee shall have the
right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of
its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the
Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been
authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on
any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the
conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in
fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of
which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at
the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Section 9\. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the
Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of
the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. 

(e) _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(f) below, in
the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to
Section 9(d) of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the
Corporation receives notice under this Section 9, any expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter,
provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by
an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be
made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be
determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Section 9\. Such undertaking may be accepted
without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such
repayment.

 

(f) _Procedure for Indemnification_. In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Sections 9(a), 9(b), 9(c) or 9(e), the
Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in
such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to
the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to
what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of
expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of
the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under
Sections 9(a), 9(b) or 9(e) the Corporation determines, by clear and
convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not
meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 9(a) or 9(b),
as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a) a
majority vote of a

 



C-3   quorum of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not
at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question
("disinterested directors"), (b) if no such quorum is obtainable, a majority
vote of a committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c) a majority
vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to
vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of
stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or
proceeding in question, (d) independent legal counsel (who may be regular
legal counsel to the Corporation), or (e) a court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this
Section 9 shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent
jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or
if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above
in Section 9(f). Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that
the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this Section 9 shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the
Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 9(f) that the Indemnitee
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct. The Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the Corporation.

(h) _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this
Section 9 or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable
laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to
indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of
such amendment, termination or repeal.

(i) _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by this Section 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding
office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing
contained in this Section 9 shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation
is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers
and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from
those set forth in this Section 9\. In addition, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Section 9\.

 

(j) _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Section 9 to indemnification by the Corporation for some or
a portion of the expenses

 



C-4   (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but
not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the
Indemnitee is entitled.

(k) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,
liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 

(l) _Merger or Consolidation_. If the Corporation is merged into or
consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the
surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations
of the Corporation under this Section 9 with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or
consolidation.

(m) _Savings Clause_. If this Section 9 or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Section 9 that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

(n)  _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and
Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings assigned to such
terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

 

(o) _Subsequent Legislation_. If the DGCL is amended after adoption of this
Section 9 to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees,
then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

10\. The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to
amend or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation,
and add other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at
the time in force, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by applicable
law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred
upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant
to this Certificate of Incorporation (as amended) are granted subject to the
rights reserved in this Section.
