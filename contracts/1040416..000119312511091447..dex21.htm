the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his

that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in
which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses

indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.
After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such
claim, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;9(d). The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its
assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that
there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii)&nbsp;the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the
defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Section&nbsp;9. The Corporation shall not be entitled,
without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above.

not assume the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;9(d) of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Section&nbsp;9, any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Section&nbsp;9. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such repayment. </FONT></P>

extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of
the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Sections 9(a), 9(b) or 9(e) the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in Sections 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a)&nbsp;a majority vote of a </FONT></P>

no such quorum is obtainable, a majority vote of a committee of two or more disinterested directors, (c)&nbsp;a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class,

enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the 60-day period referred to above in Section&nbsp;9(f). Unless otherwise
provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section&nbsp;9 shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;9(f) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees)
incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT

rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such
amendment, termination or repeal. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(i) <U>Other Rights</U>. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this
Section&nbsp;9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to
the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;9 shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and
directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Section&nbsp;9. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to
other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Section&nbsp;9. </FONT></P>
