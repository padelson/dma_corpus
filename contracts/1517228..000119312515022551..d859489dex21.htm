short-form business and asset transfer agreements entered 

 



46  into between Seller or the applicable Asset Selling Entity, on the one hand,
and Purchaser or its applicable Permitted Designee, on the other hand, each in
substantially the form attached as  _Exhibit G_ with such modifications as
are necessary in order to maintain substantially the same legal meaning and
effect under local Law as provided in this Agreement (the " _Business Transfer
Agreements_ "), provided that if such Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities
of any such Asset Selling Entity are of a type or nature that are not
transferable under local Law or custom pursuant to a Business Transfer
Agreement, or if a Business Transfer Agreement is not sufficient under local
Law or custom to transfer to Purchaser or its Permitted Designee such
applicable Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, the transfer of such
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities shall be effected or further
substantiated, as applicable, pursuant to the Other Transfer Documents. The
transfer of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities of the U.S. Asset
Selling Entities will be effected pursuant to an assignment, assumption and
bill of sale in substantially the form of _Exhibit H_ (the " _General
Assignment and Assumption Agreement_ ").

(b) The transfer of the Equity Interests of each Conveyed Entity will be
effected at the Closing (or at the Delayed Transfer Closing, as applicable)
pursuant to short-form equity transfer agreements, forms, notarial deeds,
instruments or other similar documents necessary to transfer to Purchaser or
its applicable Permitted Designee the Equity Interests of such Conveyed Entity
in accordance with the Laws of the jurisdiction of organization, incorporation
or formation of such Conveyed Entity (including any necessary
notarizations, legalizations or other attestation and execution formalities
to the extent required by applicable Law), in each case, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Parties (the " _Equity Transfer Documents_ "). The
certificates, if any, representing the Equity Interests shall be duly
endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in blank by
the respective Equity Selling Entities, with all appropriate stock Transfer
Tax stamps affixed (provided that such requirements in relation to
certificates, stock powers and Transfer Tax shall be subject to any other
equivalent or alternative procedures as are required under applicable Law to
effect the valid transfer of the Equity Interests), and such other deeds,
documents and instruments as are necessary or appropriate to effect the valid
transfer of the Equity Interests.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Equity Transfer
Documents or Business Transfer Agreements, any consideration paid by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates to Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any
Equity Transfer Documents or Business Transfer Agreements shall be deemed for
all purposes to comprise part of, and not be in addition to, the Purchase
Price payable hereunder.

 

Section 2.7 Consents; Additional Services.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 2.11(d), there shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement any Real Property Lease, Equipment Lease, Permit, Assumed
Contract, Contract or other Purchased Asset which is not assignable or
transferable (i) without the consent of any Person other than the Seller
Entities, the Conveyed Companies or any Subsidiary of Seller or Purchaser, to
the extent that such consent shall not have been given prior to the Closing or
(ii) without violating any applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller and each of the Seller Entities and Purchaser shall have the
continuing obligation until twelve (12) months after the Closing to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents to the assignment or
transfer thereof, it 

 



47  being understood that (x) other than general internal costs, overhead and
use of internal personnel and assets or infrastructure, neither the Seller
Entities, Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries
shall be required to expend money, incur any Liability, commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party to obtain such consents and (y) in connection therewith, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, if prior to the Closing,
the Conveyed Companies) not to, (A) commit to make any payments other than
cash payments that are Retained Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior
to the Closing or (B) make any non-monetary concession that would purport to
bind Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Business or any Conveyed Company following
the Closing. Upon obtaining the requisite third-party consents thereto, such
Real Property Leases, Equipment Leases, Permits, Assumed Contracts, Contracts
or other Purchased Asset shall promptly be transferred and assigned to
Purchaser hereunder at no additional cost.

 

(b) Subject to Section 2.11(d), with respect to any Purchased Asset that is
not transferred and assigned to Purchaser at the Closing by reason of Section
2.7(a), after the Closing, until any requisite consent is obtained therefor
and the same is transferred and assigned to Purchaser, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
for Purchaser, at no cost to Seller or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, an
arrangement with respect thereto to provide for Purchaser substantially
comparable benefits therein and to otherwise put Purchaser and Seller (and
their respective Affiliates) in the position they would have been in had such
Purchased Asset been transferred at the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, without further
consideration therefor, pay and remit to Purchaser or its Permitted Designee
all monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such
Purchased Asset as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof
and Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due, all
of the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates in respect of such
performance as would have been assumed by Purchaser hereunder if such
Purchased Asset had been transferred at the Closing. Other than with respect
to the Retained Liabilities, Purchaser agrees to indemnify the Seller or any
of its Affiliates in respect of all Liabilities of the Seller Entities in
respect of any such arrangement, continuing operations and underlying lease,
license, Contract, agreement or right.

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to the
Real Property Leases, Equipment Leases, Permits, Assumed Contracts, Contracts
or rights and that such consents may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees that,
subject to Sellers compliance in all material respects with Sellers
agreements and covenants under this Agreement (i) neither the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default under, or acceleration or termination of, any Real Property Lease,
Equipment Lease, Permit, Assumed Contract, Contract or right, as a result
thereof and (ii) other than to the extent that a failure to disclose (A) such
matter or (B) the need for such consent or approval constitutes a breach of a
specific representation or warranty set forth herein (and without limiting any
Purchaser Indemnitees rights as a result of the foregoing), Purchaser
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and (without limiting
in any way the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(b) or Section
6.2(d)) no condition to Purchasers obligations to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of
the

 



48  failure, in and of itself, to obtain any such consent or as a result of any
such default, acceleration or termination or any lawsuit, action, claim,
proceeding or investigation, commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person, arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any
such default, acceleration or termination; _provided_ that, other than as set
forth in clause (ii) above, this sentence shall not be deemed to limit
Purchasers or the other Purchaser Indemnitees rights, or Sellers
obligations, under this Agreement.

 

(d) In the event that during the period prior to the Closing, Purchaser
identifies any service, other than an Excluded Service, material to the
operation of the Business that was provided to the Business during the twelve
(12) month period prior to the Effective Time by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, either directly or indirectly through third-party service
providers, that Purchaser reasonably believes is necessary for it and its
Affiliates to operate the Business following the Closing substantially as
conducted during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Effective Time (and
which service is not contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Document
to be provided through the Purchased Assets or Conveyed Companies), Purchaser
and Seller shall add such service to the Transition Services Agreement such
that Seller or its Affiliates will, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Transition Services Agreement generally applicable to other Services
thereunder, provide (or arrange for the provision of) such service to
Purchaser and its Affiliates at substantially the same costs charged to
the Sellers or its Affiliates retained businesses (adjusted to reflect the
proportional scope and level of usage of such service by the Business as
compared to the Sellers or its Affiliates retained businesses), which
service shall continue (unless earlier terminated by Purchaser) for a
reasonable period of time to allow Purchaser or its Affiliates to provision
such services or procure substantially comparable services from a third party.
Further, Purchaser shall, at its sole option, and upon written notice to
Seller no less than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, have the right to
elect to not receive one or more Service that would otherwise be terminable by
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement
if it were in effect on the date hereof (i.e., any individual line item set
forth on the Services and Pricing Schedules that contains a Service fee), and
such Services and Pricing Schedules shall be updated accordingly prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the time Purchaser elects to not
receive any particular Service, it shall also elect to not receive any related
Services that are expressly identified as having to be
terminated concurrently with such Service in the Services and Pricing
Schedules. Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall discuss in good
faith reasonable requests by the other Party (i) to designate additional
related Services that must be terminated concurrently and (ii) to unbundle
separable services included as a single Service for the purpose of allowing
individual termination of such services (and the associated reduction in
prices due to any portion of such unbundled Service not being provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement). In the event that Purchaser
and Seller agree with respect to additional related Services that must be
terminated concurrently or the unbundling of separable services that may be
terminated individually (and the associated price reductions), Purchaser and
Seller will revise the Services and Pricing Schedules to reflect such
agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that
the Commingled Contracts identified on _Schedule 2.3(a)(xi)_  of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and any other Commingled Contracts that are not Real
Property Leases or Information Technology Contracts shall not be deemed to be
Purchased Assets hereunder (the " _Excluded Commingled Contracts_ "). Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to, within sixty (60) days of the date
hereof,

 



49  provide Purchaser with a list of all Material Commingled Contracts and true,
correct and complete copies of all Material Commingled Contracts and all
amendments thereto. The Parties have determined that it is advisable that the
Excluded Commingled Contracts be separated into separate Contracts between the
applicable third party and each of (i) the business retained by Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies) and (ii) the Business. The
Parties agree to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
provide reasonable assistance prior to the Closing and, to the extent not
achieved prior to the Closing, then for twelve (12) months thereafter, in
effecting the separation of such Excluded Commingled Contracts on
substantially the same terms as currently in effect or other terms reasonably
mutually agreeable to the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , it being
understood that (i) other than general internal costs, overhead and use of
internal personnel and assets or infrastructure, neither the Seller Entities,
Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be
required to expend money, incur any Liability, commence any litigation or
offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party
to separate such Contracts and (ii) in connection therewith, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including, if prior to the Closing, the
Conveyed Companies) not to, (A) commit to make any payments other than cash
payments that are Retained Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior to the
Closing or (B) make any non-monetary concession that would purport to bind
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Business or any Conveyed Company following the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, after the date
hereof, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, (i) Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts not to
enter into any Material Commingled Contract and (ii) Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend, modify or separate any Commingled
Contract in any manner that is disproportionately adverse to the Business,
Purchased Assets or any Conveyed Company as compared to Sellers other
business, assets or Affiliates. Further, subject to Section 2.11(d), with
respect to any Excluded Commingled Contract, after the Closing and for twelve
(12) months thereafter, until any separate contract (if any) is obtained
therefor the Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain for Purchaser, at no cost to Seller or Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, an arrangement with respect thereto to provide for
Purchaser substantially comparable benefits therein and to otherwise put
Purchaser and Seller (and their respective Affiliates) in the position they
would have been in had the rights and obligations relating to the Business
under such Excluded Commingled Contract been transferred at the Closing. Other
than with respect to the Retained Liabilities, Purchaser agrees to indemnify
the Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of all Liabilities of the
Seller Entities in respect of any such arrangement, continuing operations and
underlying lease, license, Contract, agreement or right. In furtherance of
the foregoing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Companies), on the one hand, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Conveyed Companies), on the other hand, receives any benefit or payment
which under any Commingled Contract was intended for the other, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, deliver such
benefit or payment to the other party.

 

(f) The Parties further acknowledge and agree that:

 

(i) With respect to the Commingled Lease in Juarez, Mexico with the Seller
identity numbers B82, G38 and RD1, (A) the portion of such Commingled Lease
with Seller identity number G38 is used in the business of the Seller and its
Affiliates other than the Business and (B) the portion of such Commingled
Lease with Seller identity 

 



50  numbers B82 and RD1 is used by the Business. The Parties have determined
that it is advisable that such Commingled Lease be separated into separate
Contracts between the applicable third party and each of (x) the business
retained by Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Conveyed Companies) and
(y) the Business. The Parties further agree to cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary consent
from the landlord to effect the separation of such Commingled Lease, splitting
the property with the Seller identity numbers B82 and RD1 into one lease and
the property with the Seller identity number G38 into another lease,
if practicable prior to Closing and on substantially the same terms as
currently in effect with respect to each such property or other terms
reasonably mutually agreeable to the Parties in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 2.7(a) - (c) (inclusive),
_mutatis mutandis_. If such split is effected prior to Closing, the lease of
the real property with the Seller identity number G38 shall not constitute
part of the Purchased Assets. If such split is not effected prior to Closing,
the lease of the real property with the Seller identity number G38 shall
constitute part of the Purchased Assets and sharing arrangements will be
addressed pursuant to the Reverse Transition Services Agreement.

 

(ii) With respect to the Commingled Lease in Bangalore, India with the Seller
identity numbers G09 and G10, (A) the portion of such Commingled Lease with
Seller identity number G10 is used in the business of the Seller and its
Affiliates other than the Business and (B) the portion of such Commingled
Lease with Seller identity number G09 is used by the Business. The Parties
have determined that it is advisable that such Commingled Lease be separated
into separate Contracts between the applicable third party and each of (x) the
business retained by Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Conveyed
Companies) and (y) the Business. The Parties further agree to cooperate and
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary
consent from the landlord to effect the separation of such Commingled
Lease, splitting the property with the Seller identity number G10 into one
lease and the property with the Seller identity number G09 into another lease,
if practicable prior to Closing and on substantially the same terms as
currently in effect or other terms reasonably mutually agreeable to the
Parties in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in Sections 2.7(a) - (c) (inclusive), _mutatis mutandis_. If such split is
effected prior to Closing, the lease of the real property with the Seller
identity number G09 shall constitute part of the Purchased Assets. If such
split is not effected prior to Closing, the lease of the real property with
the Seller identity number G09 shall not constitute part of the Purchased
Assets and sharing arrangements will be addressed pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement.

Section 2.8 Closing Date Payment; Purchase Price.

(a) _Closing Date Payment_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, in consideration of the sale and transfer of the
Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets, Purchaser agrees to assume the
Assumed Liabilities, and, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver (or
cause to be delivered) to Seller by wire transfer to one or more bank
accounts designated at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
in writing by Seller, an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Aggregate
Purchase Price in U.S. dollars. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if any portion of the Estimated Aggregate

 



51  Purchase Price is required under applicable Law to be paid in a Foreign
Currency and/or to a specific Seller Entity, the applicable U.S. dollar amount
(as allocated pursuant to Section 2.10 or otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties) shall be converted into the applicable Foreign Currency at the
Exchange Rate determined by Section 1.2(l) and paid by Purchaser or its
Permitted Designee to Seller or the appropriate Seller Entity by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in writing by Seller in lieu of the payment of such
amount in U.S. dollars pursuant to this Section 2.8(a).

 

(b) _Closing Statement_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser for its review a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good faith
estimate of each of the following, as of the Effective Time: (i) the Closing
Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash Amount (and reasonable supporting
detail and the calculation thereof), (iii) the Debt Adjustment Amount and (iv)
the Aggregate Purchase Price based on the foregoing estimates (the "
_Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price_ "), in each case, together with
supporting documentation used by Seller in calculating such amount and such
other documentation as Purchaser may reasonably request. Seller shall give
Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access to the premises, books
and records, and appropriate personnel of the Business, the Conveyed Companies
and Seller reasonably requested by Purchaser for purposes of reviewing and
evaluating the Closing Statement, and estimates set forth thereon, as
Purchaser may reasonably request. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the Specified Accounting Principles and, in the case
of Working Capital, the Working Capital Methodology.

 

(c) _Aggregate Purchase Price_. The final aggregate purchase price shall be an
amount equal to $3.0 billion (the " _Purchase Price_ ") as adjusted for the
following adjustments, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9(a) (as so
adjusted, the " _Aggregate Purchase Price_ "):

 

(i) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which
Closing Working Capital exceeds an amount equal to 102% of Base Working
Capital, or decreased by the amount, if any, by which Closing Working Capital
is less than an amount equal to 98% of Base Working Capital;

 

(ii) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the Closing Cash Amount;

 

(iii) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the Shared Service Employee
Amount;

 

(iv) The Purchase Price shall be decreased by the aggregate amount, as of the
Effective Time, of the sum of (A) the Assumed Debt Amount and (B) the
Indebtedness Amount (collectively, the " _Debt Adjustment Amount_ ").

Section 2.9 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Determination of Aggregate Purchase Price

 

(i) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than forty-
five (45) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser for its review a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Sellers good faith

 



52  calculation of each of the following, as of the Effective Time: (A) the
Closing Working Capital, (B) the Closing Cash Amount, (C) the Debt Adjustment
Amount and (D) the Aggregate Purchase Price based on the foregoing, in each
case, together with supporting documentation used by Seller in calculating
such amount and such other documentation as Purchaser may reasonably request.
The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Specified Accounting Principles and, in the case of the Working Capital, the
Working Capital Methodology. Purchaser shall give Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access to the premises, books and records, and
appropriate personnel of the Business, the Conveyed Companies and Purchaser
reasonably requested by Seller for purposes of the preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.9(a)(i) during the
periods contemplated by Section 2.9(a)(ii). Purchaser shall instruct its
employees (including the Transferred Employees) and Representatives to
cooperate with, and promptly and completely respond to all reasonable requests
and inquiries of, Seller and its Representatives, and, upon execution of a
customary access letter if required by Purchasers outside accountants, to
provide Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable
notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by Purchaser or its Affiliates or its Representatives (including its
outside accountants) to the extent such materials have been prepared by
Purchaser or its Affiliates or its Representatives and relate to the
calculation of Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash Amount and/or the
Debt Adjustment Amount in any respect (all such information shall be deemed
Confidential Information of Purchaser and therefore subject to Section
5.17(b)).

(ii) Seller shall instruct its employees and Representatives to cooperate
with, and promptly and completely respond to all reasonable requests and
inquiries of, Purchaser and its Representatives, and, upon execution of a
customary access letter if required by Sellers outside accountants, to
provide Purchaser and its Representatives with reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared by Seller or its Representatives (including its outside
accountants) to the extent such materials have been prepared by Seller or its
Representatives and relate to the calculation of Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Cash Amount and/or the Debt Adjustment Amount in any respect or
questions concerning or disagreements with the Post-Closing Statement arising
in the course of Purchasers review (all such information shall be deemed
Confidential Information of Seller and therefore subject to Section 5.17(c)).
Purchaser shall complete its review of the Post-Closing Statement within
ninety (90) days after the delivery thereof to Purchaser. Promptly following
completion of its review (but in no event later than the conclusion of the
ninety (90) day period), Purchaser may submit to Seller a letter regarding its
concurrence or disagreement with the accuracy of the Post-Closing Statement;
provided that any such letter must specify (A) the items of the Post-Closing
Statement with which Purchaser disagrees, (B) the adjustments that Purchaser
proposes to be made to the Post-Closing Statement (a " _Disputed Item_ ") and
(C) the specific amount of such disagreement and all relevant supporting
documentation and calculations; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser
may only disagree with the Post-Closing Statement (x) to the extent Purchaser
claims Seller did not prepare the Post-Closing Statement in a manner
consistent with this Agreement, the Specified Accounting Principles or the
Working Capital Methodology and (y) if Purchasers proposed calculation will
result in a

 



53  payment pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(iv) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Purchasers proposed calculation would not result in a payment pursuant to
Section 2.9(a)(iv) below, Purchaser may still disagree with the Post-Closing
Statement to the extent that Purchasers proposed calculation would affect
Purchasers rights or obligations under this Agreement with respect to
indemnification or the scope of Purchased Assets, Excluded Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Retained Liabilities. If Purchaser does not deliver a letter
disagreeing with the accuracy of the Post-Closing Statement before the
conclusion of such ninety (90) day period, then, absent fraud, the Post-
Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the Parties and Purchaser
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Post-Closing Statement. If Purchaser does deliver such a letter, following
such delivery, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve
promptly any disagreement as to the computation of any item in the Post-
Closing Statement. Any items as to which there is no disagreement shall be
deemed agreed. If a resolution of such disagreement has not been effected
within fifteen (15) days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties) after
delivery of such letter, then Seller and Purchaser shall submit any Disputed
Item to the Arbiter for determination. Promptly after such matter is referred
to the Arbiter, Seller and Purchaser shall deliver to the Arbiter copies of
any schedules or documentation that may reasonably be required by the Arbiter
to make its determination. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to
submit to the Arbiter a memorandum setting forth its position with respect to
such arbitration. The determination of the Arbiter with respect to any
Disputed Item shall be completed within thirty (30) days of submission of
such Disputed Item to the Arbiter and shall be determined in accordance with
this Agreement and be final and binding upon Seller, the Seller Entities and
Purchaser and its Permitted Designees and, absent fraud, shall be upheld as
long as the Arbiter proceeds in good faith and without bias. The Arbiter
shall adopt a position within the range of positions submitted by Seller and
Purchaser with respect to any Disputed Item. The Arbiters determination
regarding any Disputed Item shall be based solely on whether Seller included
such Disputed Item in or excluded such Disputed Item from the Post-Closing
Statement or calculated such Disputed Item, as the case may be, in a manner
consistent with this Agreement, the Specified Accounting Principles and the
Working Capital Methodology. Closing Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance herewith shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Working
Capital_ ". The fees, costs, and expenses of the Arbiter shall be shared as
follows:

(A) if the Arbiter resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Purchasers
position (the Final Aggregate Purchase Price so determined is referred to
herein as the " _Low Value_ "), then Seller shall be obligated to pay for all
of the fees and expenses of the Arbiter;

 

(B) if the Arbiter resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Sellers
position (the Final Aggregate Purchase Price so determined is referred to
herein as the " _High Value_ "), then Purchaser shall be obligated to pay for
all of the fees and expenses of the Arbiter; and

 

(C) if the Arbiter neither resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of
Purchasers position nor resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of
Sellers position

 



54  (the Final Aggregate Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as
the " _Actual Value_ "), Seller shall be responsible for such fraction of the
fees and expenses of the Arbiter equal to (x) the difference between the High
Value and the Actual Value over (y) the difference between the High Value and
the Low Value, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the remainder of the
fees and expenses of the Arbiter. 

(iii) Seller shall, if necessary, revise the Post-Closing Statement to reflect
the final determination of the Aggregate Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 2.9(a)(ii) (as adjusted, the " _Final Aggregate Purchase Price_ ").

 

(iv) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price, (A) if the Final Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds
the Estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the entire amount of such excess or (B) if the Estimated
Aggregate Purchase Price exceeds the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, then
Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the entire amount of such
excess.

(v) Any payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(iv) shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, within five (5) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Aggregate Purchase Price in U.S.
dollars or, to the extent required under applicable Law to be paid in a
Foreign Currency, such applicable U.S. dollar amount shall be converted into
the applicable Foreign Currency at the Exchange Rate determined in accordance
with Section 1.2(l) and paid in lieu of such U.S. dollar amount. Any payment
made pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(iv) shall be made with simple interest (such
interest to be calculated on the basis of a year of three-hundred sixty (360)
days and the actual number of days elapsed) on such amount from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per
annum.

 

(b) _Pension Adjustment_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the completion of the transfer of
assets contemplated by Section 5.5(m) and the assumption of Dedicated
Retirement Plans contemplated by Section 5.5(n), but in no event more than one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Pension
Statement_ ") that sets forth (together with information to demonstrate how it
determined such amount) the amount, if any, (the " _Preliminary Closing
Pension Deficit Amount_ ") by which (A) the sum of (1) the Deemed Pension
Liabilities plus (2) all Assumed Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities determined as of
the Closing Date (even if related to a Commingled Retirement Plan in a Delayed
Transfer Country where actual Assumed Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities may be
based on a determination made as of a Delayed Transfer Closing) and determined
(x) on a projected benefit obligation basis with respect to defined benefit
plans and (y) on an accrued benefit basis with respect to any defined
contribution plan, in each case regardless of whether benefits are vested or
unvested, and, for purposes of this calculation, regardless of the amount of
(or timing of the assumption of) Assumed Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities actually
assumed under Section 5.5(m), plus (3) the amount of all Liabilities
(determined

 



55  as of the Closing Date (x) on a projected benefit obligation basis with
respect to defined benefit plans and (y) on an accrued benefit basis with
respect to any defined contribution plan, in each case regardless of whether
benefits are vested or unvested) under all Dedicated Retirement Plans (the
Liabilities in clauses (2) and (3), collectively, the " _Pension Liabilities_
") exceeds (B) the sum of (1) the fair market value as of the Closing Date of
the assets (if any) of the Dedicated Retirement Plans which are transferred
with the Dedicated Retirement Plans, _plus_ (2) the fair market value of the
assets (if any) that have been transferred to the Purchaser Non-U.S.
Retirement Plans pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.5(m) within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, valued, in each case, as
of the close of business on the date of transfer, _plus_ (3) any assets that
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Companies) irrevocably
commits before the Closing Date to, and does, contribute to a Dedicated
Retirement Plan pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.5(n), within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, valued, in each case, as
of the close of business on the date of transfer (such sum of (1) plus (2)
plus (3), the " _Pension Asset Amount_ "). In the event that (A) pursuant to,
and in accordance with, Section 5.5(n), Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than the Conveyed Companies) irrevocably commits before the Closing Date to
contribute assets to one of the Dedicated Retirement Plans and such assets
are contributed to such Dedicated Retirement Plan after one hundred eighty
(180) days following the Closing Date but prior to one (1) year after the
Closing Date, or (B) pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.5(m),
assets or additional assets are transferred from a Commingled Retirement Plan
to the applicable corresponding Purchaser Non-US Retirement Plan after one
hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date but prior to one (1)
year after the Closing Date, then Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries shall
pay Seller or one of its Affiliates (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller), as applicable, as soon
as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days) after receipt of
appropriate verification of the occurrence of such contribution or transfer,
an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount equal to (A) plus (B), with
the value of such assets, in each case, determined as of the close of business
on the date of transfer, and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the Final Pension
Deficit Amount. In the event that assets required to be transferred pursuant
to Section 5.5(m) with respect to any Delayed Transfer Country are transferred
to a Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan following (1) year after the Closing
Date, then Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries shall pay Seller or one of
its Affiliates (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Seller), as applicable, as soon as practicable (but in
any event within thirty (30) days) after receipt of appropriate verification
of the occurrence of such contribution or transfer, an amount equal to the
value of such transferred assets determined as of the close of business on the
date of transfer. For purposes of this subsection (b)(i), Pension
Liabilities (including the Assumed Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities) and the
Pension Asset Amount shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology
and assumptions set forth on _Schedule E_. In connection with Sellers
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Pension Statement, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Conveyed Companies to, provide reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to their employees and all
work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents which are relevant to
the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Pension Statement (which access
shall be provided promptly after request by Seller and/or its
Representatives).

 



56 (A) Purchaser shall have a period of sixty (60) days following delivery
of the Preliminary Closing Pension Statement and supporting materials in
accordance with subsection (b)(i) above during which to review the Preliminary
Closing Pension Deficit Amount calculation and supporting materials and to
notify Seller if it believes the calculation of the Preliminary Closing
Pension Deficit Amount contains mathematical errors, is based on actuarial or
other assumptions inconsistent with the principles set forth in subsection
(b)(i) above, or otherwise was not performed in accordance with the
principles set forth in subsection (b)(i) above.

(B) If Purchaser shall fail to so notify Seller of any such dispute before
the end of such sixty (60) day period, then the Preliminary Closing Pension
Deficit Amount shall be the " _Final Pension Deficit Amount_."

 

(C) If Purchaser shall so notify Seller of any such dispute before the end of
such sixty (60) day period, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible, and the amount so
determined by Purchaser and Seller upon resolution, if any, of such dispute
shall be the " _Final Pension Deficit Amount_." In connection with
Purchasers review of the Preliminary Closing Pension Statement, Seller shall
provide reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to its employees and all work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared or reviewed by Seller or any of its employees and
accountants or other Representatives during the course of its review which are
relevant to the Preliminary Closing Pension Statement (which access shall be
provided promptly after request by Purchaser and/or its Representatives).

(ii) If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve such dispute with respect to any
jurisdiction within sixty (60) days after notice by Purchaser of the dispute,
Seller and Purchaser shall choose an independent actuary ( _i.e._ , an
actuarial firm that is nationally recognized in such jurisdiction other
than any actuary regularly used by Seller or Purchaser or that assisted
Purchaser in any dispute initiated by Purchaser pursuant to subsection
(b)(i)(C) above); _provided_ , that if Seller and Purchaser cannot mutually
agree on the identity of an independent actuary within five (5) Business
Days, then Seller and Purchaser shall on the next Business Day each identify
an actuarial firm (other than one regularly used by Seller or Purchaser or
that assisted Purchaser in any dispute initiated by Purchaser pursuant to
subsection Section 2.9(b)(i)(C) above), and the independent actuary shall be
selected by lot from these two firms, and provided further that if such
actuary identified by lot shall not agree to serve within five (5) Business
Days after being so selected, then additional actuarial firms shall be
identified in accordance with the foregoing procedures until one shall agree
to serve (such independent actuary determined in accordance with
this parenthetical, an " _Independent Actuary_ "). Seller and Purchaser shall
require any Independent Actuary to determine, as of the Effective Time and
based solely on the principles set forth in subsection (b)(i) above (and
without regard to any determination whether such principles are appropriate
to the circumstances), the amount of (A) the Deemed Pension Liabilities, (B)
the Pension Liabilities and (C) the Pension

 



57  Asset Amount, in each case with respect to the plan(s) in relation to which
such Independent Actuary was engaged. Seller and Purchaser shall instruct the
Independent Actuary to use every reasonable commercial effort to perform its
services within thirty (30) days after submission of the Preliminary Closing
Pension Statement and supporting materials to it and, in any case, as promptly
as practicable after submission. The determination of an Independent Actuary
shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser and the amount of the
excess (if any) of (A) the sum of (x) the Deemed Pension Liabilities and (y)
the Pension Liabilities over (B) the Pension Asset Amount, as so determined
by the Independent Actuary shall be the " _Final Pension Deficit Amount_."

 

(iii) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Pension Deficit Amount, (A) if the Final Pension Deficit Amount exceeds the
Reference Pension Amount, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to the entire amount of such excess plus 50% of the amount of all Taxes or
other surcharges payable by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the extent
they are required by applicable Law to make any contribution of any amounts to
the Dedicated Retirement Plans or the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plans in
connection with the assumption of Liabilities thereunder as set forth in
this Agreement as applicable, or (B) if the Reference Pension Amount exceeds
the Final Pension Deficit Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the entire amount of such excess minus 50% of the amount of all Taxes
or other surcharges payable by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the
extent they are required by applicable Law to make any contribution of any
amounts to the Dedicated Retirement Plans or the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement
Plans as applicable in connection with the assumption of Liabilities
thereunder as set forth in this Agreement as applicable. Any payments to be
made pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(iii) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be, in U.S. dollars or, to the extent required
under applicable Law to be paid in a Foreign Currency, such applicable U.S.
dollar amount shall be converted into the applicable Foreign Currency at the
Exchange Rate determined by Section 1.2(l) and paid in lieu of such U.S.
dollar amount. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(iii) shall be
made with simple interest (such interest to be calculated on the basis of a
year of three-hundred sixty (360) days and the actual number of days elapsed)
on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate
equal to five percent (5%) per annum.

 

Section 2.10 Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller, on behalf of itself and
the Equity Selling Entities and the Asset Selling Entities, and Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and any Permitted Designee, have agreed to allocate the Final
Aggregate Purchase Price, the amount of Assumed Liabilities and other relevant
amounts among the Equity Interests (and to the extent required or
permitted by applicable Tax Law, the underlying assets held by Conveyed
Companies) and the Purchased Assets (and to the extent required or permitted
by applicable Tax Law, the non-competition covenant contained in Section 5.15
and any licenses acquired pursuant to this Agreement) (collectively, the
"Section 2.10 Assets"), in a manner consistent with Sections 1060 and 338 of
the Code (as applicable) (and any other applicable Tax Law) and the
methodology set forth in _Schedule B_ (the " _Allocation Methodology_ ").
Purchaser and Seller shall

 



58  agree on a preliminary allocation of the Purchase Price, the Assumed
Liabilities and other relevant amounts (the " _Asset Allocation_ ") prior to
the Closing Date among the Section 2.10 Assets, in a manner consistent with
Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code (and any other applicable Tax Law), the
Allocation Methodology and this Section 2.10 and based on the information
available as of the Balance Sheet Date. Within ninety (90) Business Days
after the Post-Closing Statement becomes final pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(ii),
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Allocation_ "),
allocating the Final Aggregate Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities and
other relevant amounts, to the extent properly taken into account under
Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code (as applicable) (and any other applicable
Tax Law)) among the Section 2.10 Assets in accordance with Sections 1060 and
338 of the Code (as applicable) (and any other applicable Tax Law).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree
that the Allocation will be consistent with the methodologies, policies
and principles of the Allocation Methodology and the Asset Allocation;
_provided_ that the Allocation shall reflect any adjustments since the Balance
Sheet Date. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Seller
Entities on the one hand and Purchaser, the Permitted Designees and the
Conveyed Companies on the other shall (i) be bound by the Allocation for
purposes of determining any Taxes; (ii) prepare and file, and cause its
Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
the Allocation (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) and (iii) take
no position inconsistent with the Allocation, and cause its Affiliates to take
no position inconsistent with the Allocation, on any applicable Tax Return or
in any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise, in each case,
except as otherwise required pursuant to a Final Determination. In the event
that the Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party (or its
Affiliate) receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
Party hereto, and Seller and Purchaser agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to defend such Allocation in any Contest. In the event that an
adjustment to the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is made pursuant to this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment resulting
from any actions pursuant to the Restructuring that occur after finalization
of the Post-Closing Statement as provided in Section 5.20 or any change in
the Equity Interests or the Purchased Assets or other Section 2.10 Assets
among which the Final Aggregate Purchase Price is allocated pursuant to this
Section 2.10 resulting from any actions pursuant to the Restructuring that
occur after finalization of the Post-Closing Statement as provided in Section
5.20), Purchaser and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to
mutually agree to an allocation of any such post-Closing adjustment in
a manner consistent with the Allocation and this Section 2.10. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties shall respect the Allocation agreed upon
pursuant to this Section 2.10 with respect to the Purchased Assets sold by the
Asset Selling Entities that are organized in the Peoples Republic of China
and for the sale of Equity Interests of the Chinese Entities and in no event
shall the Parties adjust the Allocation with respect to such Purchased Assets
or Equity Interests.

 

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall each instruct their employees and
Representatives to cooperate with, and promptly respond to all
reasonable requests and inquiries of, the other, and to provide, upon
execution of a customary access letter if required by Sellers or Purchasers
(as applicable) outside accountants, Purchaser and its Representatives or
Seller and its Representatives (as applicable) with reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared by the other to the extent such materials have been
prepared and relate to the Allocation in any respect or questions concerning
or disagreements with the Allocation. Purchaser shall notify Seller of any

 



59  disagreement with the proposed Allocation within twenty (20) Business Days
after Purchasers receipt of the proposed Allocation. If Seller and Purchaser
fail to agree on the Allocation within 30 days after Sellers receipt of
Purchasers notice of disagreement (or if Seller and Purchaser fail to agree
on the allocation of any post-Closing adjustment to the Final Aggregate
Purchase Price), such matter shall be referred to the Arbiter for binding
arbitration. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that the dispute
resolution provisions set forth in Section 7.10 of this Agreement shall apply
to any dispute addressed by this Section 2.10.

 

Section 2.11 Closing.

 

(a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, at 10:00 A.M., Eastern

61 ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Except as set forth in the letter (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ")
delivered by Seller to Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (it being understood that any matter disclosed on any Schedule of
the Seller Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed on any other
Schedule of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face), Seller hereby represents and warrants to
Purchaser as follows:

Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification. Seller is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing under the Laws of Switzerland and is duly
qualified and in good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) under the
laws of each jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where
the lack of such qualification or standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed
Companies and the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. Each Equity Selling
Entity and Asset Selling Entity is a corporation, limited liability company or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (or local
legal equivalent, if any) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and is duly qualified and in good standing (or local legal
equivalent, if any) under the laws of each jurisdiction where such
qualification is required, except where the lack of such qualification or
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the Purchased
Assets, taken as a whole. Each Equity Selling Entity and Asset Selling Entity
has full corporate, company or partnership power and authority to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold the Purchased Assets owned, leased or
otherwise held by it and to conduct the Business as presently conducted by it.

 

Section 3.2 Corporate Authority; Binding Effect.

 

(a) Seller has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is
a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Prior to
Closing, each other Seller Entity and Conveyed Company shall have all
requisite corporate or other power and authority to execute and deliver each
Transaction Document to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery by Seller and each other Seller Entity
and Conveyed Company party to this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to be executed and delivered by Seller and such other Seller
Entities or Conveyed Companies, and the performance by Seller, and such other
Seller Entities and Conveyed Companies of their respective obligations
hereunder and thereunder, have been, or will have been at the Closing, duly
authorized by all requisite corporate or other entity action on the part of
Seller and such other Seller Entities and the Conveyed Companies. No other
corporate or other proceedings on the part of the Seller is necessary
to authorize this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all other
corporate or other proceedings on the part of other Seller Entities or
Conveyed Companies necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby shall have occurred prior to Closing.

 



62 (b) This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to be executed by
Seller or the other Seller Entities or Conveyed Companies, when executed and
delivered by Seller or such other Seller Entity or Conveyed Company, assuming
due execution and delivery hereof by the other parties thereto, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller, the other Seller Entities
and Conveyed Companies party thereto, enforceable against Seller and such
other Seller Entities and Conveyed Companies in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Section 3.3 Conveyed Companies; Capital Structure.

 

(a) Each of the Conveyed Companies is duly organized, validly existing, in
good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) and, where applicable, duly
qualified under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except in
jurisdictions where the failure to be in good standing (or local legal
equivalent, if any) would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the
Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, with the requisite power and authority to
own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
currently conducted. Each of the Conveyed Companies is duly qualified to do
business and in good standing (or local legal equivalent, if any) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or properties makes such
qualification necessary, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the Purchased
Assets, taken as a whole. With respect to any individual who would have
been considered a Business Employee or Shared Service Employee as of December
31, 2014 and taking into account certain terminations of employment after such
date, _Schedule 3.3(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth, as
of January 22, 2015, his or her aggregate value of Unvested Grants (assuming
an underlying per share price of $64.00) and the underlying equity award
giving rise thereto, the incentive plan under which such award was issued, the
type of such award, the date of grant thereof, the exercise price therefor
(as applicable) and the vesting schedule therefor (and the aggregate value of
all Unvested Grants). For purposes of calculating the amount of pro-rata
vesting of the Unvested Grants,  _Schedule 3.3(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter assumes that the transaction occurs on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and assumes, in connection therewith, a January 31, 2015 termination
date with respect to each Business Employee and Shared Service Employee.

(b) _Schedule 3.3(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the
authorized capitalization of the Conveyed Companies and the number of shares
of each class of capital stock or other equity interests in each such Conveyed
Company outstanding and the record holders thereof. All shares of each class
of capital stock or other equity interests of each Conveyed Company (i) are
duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding and (to the extent applicable)
fully paid and non-assessable and (ii) were not issued in violation of any
right of first refusal, preemptive or similar rights and offered and issued
in compliance with all applicable state and federal securities Laws. Except
for the Equity Interests or as reflected on _Schedule 3.3(b)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, there are no shares of common stock, preferred stock or
other equity interests or phantom stock, stock appreciation rights or other
similar rights of any of the Conveyed Companies, authorized, reserved, issued
or outstanding and no outstanding 

 



63  warrants, options, agreements, subscriptions, preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal, anti-dilution rights or other rights (contingent or otherwise),
convertible or exchangeable securities or other Contracts pursuant to which
any of the Conveyed Companies is or may become obligated to issue, sell,
transfer, purchase, return or redeem any shares of capital stock or other
securities or other equity interests of the Conveyed Companies, or other
agreements affecting or relating to the voting, issuance or transfer of the
capital stock or equity of any Conveyed Company, and no equity securities or
other equity interests of any of the Conveyed Companies are reserved for
issuance for any purpose. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(b)(ii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter or for minority equity investments with a book value
as of the Balance Sheet Date not to exceed $1,000,000 (individually or in the
aggregate) that do not include an obligation to (x) contribute to the capital
of, lend money in lieu of a contribution to the capital of, or invest in any
Person, (y) acquire or enter into any Contract to acquire, any equity interest
or securities of any Person or (z) conduct any business through any Person or
divert or provide any corporate opportunity to any Person, none of the
Conveyed Companies (i) own any equity interests (or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable therefor) of any other Person other than another
Conveyed Company as indicated on _Schedule 3.3(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, all of which are owned of record and beneficially by such Conveyed
Company free and clear of all Liens (except for Liens that will be released
in full prior to the Closing and Liens created by or as a result of the acts
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) or (ii) have any obligation to
contribute to the capital of, lend money in lieu of a contribution to
the capital of, or invest in any Person, or have any Contract to acquire, any
equity interest or securities of any Person. There are no Contracts to which
any Equity Selling Entity or Conveyed Company, or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
any other Person is a party with respect to the voting (including proxies or
voting trust agreements), ownership, transfer or registration of the equity
interests of the Conveyed Company and there is no Indebtedness providing for
the right to vote (or convertible into securities that have the right to
vote) on any matters on which holders of capital stock or other equity
interests in the Conveyed Company may vote. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
Conveyed Company is in breach of its organizational documents that would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the
Business or the Conveyed Companies, taken as a whole. At Closing there will be
no material Liability for, or obligation with respect to, any dividends
or distributions declared or accumulated but unpaid with respect to any
shares of the capital stock or other equity interests of any Conveyed Company.

 

(c) The Equity Selling Entities own of record and beneficially all of the
outstanding Equity Interests of the Conveyed Entities, free and clear of all
Liens (except for Liens that will be released in full prior to the Closing and
Liens created by or as a result of the acts of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates).

 

Section 3.4 Governmental Authorization. Except as required solely by reason of
the identity and other facts or matters relating to Purchaser or the
Permitted Designees, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents by Seller, the other Seller Entities and
the Conveyed Companies, as applicable, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than as set forth
on _Schedule 3.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and any such other action or
filing as to which the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the Business, the
Conveyed Companies and the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole.

 



64 Section 3.5 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Seller, the other
Seller Entities and the Conveyed Companies party thereto, as applicable, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not
and will not (with or without notice or lapse of time or both): (a) violate,
conflict with, or result in any breach of any provision of the Constituent
Documents of Seller or any of the Equity Selling Entities, the Asset Selling
Entities or the Conveyed Companies party thereto, as applicable; (b) subject
to obtaining the consents referred to on _Schedule 3.4_ and _Schedule 3.5_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute
a default under, require any waiver, approval or consent under, or result in
the termination, cancellation or acceleration (whether after the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both) of any right or obligation of the Seller
Entities or the Conveyed Companies under, or to a loss of any benefit of the
Business to which the Seller Entities or the Conveyed Companies are entitled
under, any Material Contract or Real Property Lease, (c) assuming all actions
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority set forth on
_Schedule 3.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter have been made or obtained,

Purchased Assets, any Seller Entity or Conveyed Company is subject or (d)
result in the imposition or creation of any Lien upon the Equity Interests,
any Purchased Assets or any assets of the Conveyed Companies, other than a
Permitted Lien upon any Purchased Assets or any assets of the Conveyed
Companies; except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d), for any
violations, breaches, conflicts, defaults, terminations, cancellations or
accelerations as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.6 Permits. Seller and its Affiliates have obtained each Permit of
the Asset Selling Entities and the Conveyed Companies necessary for the
conduct of the Business as it is currently conducted, except where the failure
to possess any such Permit would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and
the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. Each Asset Selling Entity and each
Conveyed Company is in compliance with all of the terms and requirements of
each such Permit, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and
the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. Each of such Permits is valid, in full
force and effect and has not been revoked, reversed, stayed, set aside,
annulled or suspended and there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened relating to the suspension, revocation, non-renewal or
modification of any such Permits or which questions or contests the validity
of the rights under any such Permit nor is there any reasonable basis for the
revocation, cancellation, suspension, adverse modification, non-renewal or
declaration of invalidity of any such Permit, other than exceptions to any of
the foregoing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the
Purchased Assets, taken as a whole. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6_  of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Material Permits, to the extent contemplated
to be transferred to, or retained by (as applicable), Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall remain in full force and effect immediately after the Closing
without any material additional cost to Purchaser or its Affiliates or any
material additional restriction, condition or filing, and there are no facts
or circumstances that are reasonably likely to prevent, or materially increase
the cost after Closing of, complying with such Permits. _Schedule 3.6_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the Sellers and its Affiliates Material
Permits as of the date hereof. As used herein,

 



65  " _Material Permit_ " shall mean any Permit material for the conduct of the
Business as it is currently conducted other than those that would reasonably
be expected by Seller (without investigation or knowledge as to any
particularized circumstances of Purchaser) to be able to be obtained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in the ordinary course of business without
significant delay or expense.

 

Section 3.7 Absence of Certain Changes. Since September 26, 2014 to the date
of this Agreement and other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents: (a) the Business has been
conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course and consistent with
past practice; (b) there has not occurred a Material Adverse Effect; and (c)
none of Seller, any Equity Selling Entity, any Asset Selling Entity or any
Conveyed Company has taken (or omitted to take) any action that would
constitute a breach or require waiver of (i) any provision of
Sections 5.2(a)(ii), 5.2(a)(iii), 5.2(a)(vii), 5.2(a)(viii), 5.2(a)(xi),
5.2(a)(xii), 5.2(a)(xiv), 5.2(a)(xvii), 5.2(a)(xviii) or 5.2(a)(xix) if taken
(or omitted to be taken) after the date hereof but before the Closing or (ii)
the second sentence of Section 5.5(n) if taken (or omitted to be taken) after
the date hereof. Purchaser acknowledges that there may be disruption to the
operation of the Business as a result of the announcement by the Seller of its
intention to sell the Business (and there may be further disruption to the
Business as a result of the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby) and Purchaser agrees that any such

reasonably expected to be material to the Business, the Conveyed Companies and
the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole.

(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
the Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans.

 

(c) Each Business Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify for Tax-

Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the

Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable in the

defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or (y) a plan described in Section 4063(a)
of ERISA. As of the date of this Agreement, there has been no amendment to,
written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Seller or
any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Business Benefit Plan which (A) with respect to any

expense of maintaining such Benefit Plan or (B) with respect to Business
Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Plans or Conveyed Company Benefit Plans,

above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the twelve
(12) months ended as of the date of the Financial Statements.

(d) Whenever applicable according to the Laws and regulations of the

compensation or any other payment or compensation or result in any other

86 Section 4.5 Financial Capability

 

(a) On the Closing Date, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and the funding of the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments on the
Closing Date, Purchaser will have sufficient funds to pay the Estimated
Aggregate Purchase Price and to otherwise consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement at the Closing and to pay all related fees
and expenses payable by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement at or in connection with the Closing.

 

(b) Purchaser has received a duly executed commitment letter, dated as of
January 27, 2015 (collectively with the Redacted Fee Letter, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), from (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (" _JPMCB_ ") and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC (" _JPMorgan_ "), (ii) Bank of America, N.A. (" _Bank of
America_ ") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith (" _MLPF andS_"), (iii)
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (" _DBNY_ "), Deutsche Bank Cayman Island
Branch (" _DBCI_ ") and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (" _DBSI_ ") and (iv)
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (" _Wells Fargo Bank_ ") and Wells
Fargo Securities, LLC (" _Wells Fargo Securities_ " and, together with JPMCB,
JPMorgan, Bank of America, MLPFandS, DBNY, DBCI, DBSI and Wells Fargo Bank,
together with any other entities that have, directly or indirectly, committed
to provide or arrange or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with
all or any part of the Debt Financing or other financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties to any joinder
agreements, indentures or credit agreements entered into pursuant thereto or
relating thereto, each a " _Financing Source_ ," and, collectively, the "
_Financing Sources_ "), a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit F_,
pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed on a several but not
joint basis, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to
Purchaser with debt financing up to an aggregate amount set forth therein (the
" _Debt Financing_ "). The copies of the Financing Commitments attached hereto
as _Exhibit F_ are true, accurate and complete copies of the Financing
Commitments as in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than with
respect to the redacted portions of the Redacted Fee Letter). As of the date
hereof, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended,
modified, terminated or withdrawn (and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no
such amendment, modification, termination or withdrawal is contemplated). Each
Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
parties thereto, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity.
Other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, there are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing
Commitment that could adversely affect the availability of the funding in full
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates under the Financing Commitments. Purchaser has fully paid any and
all

 



87  commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be
paid on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt Financing is subject to no
conditions precedent other than those set forth in the Financing Commitments.
Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3
are satisfied at Closing and assuming compliance in all material respects by
the Seller of its obligations under this Agreement, Purchaser has no reason
to believe that (x) Purchaser will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
(taking into account the Marketing Period) any term or condition of Closing
that is required to be satisfied by it as a condition of Debt Financing being
made available to Purchaser under the Financing Commitments or (y) that the
Debt Financing will not be made available to Purchaser on the Closing Date.

acquiring the Equity Interests solely for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof.
Purchaser acknowledges that the Equity Interests are not registered under the
Securities Act, any applicable state securities Laws or any applicable
foreign securities Laws, and that such Equity Interests may not be
transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or applicable foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to applicable state securities
Laws. Purchaser (either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Equity Interests
and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

Section 4.7 Investigation by Purchaser; Sellers Liability. Purchaser has
conducted its own independent investigation, verification, review and analysis
of the operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition, technology and the probable success or profitability of the
ownership, use or operation of the Business, the Conveyed Companies and the
Purchased Assets by Purchaser after the Closing, which investigation, review
and analysis was conducted by Purchaser and, to the extent Purchaser
deemed appropriate, by its Affiliates and Purchaser Representatives.
Purchaser has selected and been represented by, and/or consulted with, such
expert advisors as it has deemed appropriate in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and its determination to enter into and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges that,
to the Knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Purchaser
Representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Business, the Conveyed Companies and
the Purchased Assets for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned
investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or
opinions of Seller or the Seller Entities and Conveyed Companies or any of
Sellers or its Affiliates Representatives (except the specific
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III), and it
acknowledges and agrees that it is otherwise acquiring the Business, the

management presentations relating to the Business made available to Purchaser,
its Affiliates

 



88  or the Purchaser Representatives, in materials made available in any "data

synergies from the transaction, financial projections or other projections,

its Affiliates or the Purchaser Representatives, whether orally or
in writing, in materials prepared by or on behalf of Seller, or in any other
form (such information, collectively, " _Due Diligence Materials_ "); and

 

(b) absent fraud, neither Seller, any Seller Entity nor any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives shall have any Liability
or responsibility whatsoever to Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Purchaser
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any Due Diligence Materials
delivered or made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Purchaser
Representatives, except that the foregoing limitations of paragraph (a) and
the limitations of this paragraph (b) shall not apply insofar as Seller makes
the specific representations and warranties set forth in Article III.

Section 4.8 No Litigation. There is no Action, Order outstanding, suit,
litigation, legal proceeding or arbitration pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened in writing, against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
by or before any Governmental Authority or arbitrator which would, if
adversely determined, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the performance by Purchaser or its Permitted Designees of their obligations
under this Agreement or the consummation of transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.9 Brokers. Except for Allen and Company LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,
finders or other fee, commission or expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Purchaser. Purchaser is solely responsible for such fees and
expenses of Allen and Company LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.

Section 4.10 Exclusivity of Representations. The representations and
warranties made by Purchaser in this Article IV are the exclusive
representations and warranties made by Purchaser with respect to Purchaser,
its Affiliates, its or their business or any other matter in connection with
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser hereby disclaims any other express
or implied representations or warranties with respect to Purchaser, its
Affiliates, its or their business or any other matter in connection
with transactions contemplated hereby. It is understood and agreed that any
due diligence materials delivered or made available to Seller or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives respecting Purchaser, its
Affiliates, their business or otherwise, do not, directly or indirectly, and
shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly, contain representations or
warranties of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

Conveyed Company which are not paid in full by Seller prior to Closing other
than liabilities arising under the terms of the Real Property Leases relating
to such Transfer To Properties or (z) renewing or extending the Real Property
Leases set forth in _Schedule 5.2(a)(xxiii) Part III_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _In Process Properties_ ") in the ordinary course of business
on terms consistent with past practice, provided that no such actions shall

in full such intercompany account in cash and (y) in no event shall the
foregoing (i) - (iii) be deemed to permit any intercompany loan or advance or
other transactions that survives the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Asset Selling Entities and
the Conveyed Companies shall be permitted to borrow funds from Seller or its
Affiliates as is necessary to operate the Business in the ordinary course
provided that all such borrowings are in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and repaid prior to or at the Closing. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, rights to control or
direct the operations of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Conveyed
Companies prior to the Closing Date. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of (x) the date this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms and (y) the Closing, except as otherwise
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall knowingly take any action or omit to take any action for the purpose of
directly or indirectly preventing, materially delaying or materially impeding
(or that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to do any of

consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the satisfaction of the
respective conditions set forth in Article VI; (ii) the obtaining of all

definition of Retained Liabilities) and (b) transferring any
employees (including Shared Service Employees) that are not Business
Employees, in each of the foregoing cases (a) and (b), from the Conveyed
Companies to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than a Conveyed Company)
such that the Conveyed Companies are transferred to Purchaser at Closing
without any such Retained Liabilities (or any Liabilities of the type
described in the definition of Retained Liabilities) or employees that are not
Business Employees, in each of the foregoing cases to the extent commercially
practicable and permitted by Law and (vii) in the case of Seller, cooperate
with Purchaser to obtain any consents required from third parties in

defined in the Transition Services Agreement). Seller shall be responsible for
any Taxes resulting from the transfers contemplated by Section 5.3(vi).
Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall permit Seller to, or to cause its Affiliates
to, without Purchasers prior written consent, commit to any divestiture
transaction, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or Purchasers ability to
retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of, the Business
contemplated to be acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as expressly set forth
in Section 5.4, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required to commit
to any divestiture transaction, or otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or
Purchasers ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of, the Business contemplated to be acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.4 Antitrust Laws.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby: (i)
as promptly as

 



97  practicable, take all actions necessary to file or cause to be filed the
filings required of it or any of its Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust
Laws; (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to
obtain the required consents from Antitrust Authorities, including antitrust

promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date; (iii) at the
earliest practicable date comply with (or properly reduce the scope of) any
formal or informal request for additional information or documentary material
received by it or any of its Affiliates from any Antitrust Authority; and
(iv) consult and cooperate with Seller, and consider in good faith the views
of Seller, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, proposals or other
written communications made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Seller
shall (x) as promptly as practicable take all actions necessary to file or
cause to be filed the filings required of it or any of its Affiliates under
any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (y) consult and cooperate with
Purchaser, and consider in good faith the views of Purchaser, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions, proposals or other written communications made or submitted by or on
behalf of any Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Laws; and (z) at the earliest practicable and advisable date comply
with (or properly reduce the scope of) any formal or informal request for
additional information or documentary material received by it or any of
its Affiliates from any Antitrust Authority. Each of the Parties will
promptly notify the other Party of any written communication made to or
received by such Party from any Antitrust Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Party will participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Antitrust Authority in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Antitrust Authority, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend, and each Party will furnish the other
Party, through its counsel, with copies of all correspondence, filings
and written communications between them and their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on one hand and any such Antitrust Authority or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such
correspondence, filings and written communications that include confidential
or proprietary information not directly related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under
any Antitrust Laws.

 

(c) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation
could reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated

 



98  hereby; (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order
on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with and without limiting
Section 5.4(a), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) use
its reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) under
any Antitrust Law that would prevent the consummation of the Closing and (ii)
not extend any waiting period with any Antitrust Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) In connection with and without limiting Section 5.4(a), Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the required approvals or
termination of any required waiting period under the Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Antitrust Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law,
including (subject to first having used all reasonable best efforts to
negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and resisting any
Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to have such Law or Order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable and (iii) to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
the Antitrust Laws, in each case so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of this Section 5.4 only, " _reasonable best efforts_ " shall
include Purchaser proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of assets of Purchaser, the Business, the Purchased Assets or any
of the Conveyed Companies or any combination thereof and otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers or
its Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to operate
and/or retain, assets of Purchaser or, to the extent contemplated to be
acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, assets of the Business, any
of the Purchased Assets or any of the Conveyed Companies or any combination
thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement will require,
or be deemed to require, Purchaser or its Affiliates to take any action that
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 5.5 Business Employees and Employee Benefits.

 

(a) The employment of each Conveyed Company Business Employee shall not
terminate upon the Closing but shall continue immediately after the Closing
with such Conveyed Company Business Employees years of service carried over,
in the same job or position and within fifty (50) miles of the location (or
such other location that will not give rise to any severance or
termination benefits), in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (x) at a rate of pay at least equal to that in effect prior
to Closing (in the aggregate, other than with respect to (A) base salary or
wages which shall be at least equal to that in effect prior to Closing and
(B) aggregate target bonus opportunity and other cash incentive compensation
opportunity, which opportunities shall be at least equal in the aggregate to
that in effect prior to Closing), (y) with severance entitlements not less
favorable than those in effect

 



99  prior to Closing (in the aggregate, other than with respect to severance
pay, which shall be at least equal to that in effect prior to Closing), and
(z) with other employee benefits, perquisites and terms and conditions of
employment (including defined benefit pension benefits, defined contribution
retirement plans, non-qualified retirement benefits, deferred compensation
arrangements, but excluding (i) liquidity, sale bonus, transaction,
retention, change-of-control, stay bonus plans or similar arrangements and
(ii) equity, stock options or equity-based compensation or awards) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other employee
benefits, perquisites and terms and conditions of employment provided to such
Conveyed Company Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and with respect to
those Conveyed Company Business Employees who are represented for purposes of
collective bargaining by a labor organization, Purchaser shall cause each such
entity to comply with and observe the terms of any collective bargaining
agreement and applicable Law, with respect to the wages, hours and other
terms and conditions of employment with respect to such employees.

(b) With regard to any Asset Selling Entity Business Employee or Offeree,
within a reasonable period of time (but not less than thirty (30) days) prior
to the Closing Date (or, in the case of an Offeree, the later of thirty (30)
days prior to the Closing Date and five (5) days after Seller notifies
Purchaser that such Offeree has received an offer of employment), Purchaser or
its Affiliates, as appropriate, shall: (i) offer employment (where employment
does not continue automatically by operation of applicable Law) to each such
Asset Selling Entity Business Employee or Offeree, commencing as of the
Closing Date (or, in the case of an Offeree, the applicable Offeree Start
Date); or (ii) continue to employ (where employment continues automatically
by operation of applicable Law) each such Asset Selling Entity Business
Employee or Offeree (and such individual does not object, where such right
exists under applicable Law) as of the Closing Date. Purchaser or its
Affiliates, as appropriate, shall immediately after the Closing employ such
Asset Selling Entity Business Employee or Offeree in the same job or position
and within fifty (50) miles of the location (or such other location that would
not give rise to any severance or termination benefits), in each case, as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of an Offeree,
in the same job or position and within fifty (50) miles of the location (or
such other location that will not give rise to any severance or termination
benefits) as would have applied to such Offeree as of the applicable Offeree
Start Date) and (x) at a rate of pay at least equal to that in effect prior to
Closing (in the aggregate, other than with respect to (A) base salary or
wages which shall be at least equal to that in effect prior to Closing and (B)
aggregate target bonus opportunity and other cash incentive compensation
opportunity, which opportunities shall be at least equal in the aggregate to
that in effect prior to Closing, (y) with severance entitlements not less
favorable than those in effect prior to Closing (in the aggregate, other than
with respect to severance pay, which shall be at least equal to that in effect
prior to Closing), and (z) with other employee benefits, perquisites and
terms and conditions of employment (including defined benefit pension
benefits, defined contribution retirement plans, non-qualified retirement
benefits, deferred compensation arrangements, but excluding (i) liquidity,
sale bonus, transaction, retention, change-of-control, stay bonus plans or
similar arrangements and (ii) equity, stock options or equity-based
compensation or awards) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Asset Selling Entity Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required under applicable local Law or
applicable collective bargaining, works council or similar labor Contract (or,
in the case of an Offeree, to which such Offeree otherwise would have been

 



100  entitled as of the applicable Offeree Start Date). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates to
assume and to comply with and observe the terms of, each and every collective
bargaining agreement, and further to comply with applicable Law, with respect
to all such Asset Selling Entity Business Employees or Offerees.

 

(c) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser
covenants and agrees to continue to provide each Transferred Employee with
the pay, severance, benefits, perquisites and terms and conditions of
employment described in Section 5.5(a) or Section 5.5(b), as applicable,
unless such Transferred Employees employment is sooner terminated
(other than in the case of severance or similar termination pay and
benefits). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
Holdings to, issue to Transferred Employees equity-based award grants that
are substantially similar to those granted to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser, Holdings and their Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _that_ , except as
provided in Section 5.5(f), a Transferred Employee shall not be granted
equity-based awards if such Transferred Employee received an equity-based
award grant from Seller within two hundred twenty-five (225) days of the grant
date of equity-based awards granted to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to (x) continue to
employ any Transferred Employee for any specific period of time following the
Closing Date or (y) other than as expressly set forth in this Section 5.5(c),
continue to provide any pay, equity-based compensation, severance, benefits,
perquisites or terms and conditions of employment for any period after the
Closing. For purposes of this Section 5.5, "pay" shall include base salary or
wages plus any commission rates, variable pay target bonus opportunity, cash
incentive compensation opportunity, premium pay opportunity, overtime rates or
shift differential rates, but shall specifically exclude liquidity, change of
control, sale bonus, transaction, retention, change-of-control or stay
bonuses, equity, stock options and other equity-based awards. Purchaser, at
the time such employment offers are so extended, shall provide to Seller
appropriate information regarding employment terms and conditions offered to
the Asset Selling Entity Business Employees and Offerees, which shall conform
in all respects to the provisions of this Section 5.5. Purchaser shall consult
with Seller prior to the extension of employment offers with respect to
communicating the offers to the Asset Selling Entity Business Employees and
Offerees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, actions
taken by Seller or its Affiliates in accordance with Section
5.2(a)(iii)(D)(y) (other than actions taken by the Seller or its Affiliates
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with respect
to pay and health and welfare benefits) shall be disregarded for all purposes
of determining Purchasers obligations under Section 5.5(a), Section 5.5(b),
Section 5.5(c), Section 5.5(d) or Section 5.5(e)(i).

(d)  _Provision of Health Benefits; Certain Welfare Plan Matters_. Effective
commencing on the applicable Transition Date for each Transferred Employee,
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided coverage to such Transferred
Employee and their respective spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under a
group health plan sponsored by Purchaser. With respect to such health plan and
any other welfare benefit plans of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in which
Transferred Employees are eligible to participate, Purchaser shall, except as
would result

 



101  in the duplication of benefits, use reasonable best efforts to (i) ensure
that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-
existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health exclusions are
applicable to the Transferred Employees or their spouses, dependents or
beneficiaries, and (ii) provide or cause to be provided that any costs or
expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees (and their respective spouses,
dependents and beneficiaries) up to (and including) the applicable Transition
Date for deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions
and like adjustments or limitations on coverage shall be specifically applied
for such purposes under any such health or welfare benefit plans for the plan
year in which such Transition Date occurs. Without limiting the generality of
Section 2.4(h), Purchaser shall be responsible under the employee welfare
benefit plans of Purchaser for all amounts payable by reason of claims
incurred by Transferred Employees and their eligible spouses, dependents and
beneficiaries after the applicable Transition Date. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 2.4(h), with respect to any Business Benefit Plans
providing employee welfare and fringe benefits, Seller shall fully perform,
pay and discharge, under such Business Benefit Plans, all claims of
Transferred Employees (or their covered spouses, dependents and
beneficiaries) that are incurred but not paid prior to such Transferred
Employees Transition Date. For purposes of this Section 5.5(d), a claim or
Liability is deemed to be incurred (i) with respect to medical, dental,
vision and/or prescription drug benefits, upon the rendering of health
services giving rise to such claim or Liability, (ii) with respect to life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance, upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to such
claim or Liability and (iii) with respect to disability benefits, upon the
date of an individuals disability, as determined by the disability benefit
insurance carrier or claim administrator, giving rise to such claim or
Liability. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish
flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses for U.S.
Transferred Employees, and shall, as of the applicable Transition Date for
each U.S. Transferred Employee, credit such accounts with the amount (positive
or negative) credited as of the Transition Date for such Transferred Employee
under comparable accounts maintained under Business Benefit Plans of Seller.
Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the applicable Transition Date of
each Transferred Employee, (i) Seller shall pay to Purchaser in cash the
amount, if any, by which aggregate contributions made by such
U.S. Transferred Employee to Sellers flexible spending accounts exceeded the
aggregate benefits provided to such U.S. Transferred Employee as of such
applicable Transition Date, or (ii) Purchaser shall pay to Seller in cash the
amount, if any, by which aggregate benefits provided to such U.S. Transferred
Employee under the Sellers flexible spending accounts exceeded the aggregate
contributions made by such U.S. Transferred Employee as of such applicable
Transition Date.

 

(e) _Severance_.

 

(i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.5, Purchaser shall have in effect for twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date severance plans, practices and policies applicable to each
Transferred Employee that are not less favorable in the aggregate (other than
with respect to severance pay, which shall be at least equal to that in
effect prior to Closing) than such plans, practices and policies applicable to
such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates, for all Deal Related Severance up to a maximum
amount in the

 



102  aggregate equal to the Severance Cap. Thereafter, Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for fifty
percent (50%) of the Deal Related Severance in excess of the Severance Cap.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the costs of all Termination Amounts
for Transferred Employees to the extent such amounts do not constitute Deal
Related Severance and are triggered as a result of actions taken by Purchaser
after the applicable Transition Date (or, in the case of any OUS Conveyed
Company SSE, the date that is fifteen (15) days after the applicable SSE
Reference Date for such OUS Conveyed Company SSE) of such Transferred
Employee (and such amounts shall not count towards the Severance Cap, other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, Continued Vesting, which decreases the
Severance Cap as set forth in the definition thereof). Seller shall be solely
responsible, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates, for all Termination Amounts payable to Shared Service Employees to
the extent not expressly Purchasers responsibility pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it being understood and agreed that Purchaser
shall only be responsible for Termination Amounts for OUS Conveyed Company
SSEs that remain employed with Purchaser fifteen (15) days after their
applicable SSE Reference Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall be solely responsible and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for (x) Deal Related Severance and (y)
the Intrinsic Value (determined as of the date of determination) of the
portion of any equity or equity-based awards held by any Business Employee
that automatically vest under a Benefit Plan by reason of the termination of
his or her employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates (including
termination of a Business Employees employment by Seller or any of its
Affiliates following rejection by such Business Employee of an offer of
employment from the Purchaser) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Restructuring, in each of the
foregoing cases, to the extent resulting from Purchasers failure to comply
with the provisions of Section 5.5 and such amounts shall not count towards
the Severance Cap; _provided_ , _that_ , Purchasers obligation under the
immediately preceding clause (y) shall be payable in cash to such Business
Employee (or, at the option of Purchaser, to Seller in lieu thereof, in which
case Seller shall automatically assume any and all obligations to such
Business Employee with respect to such vesting) in full satisfaction of
Purchasers obligations under such clause (and in no event shall such clause
(y) require Purchaser to issue any equity or equity-based awards). In the
event that it is determined that Purchaser or its Affiliates have paid for
Deal Related Severance or Termination Amounts in excess of the amount for
which Purchaser is responsible under this Section 5.5(e)(ii), Seller shall,
promptly after such determination, reimburse and pay over, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, for the amount of
such excess.

 

(iii) Seller shall encourage each Business Employee and each Non-OUS Conveyed
Company SSE who is offered employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to accept such
offers and not make any commitment to any Business Employee or Non-OUS
Conveyed Company SSE who is offered employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement about
continuing the employment of such Person with Seller or its Affiliates
following the Closing (or, in the case of a Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE, the
applicable SSE Reference Date for such Non-OUS

 



103  Conveyed Company SSE) or otherwise knowingly discourage such Person from
accepting such offers; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing herein shall be
interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide any
Business Employee or Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE with any additional
compensation or benefits to incent such Person to accept such offer of
employment. Further, subject to applicable Law or employment Contract
terms existing prior to the date hereof, and except as required to provide
any necessary notice of termination, Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (x) employ or continue to employ or subsequently employ, in each
case on or before the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date, any
Business Employee who rejects any such offer and does not receive any Deal
Related Severance or Termination Amounts in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Restructuring or (y) employ or continue
to employ or subsequently employ, in each case on or before the date that is
nine (9) months after the Closing Date, any Business Employee who receives
Deal Related Severance or Termination Amounts in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Restructuring. To the
extent permissible under applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not constitute a separation,
termination or severance of employment of any Transferred Employee (or any
Business Employee) prior to or upon the occurrence of the applicable
Transition Date therefor, including for purposes of any Benefit Plan that
provides for separation, termination or severance benefits, and that such
employee will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before
and immediately after the Transition Date, and Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with any requirements
under applicable Law to ensure the same, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing provisions, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate, communicate and assist each
other in eliminating or reducing any Business Employees right to receive any
Deal Related Severance in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Restructuring; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing herein
shall be interpreted as requiring any Party or any of its Affiliates to
provide any Business Employee with any additional compensation or benefits to
eliminate or reduce any Business Employees right to receive any Deal Related
Severance in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Restructuring. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, prior
to the Closing, Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to provide
Seller a list of any Business Employees (if any) that Purchaser would prefer
remain employees of Seller following the Closing (and, thus, not offered
employment (or otherwise hired) by Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and Seller may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, elect that any such Business Employees (or one
or more of them) cease to be deemed "Business Employees" for all purposes of
this Agreement, in which case all obligations of Purchaser or its Affiliates
with respect thereto shall cease (including any obligation respecting Deal
Related Severance) and Seller may, at its sole option, continue to employ such
employees.

 



104 (f) _Equity Compensation_.

 

(i) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.5(f)(i), within thirty (30)
days following the applicable Transition Date for each Transferred Employee,
Purchaser will provide, or cause Holdings to provide, such Transferred
Employee with equity-based compensation grants which are of equivalent value
(determined by Intrinsic Value (including negative Intrinsic Value of
underwater stock options) on the Transition Date) and have the same vesting
terms (other than with respect to any performance vesting terms, which shall
be deemed to not be in place) as the unvested equity-based
compensation grants (the " _Unvested Grants_ ") held by such Transferred
Employee on the Transition Date and giving effect to any pro rata vesting that
occurs in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
their employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Conveyed Companies) (such new grants, collectively, the
" _Converted Equity Awards_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , if a Transferred
Employee is terminated by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates for any
reason other than for "cause" during the one (1) year period following the
Closing Date, then any condition to vesting based on continued employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (effective as of immediately prior to such
termination) be eliminated such that any then-unvested portion of any
Converted Equity Awards (such then-unvested equity, the " _Continuing Vesting
Equity_ ") held by such Transferred Employee will continue to vest pursuant
to, and otherwise be subject to, the terms set forth in such Converted Equity
Award notwithstanding that such Transferred Employee is no longer employed
with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (the " _Continued Vesting_ ").
Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.5(f)(i), each Converted Equity
Award shall have the same Intrinsic Value as of the date of grant that such
Unvested Grant had on the Transition Date. Except as expressly set forth in
this Section 5.5(f), neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any obligation or Liability with respect to any equity compensation grants or
equity awards issued to, or held by, any Transferred Employee, Business
Employee or Shared Service Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) in no
event will the Purchaser be required to issue any incentive stock options
(i.e., options qualified under Section 422 of Code) in replacement of an
Unvested Grant (even if such Unvested Grant so qualifies or is intended to so
qualify) and (2) Unvested Grants shall include underwater stock options, which
shall also be included as Converted Equity Awards. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in no event will the Purchaser be required to issue
Converted Equity Awards with an aggregate Intrinsic Value (disregarding in
such calculation any negative Intrinsic Value) as of the date of grant greater
than $31,000,000.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.5(f)(i), Purchaser,
in its sole discretion, may unilaterally elect, in lieu of the issuance of a
Converted Equity Award, that any Unvested Grant held by a Transferred Employee
employed in the countries listed in _Schedule 5.5(f)(ii)_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Letter be cancelled in exchange for the payment of cash
consideration to such Transferred Employee equal to the Intrinsic Value of
such Converted Equity Award that would have otherwise been granted with
respect thereto, as of the date it would have been granted, less applicable
Tax withholding.

 



105 (iii) Prior to the Closing, and subject to the review and approval of
Purchaser, Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by this Section 5.5(f) under the applicable award
agreements and Sellers equity compensation plan(s), including adopting all
resolutions and giving all requisite notices to each Transferred Employee
holding Unvested Grants. Any materials to be submitted by Seller to the
Transferred Employees holding Unvested Grants in connection with this Section
5.5(f) shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Purchaser (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(iv) Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to effect the
termination of participation of any Transferred Employee in Sellers Employee
Stock Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time.

 

(g) _Liabilities_. Subject in all respects to Section 5.5(d) with respect to
incurred but unpaid claims and subject in all respects to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, as of the applicable Transition Date for each
Transferred Employee, (i) such Transferred Employee shall cease active
participation in, and to the extent applicable, shall cease accruing benefits
under, each Business Benefit Plan other than, to the extent applicable, the
Assumed Plans or Conveyed Company Benefits Plans and (ii) immediately prior to
the applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee, Seller shall
cease all responsibility for and Liability with respect to coverage for such
Transferred Employee under the Business Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 5.5 (including Section 5.5(d), Section
5.5(e), Section 5.5(f), Section 5.5(h), Section 5.5(j), Section 5.5(k),
Section 5.5(l), Section 5.5(m), Section 5.5(n), Section 5.5(o) and Section
5.5(p) and subject in all respects to Section 8.2 (which shall control in the
event of a conflict), from and after the applicable Transition Date for each
Transferred Employee, (1) Purchaser shall assume, honor and be solely
responsible for paying, providing and satisfying when such amounts
normally would be due under Sellers Benefit Plans (or at such earlier time
as agreed between Seller and Purchaser), without imposing any additional
conditions in respect thereof, the following: (A) all vacation, personal days,
sick pay and other paid time off for Transferred Employees earned but unused
as of the applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee, on terms
and conditions not less favorable than the terms and conditions in effect
immediately prior to the applicable Transition Date and (B) all compensation
(including salary, wages, overtime, premium pay and shift differentials),
vacation, personal days, sick pay and other paid time off (but excluding any
commissions, bonuses and incentive compensation) for Transferred Employees,
in each case, accruing, incurred or arising as a result of (x) employment with
Seller, Purchaser and their Affiliates or (y) separation from employment with
Purchaser after the applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee
and (2) Purchaser shall assume, honor and be solely responsible for paying,
providing and satisfying when such amounts normally would be due under
Sellers Benefit Plans (or at such earlier time as agreed between Seller and
Purchaser), without imposing any additional conditions in respect thereof, the
following: (A) to the extent accrued in Final Closing Working Capital
(including all Taxes imposed on the employer (including social or national
insurance contributions or similar obligations payable in connection
therewith) as a result of any of the foregoing) all commissions, bonuses and
incentive compensation for Transferred Employees accruing, incurred or arising
as a result of employment with Seller and their Affiliates (the " _Bonus
Amounts_ ") and (B) all commissions, bonuses and incentive compensation for
Transferred Employees accruing, incurred or arising as a result of
employment 

 



106  with Purchaser and its Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Final Closing Working Capital shall include a current liability for the
Bonus Amounts, which current liability shall (x) be determined in good faith
and consistent with Sellers accounting practices and bonus calculation
practices for partial performance periods, (y) include employer-sided
employment Taxes (including social or national insurance contributions or
similar obligations payable in connection therewith) and (z) be determined
disregarding any condition to payment or similar requirement that Transferred
Employees be employees of Seller or one of its Affiliates on the date
the Bonus Amounts are paid. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Seller shall determine the Bonus Amounts and provide reasonable
documentation to Purchaser regarding such determination.

 

(h) _COBRA_. Except pursuant to (and for the periods covered by) the
Transition Services Agreement with respect to Transferred
Employees, effective as of the applicable Transition Date for each
Transferred Employee, Purchaser shall be responsible for providing COBRA
continuation coverage to such Transferred Employee (and his or her spouse and
dependents).

 

(i) _Credited Service_. With respect to each Benefit Plan that is contributed
to, sponsored, maintained or entered into by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates for which Transferred Employees may be eligible and in which they
participate, Purchaser shall, except as would result in the duplication of
benefits, use reasonable best efforts to recognize and cause its Affiliates
to recognize, for all Transferred Employees from and after the applicable
Transition Date for such Transferred Employee, credit for all service with
Seller and its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors) prior to the
applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (but specifically excluding defined
benefit pension benefits, non-qualified retirement benefits and deferred
compensation arrangements).

 

(j) _U.S. Pension Plan_. The Transferred Employees (and their respective
alternate payees) who are active participants (" _U.S. Pension Participants_
") in the Tyco Electronics Pension Plan (" _Seller s U.S. Pension Plan_")
shall cease to be an active participant or actively accrue benefits under
Sellers U.S. Pension Plan as of the applicable Transition Date for such
Transferred Employee. Such U.S. Pension Participants shall be treated as term
vested participants in Sellers U.S. Pension Plan and shall receive benefits
from Sellers U.S. Pension Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan.
Seller shall take all actions necessary to fully vest the U.S. Pension
Participants in their benefits under Sellers U.S. Pension Plan as of the
applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee. Neither Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Conveyed
Companies) shall have any obligation with respect to Sellers U.S. Pension
Plan and all Liabilities and obligations thereunder (whether arising before or
after the date hereof and whether or not relating to Transferred Employees,
Business Employees, Former Employees, Shared Service Employees or otherwise)
(the " _Retained U.S. Pension Plan Liability_ ") shall be Retained Liabilities
for all purposes of this Agreement.

(k) _Non-U.S. Retirement Plans._ The Transferred Employees (assuming for
purposes of this Section 5.5(k) that all Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs
are Transferred Employees) who are active participants (the " _Non-U.S.
Pension Participants_ ") in Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans shall cease to
be an active participant or actively accrue 

 



107  benefits under Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans as of the Closing (or
Delayed Transfer Closing, as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary herein, other than with respect to any Liabilities
under the Germany Pension Plans for the Transferred Employees which are
required by applicable Law to be assumed by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in no event
shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates have any obligation with respect to
the Germany Pension Plans and all Liabilities and obligations thereunder
(whether arising before or after the Closing Date) shall be Retained
Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement (the " _Retained German
Pension Plan Liability_ ").

(l) _Savings Plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans_. Each
Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Tyco Electronics Corporation
Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (the " _Seller Savings Plan_ ") shall
cease to be an active participant or actively accrue benefits in such plan
effective as of the applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee.
Seller shall take all actions necessary to fully vest each Transferred
Employee in his or her benefits under the Seller Savings Plan as of the
applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee and shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that all employer contributions to such Seller
Savings Plan shall be contributed to the Seller Savings Plan as of the
applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee for all time periods
through such applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee.
Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to have, in effect a defined contribution plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the " _Purchaser Savings Plan_ ") in which Transferred Employees
who meet the eligibility criteria thereof shall be eligible to participate
following their respective Transition Date. Purchaser agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept rollovers by
Transferred Employees from the Seller Savings Plan, including promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans. Each Transferred Employee who is a
participant in the Tyco Electronics Corporation Supplemental Savings
and Retirement Plan (the " _Seller SSRP_ ") shall cease to be active
participants or actively accrue benefits in such plan effective as of the
applicable Transition Date for such Transferred Employee. Seller shall take
all actions necessary to fully vest each Transferred Employee in his or her
benefits under the Seller SSRP as of the applicable Transition Date for such
Transferred Employee and the accounts of the Transferred Employees under the
Seller SSRP shall otherwise be treated in accordance with the Seller SSRP
terms. Effective as of the applicable Transition Date for each Transferred
Employee, Seller shall take all actions necessary to transfer the (i) accrued
benefit obligations for such Transferred Employee, as well as a proportionate
share of assets, if any, whether in a trust or otherwise, related to such
obligations and (ii) elections, including beneficiary and distribution
elections associated with such Transferred Employee under the Seller SSRP to
a nonqualified deferred compensation plan of Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller
agree that for purposes of Code Section 409A, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall not constitute a "separation from service", nor give
rise to a specific distribution event under Code Section 409A or the Seller
SSRP for the Transferred Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the
liabilities and assets (if any) related to the Seller SSRP shall not be taken
into account for purposes of Section 2.9(b).

(m) _Commingled Retirement Plans_. Except as otherwise may be agreed by
Purchaser and Seller, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
Purchaser to, use its

 



108  commercially reasonable efforts to establish or maintain as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing with
respect to a Delayed Transfer Country) one or more retirement plans (such
plan or plans, a " _Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan_ ") in each country in
which a Transferred Employee (assuming for purposes of this Section 5.5(m)
that all Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs are Transferred Employees) (but
specifically excluding Offerees and Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs) who
participated in a Commingled Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to a Delayed Transfer Country)
will be eligible to participate, with terms substantially comparable to the
terms of the applicable Commingled Retirement Plan as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to a
Delayed Transfer Country). To the extent permitted by Law, Seller or its
Affiliates shall cause the Commingled Retirement Plans in each country to
transfer (and Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan in
each country to accept a transfer of) benefit liabilities (determined as of
the Closing Date or Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to a Delayed
Transfer Country), regardless of whether such benefits are vested or unvested,
relating to the Non-U.S. Pension Participants (excluding Offerees and Non-OUS
Conveyed Company SSEs) under the Commingled Retirement Plans to the extent
applicable (the " _Assumed Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities_ ") and, to the extent
required by Law or collective bargaining (or similar) agreement or as may
become necessary in connection with the labor consultation process related to
the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall cause the Commingled
Retirement Plans in each jurisdiction to transfer (and Purchaser shall cause
the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plans in each country to accept a transfer
of) assets, but only in an amount equal to the minimum amount of assets
required by applicable Law or collective bargaining (or similar) agreement to
be transferred, from a Commingled Retirement Plan to the relevant Purchaser
Non-U.S. Retirement Plan in connection with the assumption of the Assumed
Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
such higher level of assets as may be reasonably determined advisable by the
Purchaser and subject to the Sellers consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), but not to exceed the amount of Assumed
Non-U.S. Pension Liabilities with respect to any given Purchaser Non-U.S.
Retirement Plan determined as of the Closing Date. Except as required by Law
or collective bargaining (or similar) agreement or as may become necessary in
connection with the labor consultation process related to the
transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates and the Commingled Retirement Plans (or the administrators thereof)
not to) make any contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding
through insurance or otherwise or commit to make any contribution of assets
or purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise to or in
respect of any Commingled Retirement Plan that would increase the amount of
assets required to be transferred to a Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan as
described above. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except as set forth in the
last sentence of this Section 5.5(m), Seller shall be responsible for any
Taxes required to be paid in connection with any such contribution of assets
or purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise, or
commitment to do the foregoing and (ii) nothing in this Section 5.5(m) shall
result in Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies
following Closing) assuming or accepting any "Section 75" debt arising from
any of Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans or other Non-U.S. Pension Plan that
is a United Kingdom Non-U.S. Pension Plan. The Parties agree to use reasonable
best efforts to accomplish each transfer described in this Section 5.5(m) as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing
with respect to a Delayed Transfer Country) and to 

 



109  cooperate in good faith to make such filings and disclosures and obtain such
approvals as may be deemed necessary or advisable in accordance with
applicable Law. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide that all
assets transferred in accordance with this Section 5.5(m) shall be transferred
in the form of cash, insurance contracts or marketable securities, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Taxes required to be paid in connection
with any contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding through
insurance or otherwise, or commitment to do the foregoing, to or in respect of
any Commingled Retirement Plan or Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding any such
Taxes required to be paid with respect to contribution of assets or purchase
of additional funding through insurance or otherwise relating to obligations
to Persons that are not Business Employees or Applicable OUS Conveyed Company
SSEs, which shall be borne 100% by Seller), shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Seller (except with respect to Taxes
that are actually recovered by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under
applicable Law, which shall be borne 100% by Purchaser to the extent actually
recovered).

(n)  _Dedicated Retirement Plans_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
effective as of the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to
a Delayed Transfer Country), an Affiliate of Purchaser shall assume or retain
sponsorship of, and shall retain or assume all assets (if any) and
Liabilities relating to, the Dedicated Retirement Plans. From and after the
date hereof, except as required by Law or collective bargaining (or similar)
agreement or as may become necessary in connection with the labor
consultation process related to the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates and the Dedicated Retirement Plans
(or the administrators thereof) not to) make any contribution of assets or
purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise or commit to
make any contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding through
insurance or otherwise to or in respect of any Dedicated Retirement Plans,
and, in such event that such actions are so required, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and the Dedicated Retirement Plans (or the administrators
thereof) to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the pension assets of
such Dedicated Retirement Plans as of the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer
Closing with respect to a Delayed Transfer Country) not to exceed the Pension
Liabilities in respect of each such Dedicated Retirement Plan as of the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except as set forth in the last
sentence of this Section 5.5(n), Seller shall be responsible for any Taxes
required to be paid in connection with any such contribution of assets or
purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise, or commitment
to do the foregoing and (ii) nothing in this Section 5.5(n) shall result in
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies following
Closing) assuming or accepting any "Section 75" debt arising from any of
Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans or other Non-U.S. Pension Plan that is a
United Kingdom Non-U.S. Pension Plan. Taxes required to be paid in connection
with any contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding through
insurance or otherwise, or commitment to do the foregoing, to or in respect of
any Dedicated Retirement Plans required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding any such Taxes required to be paid with respect
to contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding through insurance
or otherwise relating to obligations to Persons that are not Business
Employees, which shall be borne 100% by Seller), shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Seller (except with respect to
Taxes that are actually recovered by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under
applicable Law, which shall be borne 100% by Purchaser to the extent actually
recovered).

 



110 (o) _No Other Pension Obligations_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) except as specifically provided in Section
5.5(m), Section 5.5(n) or Section 5.5(p)(vi), neither the Purchaser nor its
Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies following Closing) shall have any
Liability (for the avoidance of doubt including (x) current or future
obligations to provide compensation or benefits and (y) any "Section 75" debt
arising from any of Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans or other Non-U.S.
Pension Plan that is a United Kingdom Non-U.S. Pension Plan) arising under,
in connection with, or with respect to any of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan,
Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Commingled Retirement Plan), any other Non-U.S. Pension Plan or any other
Benefit Plan that is a pension or retirement plan (whether with respect to any
Transferred Employee, Business Employee, Shared Service Employee or otherwise)
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Companies) and such Liabilities shall, as between
Purchaser and Seller, be the responsibility of Seller and shall be deemed a
Retained Employee Liability pursuant to this Agreement) and (ii) neither the
Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans (other than a Dedicated Retirement Plan)
nor any other Non-U.S. Pension Plan or any other Benefit Plan that is a
pension or retirement plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates shall be an
Assumed Plan or Conveyed Company Benefit Plan. Without limiting the foregoing,
in the event Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies
following the Closing) are required to honor, pay or provide any of the
Retained Employee Liabilities or payments, compensation or benefits not
assumed by it pursuant to this Agreement (including any payments or benefits
under or with respect to the Retained U.S. Pension Plan Liability or Retained
German Pension Plan Liability), Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser or such Affiliate thereof for any such items so honored, paid or
provided. In the event Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Conveyed
Companies following the Closing) are required to honor, pay or provide any
payments, compensation or benefits otherwise agreed pursuant to this Agreement
to be paid or provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed
Companies following the Closing), Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller or such Affiliate of Seller for any such items so honored,
paid or provided.

(p) _Shared Service Employees_.

 

(i) As of the Closing (or, with respect to any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company
SSEs employed by a Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company, the Delayed Transfer
Closing for such Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company), each Applicable OUS
Conveyed Company SSE shall be seconded to Seller and its Affiliates (or, to
the extent such secondment is not permitted by Law, some other
similar arrangement shall be reasonably agreed upon between Seller and
Purchaser) until the applicable SSE Reference Date for such Applicable OUS
Conveyed Company SSE (such period, with respect to any given Applicable OUS
Conveyed Company SSE, the " _Secondment Period_ ") and, subject to Section
5.5(p)(ii), Seller and its Affiliates shall be economically responsible, pay
and indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for all Liabilities with respect to
such Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE (and any spouse, dependent or
beneficiary thereof) that arise out of events or circumstances that occur, or
which are incurred, or which otherwise relate to, are triggered by or are
calculated by reference to periods occurring, on or prior to the applicable
SSE Reference Date to the same extent as if such Applicable OUS Conveyed
Company SSE otherwise remained an employee of Seller or one of its Affiliates.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent any of the 

 



111  Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs are terminated by Purchaser and its
Affiliates prior to the SSE Reference Date or within fifteen (15) days after
the SSE Reference Date, Seller shall be responsible for and promptly (A)
reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for any Termination Amount paid by it
with respect thereto and (B) pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Intrinsic
Value for the equity compensation awards granted pursuant to Section
5.5(f)(i) (the value of such awards shall be determined as of the date such
equity awards were granted) or the cash paid in lieu thereof pursuant to
Section 5.5(f)(ii). Notwithstanding that Seller shall be
economically responsible, pay and indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for
all Liabilities with respect to Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs as
described above, (a) the employment of each Applicable OUS Conveyed Company
SSE shall not terminate upon the Closing (or, with respect to any Applicable
OUS Conveyed Company SSEs employed by a Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company, the
Delayed Transfer Closing for such Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company) but shall
continue immediately thereafter with the applicable Conveyed Company as
described with respect to Business Employees in the first sentence of Section
5.5(a) (as clarified in Section 5.5(c)) and (b) Sections 5.5(c), 5.5(d),
5.5(f) and 5.5(i) shall apply to each Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE as
if he or she were a Transferred Employee whose Transition Date was the Closing
Date (or, with respect to any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE employed by
a Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company, the Delayed Transfer Closing Date for
such Delayed Transfer Conveyed Company). Purchaser and its Affiliates will not
terminate the employment of any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE with an
effective date prior to the SSE Reference Date without the prior written
consent of Seller (and in the event such termination is to occur on the SSE
Reference Date or within fifteen (15) days thereafter, notice of such
termination shall not be delivered more than fifteen (15) days (or such
longer period as is required by applicable Law) prior to such termination),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Upon
Sellers reasonable request prior to the SSE Reference Date, Purchaser agrees
to terminate any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE, provided Seller and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for any Termination Amount with respect to
such Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE. With respect to any Replacement
Shared Service Employee Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hire
such Replacement Shared Service Employee such that he or she is a Non-OUS
Conveyed Company SSE (rather than an OUS Conveyed Company SSE).

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.5(p)(i), (a) if
Seller or one of its Affiliates pays to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on
a monthly basis the Applicable Payment Amount for such Applicable OUS Conveyed
Company SSE promptly following delivery by Purchaser of reasonable detail with
respect to the calculation of such Applicable Payment Amount, then neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be economically responsible, pay or
indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for any Liabilities of such OUS
Conveyed Company SSE that arise out of events or circumstances that occur,
or which are incurred, or which otherwise relate to, are triggered by or are
calculated by reference to periods occurring during the Secondment Period of
such OUS Conveyed Company SSE for compensation (including salary, wages,
commissions, bonuses, incentive compensation, overtime, premium pay and shift
differentials), perquisites, vacation, personal days, sick pay or other paid
time off or benefits or benefits claims (including health and welfare,
retirement and pension 

 



112  benefits) (or any Taxes imposed on the employer as a result of any of the
foregoing), (b) to the extent accrued in Final Closing Working Capital,
Purchaser shall be responsible for, pay and discharge when due all amounts
for compensation (including salary, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive
compensation, overtime, premium pay and shift differentials), perquisites,
vacation, personal days, sick pay or other paid time off or benefits or
benefits claims (including health and welfare, retirement and pension
benefits) (or any Taxes imposed on the employer as a result of any of the
foregoing) of any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE that arise out of events
or circumstances that occur, or which are incurred, or which otherwise relate
to, are triggered by or are calculated by reference to periods occurring prior
to the Closing and (c) to the extent the Liabilities of an Applicable OUS
Conveyed Company SSE under any Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan or
Dedicated Retirement Plan were reflected in the calculation of the Final
Pension Deficit Amount, Purchaser shall be responsible for, pay and discharge
when due all amounts due to any Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSE under
such Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan or Dedicated Retirement Plan. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall also be responsible for all business expenses
incurred by Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs during the
Secondment Period.

(iii) To the extent permitted by Law, as soon as practicable after the
Closing, but in any event prior to the date that is one hundred and twenty
(120) days prior to the earliest SSE Reference Date, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a list identifying each of the Shared Service Employees by name and
providing, with respect to each, the information required to be set forth on
the Employee Census with respect to Business Employees provided pursuant to
Section 5.5(q). To the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall, from and after
the date that is one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the SSE Reference
Date, provide such other information reasonably requested by Purchaser with
respect to such Shared Service Employees, including permitting meetings and
interviews (either in person or via telephone) with Shared Service Employees
during normal business hours and on at least five Business Days notice to
Seller for purposes of assisting Purchaser to evaluate whether to retain
employment of or extend, or cause its Affiliates to retain employment of or
extend, offers of employment thereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to an
applicable SSE Reference Date (the " _SSE Trigger Date_ "), Purchaser shall
inform Seller in writing which (A) Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs, if any, will
receive offers of employment from Purchaser and its Affiliates, and Seller
and its Affiliates will, effective as of the applicable SSE Reference Date,
terminate the employment of any Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE who receives an
offer of employment from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and (B)
Applicable OUS Conveyed Company SSEs, if any, Purchaser intends to terminate.

(iv) Seller shall, from and after the SSE Trigger Date to the SSE Reference
Date, assist Purchaser and its Affiliates in making offers of employment, if
any, to Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs who Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
determines to make such an offer for employment. To the extent Purchaser, in
its sole discretion, determines to make such an offer for employment, such
offers (i) shall be made with respect to a date of commencement of employment
on the applicable SSE Reference Date for such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE
and (ii) must otherwise offer terms of employment for such Non-OUS Conveyed
Company SSE of the type described in the second sentence of Section 5.5(b) (as
clarified in Section 5.5(c)) with respect to Business Employees.

 



113 (v) Any Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE who accepts such offer of employment
with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall become a Transferred Employee
for purposes of this Agreement but only from and after the applicable
Transition Date of such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE. Any Applicable OUS
Conveyed Company SSE whose employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates has
not ceased on or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) days after the
applicable SSE Reference Date of such OUS Conveyed Company SSE shall become a
Transferred Employee for purposes of this Agreement but only from and after
the applicable Transition Date of such OUS Conveyed Company SSE.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
expressly provided in Section 5.5(p)(ii)(b), neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have or assume any Liabilities with respect to any Shared
Service Employee (or any spouse, dependent or beneficiary thereof) by virtue
of such Shared Service Employee being a Transferred Employee for any
Liabilities that arise out of events or circumstances that occur, or which
are incurred, or which otherwise relate to, are triggered by or are calculated
by reference to periods occurring, on or prior to the applicable Transition
Date of such Shared Service Employee for compensation (including salary,
wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive compensation, overtime, premium pay and
shift differentials), perquisites, vacation, personal days, sick pay or other
paid time off, Deal Related Severance or Termination Amounts triggered by
reason of the termination of employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Restructuring) or benefits or benefits claims (or any
Taxes imposed on the employer as a result of any of the foregoing), and all
such Liabilities shall be Retained Employee Liabilities for all purposes of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that it shall
assume up to four (4) weeks of accrued and unpaid vacation, personal days,
sick pay or other paid time off for each Shared Service Employee who becomes a
Transferred Employee (or, with respect to an OUS Conveyed Company SSE, such
greater amount as is accrued in Final Closing Working Capital as described in
Section 5.5(p)(ii)). Except as set forth in Section 5.5(p)(vi), neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have or assume any Liability or
obligation for a Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE (or any spouse, dependent or
beneficiary thereof) that becomes a Transferred Employee arising under, in
connection with, or with respect to any of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan,
Sellers Non-U.S. Retirement Plans (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any Commingled Retirement Plan), any other Non-U.S. Pension Plan or any other
Benefit Plan that is a pension or retirement plan maintained, contributed to
or sponsored by Seller or its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies)
and all such Liabilities or obligations shall be Retained Employee Liabilities
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(vi) Effective as of such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs or Offerees
Transition Date, each such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE or Offeree who
participated in a Commingled Retirement Plan immediately prior to such Non-OUS
Conveyed Company SSEs or Offerees Transition Date will be eligible to
participate in the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan established in the
country in which such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE or Offeree is employed to
the extent employed in such

 



114  country prior to his or her Transition Date. To the extent permitted by Law,
Seller or its Affiliates shall cause the Commingled Retirement Plans in each
country to transfer as of such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs or Offerees
Transition Date (and Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement
Plan in each country to accept a transfer of) accrued benefit liabilities
(determined as of each such Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs or Offerees
Transition Date) under the Commingled Retirement Plans, regardless of whether
benefits are vested or unvested, relating to the Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs
who become Transferred Employees and Offerees (the " _Assumed Shared Service
Pension Liabilities_ "), and, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall
cause the Commingled Retirement Plans in each jurisdiction to transfer (and
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plans in each country
to accept a transfer of) assets in an amount equal to the Assumed Shared
Service Pension Liability Amount (based on the fair market value of such
assets on the date of transfer). The Parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish each transfer as soon as practicable
following the Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSEs or Offerees Transition Date and
to cooperate in good faith to make such filings and disclosures and obtain
such approvals as may be deemed necessary or advisable in accordance with
applicable Law. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
that all assets transferred in accordance with this Section 5.5(p)(vi) shall
be transferred in the form of cash, insurance contracts or marketable
securities, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. No later than six (6)
months after the last Transition Date for any Non-OUS Conveyed Company SSE
that becomes a Transferred Employee, Seller shall pay (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Purchaser)
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate amount of Assumed
Shared Service Pension Liability Amount (together with 50% of amount of all
Taxes or other surcharges payable by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the assumption of the Assumed Shared Service Pension
Liabilities (including the amount of Taxes on any additional funding required
to be made by Purchaser to any Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan in
connection therewith) or acceptance of assets into the Purchaser Non-U.S.
Retirement Plans) over (ii) the fair market value of assets transferred from
the relevant Commingled Retirement Plan (determined as of the transfer date
of such assets) to the corresponding Purchaser Non-U.S. Retirement Plan. For
purposes of this Section 5.5(p)(vi), the "Assumed Shared Service Pension
Liability Amount" shall mean the aggregate amount of Assumed Shared Service
Pension Liabilities, determined (x) on a projected benefit obligation basis
with respect to defined benefit plans and (y) on an accrued benefit basis with
respect to any defined contribution plan, in each case regardless of whether
benefits are vested or unvested, and calculated, in each case, using the
methodology and assumptions set forth in Section 2.9(b) and _Schedule E_ to
the extent applicable, but calculated to determine the amount of such
Liabilities as of the applicable Transition Date.

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly provided in Section
5.5(p)(ii), in no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates have or
assume any Liabilities or obligations with respect to any Shared Service
Employee (or any spouse, dependent or beneficiary thereof) who does not become
a Transferred Employee and all such Liabilities and obligations shall be
Retained Employee Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



115 (q) _No Amendment; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Employee Census; Additional
Employee Matters; Provision of Agreements and Information_. The provisions of
this Section 5.5 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (a) constitute an
employment agreement or an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits
plans maintained for or provided to Transferred Employees prior to or
following the Closing, (b) confer upon or give to any Person, other than the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for
in this Section 5.5 under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement or
(c) prohibit Purchaser from terminating the employment of any Transferred
Employee following the Closing Date. From and after the date of this
Agreement, at Purchasers reasonable request, with respect to each Assumed
Plan and Conveyed Company Benefit Plan, Seller shall provide to Purchaser:
(A) true and complete copies of all plan documents (including amendments and
modifications thereof) and all summary plan descriptions and similar plan
summaries (including summaries of all material amendments), (B) the
most recent opinion or determination letter or similar document received from
any Governmental Authority, if applicable, and (C) all material notices of or
correspondence with any Governmental Authority as to any matter related to
such plans compliance with applicable Law that remains unresolved or with
respect to which any remaining material Liability to Purchaser (or its
Affiliates) could be incurred. Seller shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, within thirty (30) days of the date hereof, provide to
Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the Material Contracts
described in clause (z) of the last sentence of Section 3.11(a). As promptly
as practical after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall supplement the
Employee Census to include the Shared Service Employees (and the underlying
information with respect thereto) and, in addition, with respect to each
Business Employee and Shared Service Employee, the base salary or wage rate,
target bonus opportunity, and service credited for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate under any Benefit Plan, and any defined benefit,
pension or similar plans applicable to each individual and such other
information as reasonably requested by Purchaser from time to time prior to
the Closing to determine its obligations under Section 5.5, but in no event
shall such requests be made more frequently than monthly; _provided_ , _that_
, the information respecting Shared Service Employees need only be provided
prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after such Shared Service Employee
is individually identified. Seller shall update the Employee Census
periodically prior to the Closing Date to reflect changes in the Business and
financial structure of the Business, new hires, leaves of absence and
employment terminations and any other changes thereto and provide copies of
such updated lists and information to Purchaser, which updated Employee
Census shall be based on the Business and financial structure of the Business
as of the date of such updated Employee Census. The Parties also agree and
acknowledge that the Purchased Assets include, to the extent permitted by Law
and the terms of the applicable agreement, and Seller shall assign to
Purchaser, in each case, Sellers and its Affiliates rights to enforce all
employee non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, assignment of
inventions and similar restrictive covenant agreements with any Business
Employee and Shared Service Employee, and such rights (but not obligations)
under such agreements with any Former Employee, in each case, to the extent
such rights relate to the Business. All equity or equity based grants
required to be made by Purchaser under this Agreement may be made by Holdings
with equity or equity based grants of Holdings. Further, in the event that
Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser on the other hand, (as applicable, the
" _Paying Party_ ") is required to retain, honor, pay or provide any of the
items contemplated to be assumed,

 



116  honored, paid or provided by the other under this Section 5.5 (the "
_Responsible Party_ "), such Responsible Party shall indemnify and hold
harmless such Paying Party for any such items so retained, honored, paid or
provided by such Paying Party.

Section 5.6 Wage Reporting; I-9s; Work Permits; Required Notifications.
Purchaser and Seller shall utilize, or cause their Affiliates to utilize, the
standard procedure set forth in Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53 with respect
to United States wage reporting for the full calendar year in which
a Transition Date occurs with respect to wage reporting, pursuant to which
Purchaser and Seller shall each perform all wage reporting duties for the
wages that it pays to the Transferred Employees. Seller shall prepare and
furnish Forms W-2 for the Transferred Employees for wages paid by Seller and
Purchaser shall prepare and furnish Forms W-2 for the Transferred Employees
for wages paid by Purchaser. Seller shall retain all Transferred Employees
Forms W-4 and W-5. Purchaser shall obtain new Forms W-4 and W-5 from the
Transferred Employees. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide,
prior to, at or reasonably promptly after the applicable Transition Date for
each Transferred Employee, to Purchaser such Transferred Employees Form
I-9s. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take reasonably necessary or appropriate actions, which are
reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist in transferring to Purchaser,
or obtaining for Purchaser, any work permit or similar approval required for
any Transferred Employee or, to the extent proposed to be hired by Purchaser
or its Affiliates, any Shared Service Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law or collective bargaining (or
similar) agreement, in the event an applicable work permit for such employee
is not in place with Purchaser or its Affiliate as of the Transition Date, the
Parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide for the services of such
employee to be made available exclusively to Purchaser through an employee
secondment, services or similar arrangement under which Purchaser shall be
responsible for the economic costs of such individuals compensation and
benefits (including reimbursement for any expenses incurred by such employee,
all applicable fees and Taxes with respect thereto) for such service period on
commercially reasonable terms until the applicable work permit can
be obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable work permit.

 

Section 5.7 Assumption of Assumed Plans. Effective on and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, adopt the Assumed
Plans and assume all Liabilities and responsibilities of the applicable Seller
Entity thereunder, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Retained
Employee Liabilities and Liabilities for which Seller is
expressly responsible pursuant to Section 5.5 or Section 2.5.

Section 5.8 Non-US Employees. For any Transferred Employees who are
principally based outside of the United States, the provisions of Sections
5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 shall apply to such employees _mutatis mutandis_ to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.9 Bulk Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller
Entities have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action that may be
required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or
similar Laws. Purchaser shall not withhold any portion of the Aggregate
Purchase Price based on such non-compliance. The foregoing shall not
limit (a) any representations or warranties of Seller in this Agreement or
(b) except as provided in this Section 5.9, Purchasers right to withhold any
amount pursuant to Section 2.12 of this Agreement.

 



117 Section 5.10 Resale or Other Exemption Certificates. At the Closing (or within
such reasonable time thereafter as may be necessary to perfect the resale or
other exemption certificates), Purchaser shall deliver to Seller fully
completed and executed resale exemption certificates or other applicable
exemption certificates for all jurisdictions identified by the Seller as
jurisdictions in which Inventory is to be transferred. To the extent any
jurisdiction refuses to accept any resale exemption certificate or other
applicable exemption certificate provided by Purchaser, Seller and Purchaser
agree that any Transfer Taxes assessed by such jurisdiction shall be borne 50%
by Purchaser and 50% by Seller.

 

Section 5.11 Post-Closing Information.

 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, upon reasonable
prior written request delivered to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Conveyed Companies and the Subsidiaries of Purchaser with
respect to the Business to, afford to Seller and its Representatives
reasonable access during regular normal business hours to the properties,
books and records and employees of Purchaser, the Conveyed Companies and the
Subsidiaries of Purchaser with respect to the Business to the extent necessary
to prepare or defend any judicial or administrative proceeding related to the
Business, or to enable Seller and its Representatives to satisfy Sellers and
its Affiliates financial reporting obligations and, subject to Section 7.8,
Tax Return preparation and filing obligations, or, subject to Section 7.5, to
assist Seller and its Affiliates in connection with any Contest.

(b) For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, Seller and its
Representatives (including its outside accountants) shall have reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice,
to the records of the Business and to personnel of Purchaser, the Conveyed
Companies and the Subsidiaries of Purchaser and to any other information or
personnel thereof that Seller reasonably requests in connection with Seller
completing the audit of its accounts; _provided_ _that_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, in the case of Tax Records, Seller and its Representatives (including
its outside accountants) shall have reasonable access pursuant to this Section
5.11(b) for as long as such Tax Records are required to be maintained by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.9.

 

(c) For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, upon prior written
request delivered to Seller, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
afford to Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access during regular
normal business hours to their books and records relating to the Business,
including Tax records, personnel records, records relating to the
Business Benefit Plans and financial records and related work papers solely
to the extent necessary for the Purchasers operation of the Business or

related to the Business or to enable Purchaser and its Representatives to
satisfy Purchasers and its Affiliates financial reporting obligations and,
subject to Section 7.8, Tax Return preparation and filing obligations, or,
subject to Section 7.5, to assist Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection
with any Contest.

 



118 Any such access by Purchaser or Seller under this Section 5.11 shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the other or its
Affiliates. The Person receiving such access shall bear the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Person
in providing such access under this Section 5.11. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required
to disclose, or require its Affiliates to disclose, any information to the
other or its Representatives under this Section 5.11 if such disclosure would
(a) jeopardize any attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege or
(b) contravene any applicable Order or Law (including privacy Laws), fiduciary
duty or binding agreement (including any confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement); _provided_ , _that_ , in any of the foregoing events, the
disclosing Person shall inform the other as to the general nature of what is
being withheld as a result of the foregoing and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege or contravene any applicable Order, Law, fiduciary duty or
agreement. Further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) Purchaser may redact
any information covered by this Section 5.11 as and to the extent such
information relates to Purchasers business, assets or liabilities other than
the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and
(ii) Seller may redact any information covered by this Section 5.11 as and to
the extent such information relates to Sellers business, assets or
liabilities other than the Business, the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in the event of any Action or threatened Action between the Parties or
their respective Affiliates (including any such Action relating to this
Agreement or any related agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby), the covenants contained herein shall not apply with respect to
access or any information related thereto (or the subject matter thereof) or
requested in connection therewith and the requesting Party must utilize the
available rules of discovery under applicable Law (provided that such
restriction shall not apply to any information to the extent necessary for
such Party to prepare any Tax Returns), nor shall the covenants herein be
considered a waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product or any
similar privilege.

Section 5.12 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. For a period of six
(6) years after the Closing, the Constituent Documents of each of the Conveyed
Companies shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification of Conveyed Company Covered Persons in their respective
capacities as such than are set forth in such documents immediately prior to
the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years after the Closing in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or prior to
the Closing were present or former individual managers, members, directors,
officers, employees or, to the extent covered by Sellers directors and
officers liability insurance, agents of the Conveyed Companies and, in each
of the foregoing cases, who is a natural person (each, together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators, a " _Conveyed Company Covered
Person_ ") relating to service in such capacities prior to the Closing. At or
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall obtain directors and officers
liability, employment practices liability and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage for all Conveyed Entity Covered Persons that covers on a primary
basis acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing (including, with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) with a coverage
limit of $20 million and other terms (including coverage period, retention or
deductible amounts) as are reasonably acceptable to Seller. One-half of the
cost of any premiums for such policy

 



119  shall be treated as a transaction expense payable by the Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, any such prepaid insurance shall not be included as a
current asset for purposes of calculating the Final Closing Working Capital.
The rights of each Conveyed Company Covered Person hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Conveyed Company
Covered Person may have under the Constituent Documents of each of the
Conveyed Companies, any other indemnification arrangement (unless such
indemnification arrangement materially increases such Persons rights to
indemnification beyond such Persons rights pursuant to such Constituent
Documents and is not set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter), applicable Laws or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.12
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and are
expressly intended to benefit each Conveyed Company Covered Person. This
Section 5.12 shall in no event limit Purchasers or the other Purchaser
Indemnitees rights, or Sellers obligations, under Section 7.6 or Article
VIII, and indemnification amounts paid or advanced by Purchaser or its
Affiliates to Conveyed Company Covered Persons may be Losses for purposes
thereof.

 

Section 5.13 Replacement of Parent Guarantees.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall use their reasonable best
efforts to, effective on or before the Closing, (i) cause to be terminated
each of the parent guarantees listed on _Schedule 5.13(a)(i)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or any guarantees entered into after the date set forth on
_Schedule 5.13(a)(i)_ in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with
past practice (including renewals and extensions of any of the foregoing) (the
" _Parent Guarantees_ "), (ii) replace the surety and other bonds set forth on
_Schedule 5.13(a)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or any surety and
other bonds issued after the date set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)(ii)_ in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with respect to the
Business (including renewals and extensions of any of the foregoing) (the "
_Seller Surety Bonds_ "), (iii) replace the letters of credit set forth on
_Schedule 5.13(a)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or any letters of
credit issued after the date set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)(iii)_ in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice by Seller or any of
its Affiliates with respect to the Business (other than the Conveyed
Companies) in support of any obligation of the Business (the " _Parent LofCs_
") and (iv) terminate any reimbursement obligations or other Contracts for
obligations or Liabilities of the Business between and among Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Companies), on the one hand, and
the beneficiary of any such Parent Guarantee or the provider of any such
Parent LofC, on the other hand, in each case, to the extent such Parent
Guarantees, Seller Surety Bonds, Parent LofCs or Contracts relate to the
Business. In the event that any such Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC
remains outstanding as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller
at the Closing an unconditional letter of credit in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Seller from a bank or other financial institution
reasonably acceptable to Seller for (A) in the case of any such Seller Surety
Bond set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)(ii)_ , the aggregate amount set forth on
_Schedule 5.13(a)(ii)_ with respect to such Seller Surety Bond (but in no
event more than the face amount thereof), (B) in the case of any such Seller
Surety Bond entered into after the date set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)(ii)_
in accordance with this Section 5.13(a), the aggregate face amount of such
Seller Surety Bond, (C) in the case any such Parent LofC set forth on
_Schedule 5.13(a)(iii)_, the aggregate amount set forth on _Schedule
5.13(a)(iii)_ with respect to such Parent LofC (but in no event more than the
face amount thereof), and (D) in the case of any such Parent LofC entered into
after the date set forth on _Schedule 5.13(a)(iii)_ in accordance with this
Section 5.13(a), the aggregate face amount 

 



120  of such Parent LofC, in each case, to the extent such Seller Surety Bonds or
Parent LofCs relate to the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates delivers an unconditional
letter of credit directly to the third party beneficiary of any Seller Surety
Bond or Parent LofC respecting the obligation to which such Seller Surety Bond
or Parent LofC relates, and the third party beneficiary accepts such
unconditional letter of credit, then Purchasers obligations to issue any
unconditional letter of credit to Seller with respect to such Seller Surety
Bond or Parent LofC shall be deemed satisfied to the extent of the amount
so issued by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and accepted by the third
party and, if Purchaser has already issued such an unconditional letter of
credit to Seller with respect to such Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC,
Purchaser may terminate or withdraw such unconditional letter of credit made
to Seller without Liability or obligation other than Purchasers obligations
under Section 5.13(b) (up to the amount of the unconditional letter of credit
issued to, and accepted by, the third party beneficiary).

(b) To the extent Purchaser and Seller are unable to terminate or replace a
Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC that relates to the
Business or obtain the beneficiarys consent to the substitution thereof prior
to the Closing as contemplated by Section 5.13(a), Purchaser shall have a
continuing obligation after the Closing to use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such Parent Guarantee or Seller Surety Bond terminated or replaced in
a manner consistent with Section 5.13(a) and to have any such Parent LofC
terminated, and Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser in
connection therewith. To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates has
payment or performance obligations under (i) any such Parent Guarantee or (ii)
any Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC with respect to which Purchasers
obligations to issue any unconditional letter of credit to Seller shall be
deemed reduced or satisfied in accordance with the last sentence of Section
5.13(a), in each case, related to the Business, Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to pay
and perform such obligations on behalf of Seller or such Affiliate of Seller
or otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put
Seller or such Affiliate of Seller in the same position as if Purchaser (or
its Subsidiaries), and not Seller or such Affiliate of Seller, had paid and
performed or were paying and performing such obligations. Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the Business, to enter into any amendment or waiver with
respect to, or exercise any renewal option or other similar provision under,
any Contract, agreement, lease or other arrangement that is then the subject
of a Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC that has the effect
of extending the term of such Contract, agreement, lease or other arrangement
beyond its current term or otherwise increasing the exposure of Seller or its
Affiliates under the applicable Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond or
Parent LofC. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
obligation to extend the term, or otherwise agree to any amendment or waiver,
of any Parent Guarantee that remains outstanding after the Closing if the
effect thereof would be to increase the exposure of Seller or its Affiliates
thereunder.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require Purchaser (or
its respective Affiliates) to, and Seller shall not, and cause its Affiliates
not to, issue (or cause or arranged to be issued) any surety bond or letter of
credit in order to (i) terminate or replace a Parent Guarantee or (ii) obtain
the beneficiarys consent to such termination or replacement.

(d) From and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller the amount
of any Pending Undrawn Claim reflected in the Indebtedness Amount that
Purchaser is paid or otherwise awarded, including in connection with any
Action related thereto (net of reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery).

 



121 Section 5.14 No Hire and Non-Solicitation of Employees.

 

(a) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will at any time prior to
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit the employment or services (whether as an employee, consultant,
independent contractor or otherwise) of any of the Transferred Employees
without Purchasers prior written consent, (ii) hire in any capacity (whether
as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any of the
Transferred Employees characterized as "Band 1", "Band 2" or "Band 3"
employees on the Employee Census or those set forth on  _Schedule 5.14(a)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, without Purchasers prior written consent or
(iii) hire in any capacity (whether as an employee, consultant, independent
contractor or otherwise) any Business Employee characterized as "Band 1",
"Band 2" or "Band 3" employees on the Employee Census or set forth on
_Schedule 5.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and who is not a
Transferred Employee, without Purchasers prior written consent; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the restrictions in the immediately preceding clause (i) shall not be
deemed breached to the extent any employee initially and entirely
independently contacts Seller or any of its Affiliates on his or her own
initiative, without any solicitation or encouragement (directly or indirectly)
by Seller or any of its Affiliates. This Section 5.14(a) shall be inapplicable
to Transferred Employees who, subsequent to the Closing Date, have (x)
been terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (A) for a period of at
least six (6) months prior to such solicitation or hiring or (B) in connection
with a broader reduction of force or layoff involving more than ten (10)
Transferred Employees as part of a single initiative or (y) terminated their
employment with the Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof with "good reason".

 

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will at any time prior to
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit the employment or services (whether as an employee, consultant,
independent contractor or otherwise) of any of the employees of Seller and its
Affiliates specified on _Schedule 5.14(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
without Sellers prior written consent or (ii) hire in any capacity (whether
as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any of the
employees of Seller and its Affiliates specified on _Schedule 5.14(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, without Sellers prior written consent; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the restrictions in the immediately preceding clause (i) shall not be
deemed breached to the extent any employee initially and
entirely independently contacts Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on his or
her own initiative, without any solicitation or encouragement (directly or
indirectly) by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. The foregoing provisions of
this Section 5.14(b) shall be inapplicable to any employee who, subsequent to
the Closing Date, has (x) been terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(A) for a period of at least six months prior to such solicitation or hiring
or (B) in connection with a broader reduction of force or layoff involving
more than ten (10) employees as part of a single initiative or (y) terminated
their employment with the Seller or an Affiliate thereof with "good reason".
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit
Purchaser and its Affiliates from engaging individual non-employee service
providers of Seller and its Affiliates who work in the operation of the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 27 of the
Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference herein as fully
as if set forth herein in their entirety and such provisions shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ and, as incorporated herein, shall not terminate upon
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



122 For purposes of this Section 5.14, (i) the term "solicit the employment or
services" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees
through media advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms,
open job fairs or otherwise; _provided_ that such searches are not focused or
targeted on Persons employed by Purchaser or Seller or their Affiliates, as
applicable, or Persons specified on _Schedule 5.14(a)_ or _Schedule 5.14(b)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as applicable, and (ii) the term "good
reason" shall mean a material diminution of such employees compensation and
benefits (determined in the aggregate) or responsibilities as an employee with
Purchaser or its Affiliates (in the case of Section 5.14(a)) or Seller or its
Affiliates (in the case of Section 5.14(b)).

Section 5.15 Non-Competition.

 

(a) Until the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete
Period_ "), Seller shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) engage in a business that competes with the Nile
Core Business as the Nile Core Business is operated on the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date by Seller and its Affiliates anywhere in the world,

Affiliates anywhere in the world, (iii) hold any voting equity interests in
any Person who engages in such activities anywhere in the world or (iv) grant

Activities") as of the Closing Date (subject in all

 



123  respects to the limitations set forth in the Intellectual Property
Agreement); _provided_ , that, the revenues for the Phoenix Optix Business do
not directly or indirectly exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate in any
consecutive twelve-month period during the Non-Compete Period;

terms and conditions for such products are Competitive, (C) include or permit
the manufacture, distribution, installation or sale of Passive Category Cable

annual sales of such Passive Category Cable Assemblies and Passive Fiber Optic
Cable Assemblies made by or on behalf of Seller and its Affiliates or
purchased from third parties do not exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate in
any consecutive twelve-month period; _provided_ , _further_ , this clause (D)
shall only apply to the extent that (x) Purchaser and its Affiliates comply

sold by Purchaser or its Affiliates to other third parties for comparable
products (adjusting for differences in lengths) with substantially similar
volumes and under similar circumstances;

 

(iv) investing in any third Person which engages in any business that engages

Persons is less than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding voting and economic
interest in such third Person;

 



124 (v) the Permitted FTTA Activity; and

 

(vi) performing obligations under the Transaction Documents.

 

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.15 shall prohibit or otherwise restrict a
Covered Person from acquiring (each, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ ") after
the date hereof an interest (whether by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase
or other business combination) in:

 

(A) a business or entity (a " _Larger Business_ ") provided that such Larger
Business (i) immediately prior to the time of such Acquisition Transaction
derives 25% or less of its annual revenue (based on the most recently
available annual consolidated financial statements of such Person or business
at the time of such Acquisition Transaction) from the Restricted Activities
and (ii) is not reasonably expected in the two-year period immediately
following the time of such Acquisition Transaction to derive more than
$125,000,000 of revenue in such two-year period from the Restricted
Activities; 

(B) a business or entity (a " _DAS Business_ ") provided that such DAS
Business (i) immediately prior to the time of such Acquisition Transaction
derives 15% or less of its annual revenue (based on the most recently
available annual consolidated financial statements of such Person or business
at the time of such Acquisition Transaction) from sales of DAS Products that
constitute Restricted Activities and (ii) is not reasonably expected in the
two-year period immediately following the time of such Acquisition Transaction
to derive more than $50,000,000 of revenue in such two-year period from sales
of DAS Products that constitute Restricted Activities;

(C) acquiring a business or entity (a " _Small Business_ ") provided that
such Small Business (i) immediately prior to the time of such Acquisition
Transaction derives 42.5% or less of its annual revenue (based on the most
recently available annual consolidated financial statements of such Person or
business at the time of such Acquisition Transaction) from the Restricted
Activities and (ii) the total aggregate amount of Small Business Revenue
during the Non-Compete Period for all Small Businesses shall not
exceed $125,000,000; or

(D) acquiring a business or entity if such Covered Person divests to an
unaffiliated third party its interest in the portion of the business that
engages in Restricted Activities acquired with such business or entity as soon
as reasonably practicable and in any event within twelve (12) months of such
Acquisition Transaction;

 

 _provided_ , _that_ , (1) in the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (C),
in the event the business or entity subject to the Acquisition Transaction
derives any revenue from sales of DAS Products that constitute Restricted
Activities, then the proposed acquisition under clauses (A) and (C) must also
satisfy the provisions of clause (B); (2) in the case of the foregoing clause
(B), in the event the business or entity subject to the Acquisition
Transaction also derives revenue from Restricted Activities (other than from
the sale of DAS Products that constitute Restricted Activities), then the
proposed acquisition under clause (B) must also satisfy the provisions of
clause (A) or clause (C); and (3) if such Covered Person divests to an
unaffiliated third party its

 



125  interest in the portion of the business that engages in Restricted
Activities acquired with the Small Business as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event within twelve (12) months of such Acquisition Transaction,
then the Small Business Revenue from such divested business that engages in
Restricted Activities shall be excluded from determining the aggregate Small
Business Revenue for purposes of clause (C) above.

 

In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.15 shall not (x) be
applicable to any Person or any of its Affiliates (other than Seller and its
Subsidiaries) that acquires an interest in Seller or its Affiliates through
any Acquisition Transaction (provided that such Person was not an Affiliate of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prior to such Acquisition Transaction) or
(y) be applicable to any Person as of and following such time that such
Person ceases to be a Covered Person.

(d) Seller hereby acknowledges that it is familiar with confidential
information of or pertaining to the Business. Seller further acknowledges and
agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 5.15 and
elsewhere in this Agreement were a material inducement to Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Seller hereby
acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.15 and
elsewhere in this Agreement are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and
area restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business
and to prevent the impairment of the value of the substantial investment
therein being made by Purchaser hereunder. The Parties agree that, if any
court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section
5.15 or other restrictive covenant in this Agreement is unreasonable,
arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical
area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by
such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may
be enforced against the applicable Party. It is agreed that any breach or
threatened breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section 5.15
or elsewhere in this Agreement would cause irreparable injury to the Business
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser.

(e) During the Non-Compete Period and for one year thereafter, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to maintain
complete and accurate records as would be reasonably necessary for Purchaser
to determine compliance by Seller with Section 5.15(a), including records of
all amounts billed by Seller or its Affiliates with respect to Restricted
Activities, as reasonably necessary to verify compliance with (i) the proviso
in Section 5.15(b)(ii), (ii) the second proviso in Section 5.15(b)(iii),
(iii) the revenue threshold in the second proviso in the definition of
Permitted FTTA Activity for purposes of Section 5.15(b)(v) and (iv) Section
5.15(c). During the Non-Compete Period and for one year thereafter, Purchaser
shall have the right to inspect and audit (or cause its Representatives to
inspect and audit) the relevant records of Seller and its Affiliates for the
purpose of verifying compliance with such provisions and Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation and support
to Purchaser and its Representatives in conducting such audit. Purchaser may
perform such an audit not more than once in any twelve (12) month period.
Purchaser shall give no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to
Seller of such audit, and each such audit shall be conducted during normal
business hours and in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to
the conduct of business by Seller or its Affiliates. If Purchaser conducts an
audit

 



126  pursuant to this Section 5.15(e) and it is determined that Seller is in
compliance, other than in any _de minimis_ respect, with (i) the proviso in
Section 5.15(b)(ii), (ii) the second proviso in Section 5.15(b)(iii), (iii)
the revenue threshold in the second proviso in the definition of Permitted
FTTA Activity for purposes of Section 5.15(b)(v) and (iv) Section 5.15(c),
then Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such audit.

(f) Purchaser also agrees to the matters set forth on _Schedule 5.15(f)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter.

Section 5.16 Post-Closing Obligations for Leases. Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Conveyed Companies) not to,
without the prior written consent of Seller, exercise any right with regard
to, or enter into, any amendment, renewal, modification or waiver of, any
Real Property Lease that could extend the term thereof beyond its then-current
term with respect to any Real Property Lease as to which Seller or one of its
Affiliates (other than a Conveyed Company) remains the leasing party, or
a guarantor, or is otherwise secondarily liable for the obligations of the
lessee, under such lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
Real Property Lease that involves a month-to-month tenancy and with respect to
which Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than a Conveyed Company) remains
the leasing party, or a guarantor or is otherwise secondarily liable, in no
event shall Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Conveyed
Companies) extend such Real Property Lease (or otherwise continue or renew
such month-to-month tenancy) later than the date that is twenty four (24)
months after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
prevent Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Conveyed
Companies) from seeking a novation of, or entering into a new lease for the
Leased Real Property (or portion thereof) relating to, any Real Property Lease
as to which Seller (or any of its Affiliates) remains the leasing party, or
a guarantor, or is otherwise secondarily liable for the obligations of the
lessee under such lease so long as such novation or new lease does not involve
or entail any Liability or obligation of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than a Conveyed Company) (as guarantor or otherwise).

Section 5.17 Confidentiality.

 

(a) Each party agrees to continue to abide by the Confidentiality Agreement
and the CT Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated by
reference in this Agreement and which terms will survive until the Closing, at
which time, the Confidentiality Agreement (other than those provisions
restricting the use and disclosure of Purchasers or its
Affiliates Evaluation Material (as defined therein), which will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms) and the CT
Confidentiality Agreement will each terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement and CT Confidentiality Agreement will continue in
full force and effect until terminated in accordance with their respective
terms. Except as contemplated by Section 10.7, the existence of this
Agreement and the terms hereof and thereof (including the Exhibits and
Schedules appended hereto and thereto and the Seller Disclosure Letter) will
be deemed " _Evaluation Material_ ," as defined in, and pursuant to the terms
of, and subject to the exceptions contained in, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



127 (b) From and after the Closing for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing
Date, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or in any
Transaction Document, Seller (x) shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to, at any time disclose to any Person (other than
Purchaser and its Affiliates) or use (except as may be necessary to enforce
its rights hereunder) any Confidential Information of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or Confidential Information acquired by Purchaser or its Permitted
Designees pursuant to Section 2.2(h) (" _Purchaser Confidential Information_
"), whether or not such information is embodied in writing or other physical
form and (y) shall, and shall direct its Affiliates and Representatives to
(and be responsible for any breach thereof), hold in strict confidence, and
treat as confidential, all such Purchaser Confidential Information; _provided_
, _that_ , the foregoing shall not (1) limit in any respect the proviso in
Section 2.2(h)(i), (2) apply to information acquired by Purchaser or its
Permitted Designees pursuant to Section 2.2(h)(ii) to the extent relating to
Sellers or its Affiliates businesses other than the Business or (3) apply to
the extent that such disclosure or use (i) is required by applicable Law (
_provided_ , _that_ , in such case, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with
and provide Purchaser an opportunity to object to the disclosure and give
Purchaser as much prior written notice as is reasonably possible under the
circumstances, only disclose such information to the extent required by Law
and, upon request by Purchaser, use reasonable efforts, at Purchasers
expense, to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to any such information required by Law to be disclosed), (ii) is to
an Affiliate or Representative of Seller who has a need to know
such information for a purpose not prohibited by this Section 5.17(b) and is
informed of its obligation to not use such information and to hold such
information confidential, in each case, to the same extent as is applicable to
the Seller and in respect of whose failure to comply with such obligations
Seller will be responsible or (iii) is of non-confidential information. Non-
confidential information for purposes of this Section 5.17(b) shall mean
information (A) that is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by Seller or an Affiliate or Representative
thereof in breach of any confidentiality obligation, (B) that becomes
available to Seller or an Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof;
provided that such source is not known by Seller to be bound by any obligation
of confidentiality to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Conveyed Companies) or (C) that Seller can establish by reasonable evidence is
independently developed by Seller or any Affiliate thereof without reference
to or reliance upon Purchaser Confidential Information.

 

(c) From and after the Closing for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing
Date, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or in any
Transaction Document, Purchaser (x) shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives not to, at any time disclose to any Person (other than
Seller and its Affiliates) or use (except as may be necessary to enforce its
rights hereunder) any Confidential Information of Seller or its Affiliates
described in Section 2.3(a)(iii)(B) or Section 2.2(h)(ii) or Confidential
Information of Seller or its Affiliates disclosed prior to Closing by
Seller or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, in each case,
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and any Confidential Information of Seller or its Affiliates obtained
in connection with any audit pursuant to Section 5.15(e) (" _Seller
Confidential Information_ "), whether or not such information is embodied in
writing or other physical form and (y) shall, and shall direct its Affiliates
and Representatives to (and be responsible for any breach thereof), hold in
strict confidence, and treat as confidential, all such Seller Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing shall not

 



128  (1) apply to information to the extent relating to the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or (2) apply to the extent that
such disclosure or use (i) is required by applicable Law ( _provided_ ,
_that_ , in such case, to the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with and provide
Seller an opportunity to object to the disclosure and give Seller as much
prior written notice as is reasonably possible under the circumstances, only
disclose such information to the extent required by Law and, upon request by
Seller, use reasonable efforts, at Sellers expense, to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such information
required by Law to be disclosed), (ii) is to an Affiliate or Representative of
Purchaser who has a need to know such information for a purpose
not prohibited by this Section 5.17(c) and is informed of its obligation to
not use such information and to hold such information confidential, in each
case, to the same extent as is applicable to the Purchaser and in respect of
whose failure to comply with such obligations Purchaser will be responsible
or (iii) is of non-confidential information. Non-confidential information for
purposes of this Section 5.17(c) shall mean information (A) that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by
Purchaser or an Affiliate or Representative thereof in breach of any
confidentiality obligation, (B) that is or becomes available to Purchaser or
an Affiliate thereof on a non-confidential basis from a source other than

establish by reasonable evidence is independently developed by Purchaser or
any Affiliate thereof without reference to or reliance upon any Seller
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
Section 27 of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated by
reference herein as fully as if set forth herein in their entirety and such
provisions shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ and, as incorporated herein,
shall not terminate upon termination of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.18 Assumed Liabilities Covered by Seller Insurance. With respect to
(a) events relating to the Assumed Liabilities or losses or (b) damages
related to the Purchased Assets or the Conveyed Companies or their assets,
each of which occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date and which are
covered by Sellers or its Affiliates occurrence-based third-party liability
insurance policies, (i) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any matter
that is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim under any such policy (
_provided_ , _that_ , the failure to promptly notify Seller shall not relieve
Seller from its obligations under clause (ii), except to the extent that
Sellers ability to pursue such claim or recover under such policies
is actually and materially prejudiced thereby), and (ii) Purchaser may make
claims, or Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to make claims, under
such policies to the extent such coverage and limits are available under such
policies and any insurance proceeds received with respect thereto shall be
promptly delivered to Purchaser or its Permitted Designee. Seller agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all such claims; _provided_
, _however_ , that Purchaser shall exclusively bear (and Seller shall have no
obligation to repay or reimburse Purchaser for) the amount of any deductibles
associated with claims made under such policies and programs except to the
extent Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII.
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in connection with making such claim and
each Party shall provide the other with all reasonably requested information
necessary to make such claim. Promptly after the Closing Seller shall have
Purchaser and its Affiliates named as (a) additional insureds under the
Sellers or its Affiliates occurrence-based third-party liability insurance
policies with respect to events relating to the Assumed Liabilities or
the Conveyed Companies or their assets that occurred or existed prior to the
Closing and (b) named as loss payee parties under the Sellers or its
Affiliates first-party insurance currently in force.

 



129 Section 5.19 Financing.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and to
consummate the Debt Financing (or, at the option of Purchaser, an
equity offering in lieu of any portion of the Debt Financing) on the terms
and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, which shall include
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments and to negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing on terms that, when taken as a whole, are not materially
less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser than those contained in the
Financing Commitments (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto),
which terms shall not in any material respect expand on the conditions to the
Closing or to the funding at the Closing of the Debt Financing (the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely
basis all conditions in the Financing Commitments and the Financing Agreements
that are to be satisfied by Purchaser and in its control and necessary to
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iii) enforce its
rights under the Financing Commitments and Financing Agreements, including
through litigation pursued in good faith, (iv) consummate the Debt Financing
at the Closing, including using reasonable best efforts to (in the event that
all conditions in the Financing Commitments are satisfied) cause the Financing
Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing and (v) comply with its
obligations under the Financing Commitments. In the event any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Financing Commitments (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto)
and/or the Financing Agreements, or Purchaser becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Debt
Financing unavailable, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain promptly, on terms that are not materially less favorable
to Purchaser than the Debt Financing contemplated by such Financing
Commitments (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto) and/or
Financing Agreements, as applicable, any such portion from alternative sources
in an amount, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that is
available, equal to the amount of Debt Financing committed on the date hereof
pursuant to the Financing Commitments (" _Alternative Financing_ ") and to
obtain, and, when obtained, to provide Seller with a copy of, a new financing
commitment and related fee letter (which fee letter may be redacted as
specified in the "Redacted Fee Letter" definition) that provides for such
Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ ");
_provided_ , _that_ , after giving effect to any such Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter and assuming the references therein to the Financing
Commitments and Debt Financing are references to the Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter and Alternative Financing, respectively, the representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth in Section 4.5 shall be true and correct
in all material respects on and as of such date with the same effect as
though made on and as of such date. If applicable, other than in the
immediately preceding sentence, any reference in this Agreement to "Debt
Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing," any reference to "Financing
Commitments" or "Financing Commitment" shall include the "Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter," any references to "Financing Sources" and
"Financing Source" shall include the source of any "Alternative Financing"
and any reference to "Financing Agreements" shall include any "Alternative
Financing Agreements."

 



130 (b) Purchaser shall provide to Seller prompt written notice (i) of any breach
or default (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any
party to the Financing Commitments and/or the Financing Agreements if such
breach or default would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or the amount of, the Debt Financing and (ii) of the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any party to the
Financing Commitments and/or the Financing Agreements with respect to (x) any
breach, default or repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments
and/or the Financing Agreements or (y) any dispute or disagreement as to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing, or as to the satisfaction
of conditions to or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded, at
Closing, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or the amount of, the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that in no
event will Purchaser be under any obligation to disclose any information that
is subject to attorney-client, work product or similar privilege if Purchaser
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a
way that would not waive such privilege. Purchaser shall from time to time
keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall not,
without Sellers prior written consent, permit any amendment, modification or
supplement to be made to, or any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under
the Financing Commitments and/or the Financing Agreements which would (1)
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Purchasers ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) reduce the aggregate cash
amount of the Debt Financing available to be funded at the Closing (including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Debt Financing (except as set forth in any flex provisions existing on the
date hereof)), (3) impose new or additional conditions or amend, modify or
expand upon (unless such new conditions or amendment, modification or
expansion would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing or make the funding of any portion of the
Debt Financing or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining the Debt
Financing materially less likely to occur) the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing as set forth in any of the Financing Commitments or (4) impair,
delay (taking into account the Marketing Period) or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments_ "); provided, that subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 5.19(b), Purchaser may amend the
Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller
copies of any proposed Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment (in redacted
form as specified in the "Redacted Fee Letter" definition with respect to any
fee letters); _provided_ that in no event will Purchaser be under any
obligation to disclose such information and documentation if Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in litigation and such information is
reasonably pertinent to the litigated dispute (for the avoidance of doubt,
it being understood that this proviso shall in no way limit the right of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to obtain discovery with respect to any matter
in connection with any such litigation to the extent such discovery would
otherwise be permitted in connection with such dispute).

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall, on or prior
to the Closing Date, take the actions described on _Schedule C_ (as may be
amended in accordance with this Section 5.20). _Schedule C_ may be amended by
Seller without the consent of Purchaser: (i) to comply with applicable Laws;
and/or (ii) to secure the consent or approval of a Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and/or (iii) to add transfers of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities from the Conveyed Companies to Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Conveyed Company) by dividend,
distribution, sale, payment of intercompany advances or Indebtedness, or other
transfer; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such amendment shall require the
prior written consent of Purchaser if any such proposed amendment includes
any steps or actions that would (A) cause Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to violate any Law or Contract, (B) cause any representation or warranty of
Seller in Article III of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect in any
material respect, (C) other than in any _de minimis_ respect, create or result
in any increase in any Assumed Liabilities or any other Liabilities or
obligations of Purchaser with respect to which Purchaser is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (including any incremental transfer
Taxes required to be paid by Purchaser hereunder, other than any transfer
Taxes reasonably likely to be recovered within two (2) years by Purchaser or
its Affiliates under applicable Law without material cost or expense or
restructuring or the implementation of further Tax planning techniques by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates), (D) create or give rise to any material
loans or balances (x) between any Conveyed Company, on one hand, and another
Conveyed Company, on the other hand, or (y) between any Conveyed Company, on
one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Conveyed Companies), on the other hand, that would not be canceled or
terminated without further liability or obligation on or before the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement, (E) (x) reduce the paid in capital, statutory
capital or other local Law equivalent with respect to any Conveyed Company
below (A) the amount required by applicable Statutory Minimums with respect to
such Conveyed Company or (B) an amount which would result in Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates being required by applicable Law to contribute additional
capital to such Conveyed Company, or (y) result in negative equity or negative
retained earnings, distributable reserves or other local Law equivalent, (F)
involve entering into any covenant or agreement with any Taxing Authority
that would bind Purchaser or any Conveyed Company in any material respect with
respect to any period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
(G) other than in any _de minimis_ respect, have any adverse Tax impact on
Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or any Conveyed Company, or (H) other than
in any _de minimis_ respect, impose restrictions or limitations on Purchaser,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Conveyed Company not otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement (taking into account the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ _that_ , in each case, no such consent shall be
required to the extent (X) Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.6 or Article VIII for Losses arising out of such proposed
amendment and (Y) Seller acknowledges in writing such indemnity obligation
with respect to the full amount of any Loss resulting therefrom. With respect
to any amendments to _Schedule C_ proposed by Seller that do not require
Purchasers consent pursuant to this Section 5.20, Seller shall in good faith
consult with Purchaser as to such proposed amendment. To the extent Purchaser
has any concerns with any such amendment proposed by Seller, Purchaser shall
provide to Seller any information available to Purchaser that is reasonably
requested in writing by Seller to enable Seller to understand the impact of
such amendment on Purchaser, its

 



134  Subsidiaries or any Conveyed Company, and Seller shall consider in good
faith suggestions by Purchaser. Without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld),
Seller shall not take any valuation positions in the Restructuring that would
restrict Purchasers ability to negotiate the Allocation. Any executed
documents, instruments or certificates (or forms thereof) that would be
considered Purchased Assets or assets of a Conveyed Company, (X) shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (consistent with this
Agreement), (Y) other than in any _de minimis_ respect, shall not impose
Liabilities, restrictions or limitations on Purchaser or the Conveyed
Companies not contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities by Purchaser) and (Z) shall be made available to
Purchaser promptly following their completion. Prior to Closing Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) take such actions necessary so that
Codenoll Technology Corporation does not constitute a Conveyed Company and
that none of its equity interests are held by any other Conveyed Company and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate and dissolve each of the
entities set forth on _Schedule 5.20(a)_ , in each case, without any
continuing Liability to the Conveyed Companies (or, after the Closing,

"Purchased Assets" or "Excluded Assets," Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, in consultation with the other party,
use commercially reasonable efforts to identify the internal separation
activities necessary for the Business to operate in a manner independent from
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Companies) and for the
businesses (other than the Business) of Seller and its Affiliates (other than
the Conveyed Companies) to operate independently of the Business. Further,
upon the reasonable request of the other party, Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, subject to applicable Law,
provide reasonable cooperation to the other party in (x) effecting such
separation activities such that the Business can operate in a manner
independent from Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Companies)
at or promptly after the Closing and (y) taking such other actions to
otherwise reduce the term of services required by Purchaser and its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Companies) (or, with respect to any services provided
by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Companies) to Seller
or its Affiliates, required by Seller and its Affiliates) under the Transition
Services Agreement, including, in the case of Seller, reasonable access to
information for Purchaser to market insurance coverage for the Business to be
effective as of Closing, using reasonable best efforts to assist with data
extraction, data migration (including product catalog data, employee master

and Health Reimbursement Arrangement, in the form of data extracts) and
similar matters and reasonably cooperating with Purchaser in facilitating
Purchasers efforts to migrate Transferred Employees to its payroll
and benefits plans, systems and processes, which cooperation shall include
providing Purchaser, subject to applicable Law, with reasonable access to
information, books, records and personnel reasonably requested in connection
with such efforts (including information relating to the Business Employees
and Shared Service Employees or the benefits and compensation from time to
time provided to the Business Employees and Shared Service Employees),
including (A) providing reasonable access to the personnel of Seller and its
Affiliates during normal business hours and on at least five Business Days

concerning and preparing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (C) providing reasonable access to local information
technology personnel to provide data or interface layouts for local
requirements, (D) directing third party service providers to the Business to

Purchaser to establish Benefit Plans for Transferred Employees (including such
plans which mirror the terms of the existing Business Benefit
Plans), including reasonably assisting Purchaser and its Affiliates to obtain
timely access to current vendors or suppliers with respect to the Business
Benefit Plans and (F) otherwise providing reasonable cooperation and
assistance to Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective representatives
as may be necessary to allow Purchaser to comply with its obligations under
Section 5.5. Until the Closing, Purchaser shall consult with Seller and obtain
Sellers consent before distributing any communications to any Business
Employee or Shared Service Employee (including pursuant to the announcements
described in the preceding clause (B)), whether relating to employee benefits,
post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise. Seller shall provide Purchaser
with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on (and shall
consider in good faith all such comments), all material communications to any
Business Employee or Shared Service Employee relating to post-
Closing employee benefits and terms of employment.

pertinent information regarding the activities contemplated or taken in
accordance with or pursuant to this Agreement. The Parties shall reasonably
determine the membership of the Steering Committee, provided that the
Steering Committee shall include member representatives from Seller, the
Business and the Purchaser. The Steering Committee shall meet on a regular
basis, in person or by telephone conference at a schedule to be determined by
the Steering Committee itself, but no less than twice per month. The Steering
Committee shall not have decision making authority with respect to either
Party and shall not bind any Party, or otherwise affect the rights, remedies
or obligations of any Party hereunder.

of all agreements set forth on _Schedule 3.15(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure

5.23(b); _provided_ , _that_ , in no event will Seller, and Seller will cause
its Affiliates not to, make any agreement that would increase Purchasers or
any of its Affiliates Liabilities or obligations hereunder without

applicable, are complete under applicable Law, Seller may, at its sole option
(for each jurisdiction, a " _Put Option_ ") determine to sell, transfer and
assign (and shall procure that an Affiliate, as applicable, shall sell,
transfer and assign) to Purchaser or the relevant Permitted Designee all of
Sellers and any of its Affiliates right, title and interest in and to the

such event, shall encourage all Business Employees in each such jurisdiction
to transfer to or continue employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate as part
of the sale of such Purchased Assets or such Conveyed Entities; _provided_ ,
_that_ , nothing herein shall be interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its
Affiliates to provide any Business Employee with any additional compensation
or benefits to incent such Person to transfer to or continue employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliate as part of the sale of such Purchased Assets or
such Conveyed Entities. Upon Sellers exercise of a Put Option, the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Assets or Conveyed Entities in such Put Option
jurisdiction shall be deemed a part of and undertaken on the same terms and
conditions as the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets under Section 2.2
of this Agreement or as the case may be, the purchase and sale of the Conveyed
Entities under Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 of this Agreement, and the transfer
of the Business Employees in each such jurisdiction shall be in accordance
with Section 5.5 of this Agreement. In case of concerns raised by a union,
works council or other employee representative group in any of France, New
Zealand, the Netherlands or Sweden in connection with the purchase and sale of
the Purchased Assets in any such country in accordance with this Section
5.23(b), which could reasonably be addressed by updates, modifications or
amendments to this Agreement, including Section 2.2 or Section 5.5 or any
Schedule to this Agreement to the extent related to the Purchased Assets in
any such country, the Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
with respect to any such updates, modifications or amendments designed to

purpose of this Agreement and the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets in
such country.

 

Section 5.24 Intercompany Agreements and Accounts. Except for the Transaction

Receivables and as specifically set forth _Schedule 5.24_ (a) all
intercompany arrangements and agreements (whether written or oral) between
Seller and its Affiliates (including any Conveyed Company), on one hand, and
any one or more of the Conveyed Companies, on the other hand, shall be
terminated and of no further force and effect (without further Liability to
any party thereto) after the Closing (other than Commingled Contracts, which
are addressed in Section 2.7(e), and Commingled Leases, which are addressed
in Section 2.7(f)) and (b) prior to the

 



138  Closing, Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates (including any of the
Conveyed Companies) to terminate or pay in full (and in accordance with the
proviso of the first sentence of Section 5.2(b)) all outstanding intercompany
accounts, whether payables or receivables, between Seller and its Affiliates,
on one hand, and any of the Conveyed Companies, on the other hand (including
any intercompany accounts between any Conveyed Company, on one hand, and
another Conveyed Company, on the other hand) such that no such amounts are
owed or outstanding as of the Closing. Following the Closing, (a) Seller will
pay or cause an Affiliate to pay all Assumed Intercompany Receivables in full
when due, and (b) Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
assign any interest in any Assumed Intercompany Payables (other than
assignments (i) to any Affiliate of Seller, (ii) as part of a _bona fide_
accounts receivable financing involving the Assumed Intercompany Payables and
other accounts receivable of Seller or its Affiliates entered into in the
ordinary course of business or (iii) following the failure of Seller
to collect such Assumed Intercompany Payables despite the use of commercially
reasonable efforts). Following the Closing, (a) Purchaser will pay or cause an
Affiliate to pay all Assumed Intercompany Payables in full when due, and (b)
Purchaser will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, assign any interest

financing involving the Assumed Intercompany Receivables and other accounts
receivable of Purchaser or its Affiliates entered into in the ordinary course
of business or (iii) following the failure of Purchaser to collect such
Assumed Intercompany Receivables despite the use of commercially reasonable
efforts).

(a) furnish information, (b) execute and deliver documents, and (c) do any
other acts and things, in each case as the other Party may reasonably require

the other Transaction Documents and effecting the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or another Transaction
Document or the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under Section 7.6 or Article VIII with respect to such matter). Further, in
the event that, on or after the Closing, either Party receives payments or
funds due or belonging to the other pursuant to the terms hereof or any of the
Transaction Documents, then the Party receiving such payments or funds shall
promptly forward or cause to be promptly forwarded such payments or funds to
the proper party (with appropriate endorsements, as applicable), and will
account to such other Party for all such receipts. The Parties acknowledge
and agree there is no right of offset regarding such payments and a Party may
not withhold funds received from third parties for the account of the other
Party in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.25, Seller agrees that Purchaser shall, following
the Closing, have the right and authority to endorse any checks or drafts
received by Purchaser in respect of any account receivable of the Business
included in the Purchased Assets or reflected in the Final Closing Working
Capital and Seller shall furnish Purchaser such evidence of this authority as
Purchaser may reasonably request.

acquired ownership or any right to convey any of the United States Patents or
United States Trademarks assigned to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller also agrees that, upon Purchasers request, Seller or its designee will
take commercially reasonable efforts to record in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office, at its own expense, any release of a security agreement

not been previously recorded therein against any of the United States
Patents or United States Trademarks assigned to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement.

review and (y) the Year End Financial Statements shall have been audited by
the Sellers independent auditors in accordance with AICPA auditing standards.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall reimburse

Affiliates as of the Closing, (ii) was in the management and control (which
includes payment of expenses and annuities as set forth in Section 2.2(f)) of
the Business as of the date hereof or as of the Closing, and (iii) was not

to have been retained by, and owned by, Seller as of the Closing for all
purposes, including purposes of the Intellectual Property Agreement (and (1)
with respect to Patents, the Intellectual Property Agreement shall be
interpreted to reflect that such Patent was "Seller Licensed IP", "Retained
Materials IP" or "Retained Hardened Connectivity Patents", as applicable, and

Purchaser, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.3(a) and Section 6.3(b) have been satisfied.

(d) _Document Delivery_. The actions set forth in Section 2.11(b) (other than
clauses (viii)(B) thereof and, with respect to jurisdictions not identified in
item 2 on _Schedule D,_ clauses (ii) and (viii)(A) thereof) shall have been
completed.

 

Section 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of Purchaser or Seller may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VI to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such Partys failure to act in good
faith or such Partys failure to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur, as required by Section 5.3.

 



150 ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.1 Allocation of Taxes to Seller. Seller shall be responsible for and
will pay or cause to be paid any and all of the following (collectively, "
_Seller s Taxes_"):

(a) all Taxes imposed on the Conveyed Companies or attributable to
any Purchased Asset with respect to Pre-Closing Periods and all Taxes imposed
on Seller, the Equity Selling Entities and the Asset Selling Entities;

 

(b) all Liability for Income Taxes of Seller or any other Person (other than a
Conveyed Company) imposed on the Conveyed Companies as a result of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or under any consolidation, combination, fiscal
unity, or similar regime by any U.S. or foreign federal, state or local Tax
Law for all Pre-Closing Periods or the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period;

(c) Sellers portion of the Taxes for any Straddle Period, as determined under
Section 7.3;

 

(d) all Liability for Taxes that are imposed on the Conveyed Companies
pursuant to (i) any Tax Sharing Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the June 29, 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement) or (ii) any other Contract of
the Conveyed Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods or the pre-Closing portion
of any Straddle Period;

 

(e) any Transfer Taxes borne by Seller pursuant to Section 7.13; and

 

(f) any Taxes (for the avoidance of doubt, including any VATs or any transfer
Taxes) imposed on the Conveyed Companies as a result of the Restructuring or
the transfers contemplated by Section 5.3(vi).

_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers Taxes shall not include (i) any Taxes
arising as a result of actions taken by any Conveyed Company or the Purchaser
or any of their Affiliates outside of the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing (other than (x) any action or transaction
contemplated under this Agreement including actions taken pursuant to Section
5.20 or Section 5.24, the Section 338(h)(10) Election or the Section 338(g)
Elections, (y) actions taken at the direction of Seller or (z) actions
required by applicable Law) (a " _Purchaser Tax Act_ ") or (ii) any liability
for Taxes to the extent such Taxes are accrued Taxes described in Section
2.4(d). For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of the Tax matters set
forth on _Schedule 3.16_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not alter
Sellers indemnification obligations for Sellers Taxes, and Seller shall
indemnify Purchaser for all Losses arising from or related to such matters to
the extent provided in Section 7.6. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any VATs, transfer Taxes or any other Taxes attributable to
the Restructuring, in each case, that are actually recovered by Purchaser
or its Affiliates, shall be subject to Section 7.7 of this Agreement and the
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any recovery or

 



151  refund with respect to any such Taxes and to cooperate with Seller in
providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to
obtain such recovery or refund. For the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable
efforts shall not include any change to the operations of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or require Purchaser or its Affiliates to implement any further Tax
planning techniques to obtain any such recovery or refund. To the extent
costs are incurred to recover a Tax for the benefit of Seller, the recovery or
refund paid to Seller shall be net of such cost pursuant to Section 7.7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, references to
Taxes in this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to include amounts that would have
constituted Taxes but for the set-off or other utilization of any loss,
deduction or credit of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in each case
unrelated to the amounts at issue, realized in or attributable to a taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.2 Allocation of Taxes to Purchaser. Except to the extent subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.6(b), Purchaser shall be responsible
for, will pay or cause to be paid, any and all of the following (collectively,
" _Purchaser s Taxes_"):

 

(a) Taxes relating to the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes described in Section 2.4(d)),
other than those allocated to Seller pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 7.3;

(b) any Transfer Taxes borne by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.13; and

(c) any Taxes resulting from any Purchaser Tax Act;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers Taxes shall not include any Taxes
to the extent a current asset attributable to such Taxes was included in
Final Closing Working Capital.

Section 7.3 Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes.

 

(a) With respect to any taxable period of a Conveyed Company relating to Taxes
that would (absent an election) begin on or before and end after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Seller shall or shall cause such Conveyed
Company to elect with any relevant Taxing Authority to close such Straddle
Period as of the end of the day on the Closing Date to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. As a result of such election, Taxes will be allocated to
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, respectively, taking into account such
election to close such Straddle Period as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date.

(b) In any case of any Income Taxes where the Straddle Period of a Conveyed
Company is not or cannot be closed pursuant to Section 7.3(a), Seller will be
allocated any Income Taxes imposed on the Conveyed Company for the portion of
the Straddle Period up to and ending on the Closing Date. For purposes
of this Section 7.3(b), Income Taxes for the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date will be determined based upon an interim closing of
the books of such Conveyed Company as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date based
upon Tax accounting methods, practices and procedures last used by such
Conveyed Company in preparing its Tax Returns.

 



152 (c) As to any Tax (other than a Transfer Tax covered by Section 7.13) for any
Straddle Period that is not covered by Sections 7.3(a) and (b) above, the
amount of such Tax allocable to Seller shall be:

 

(i) for any such Tax that is determined based upon specific transactions
(including value added, sales, and use Taxes), all such Taxes applicable to
transactions that have been consummated during the period through the end of
the Closing Date (except to the extent such Taxes are attributable to a
Purchaser Tax Act); and

 

(ii) for any such Tax that is not based upon specific transactions (including
license, real property, personal property, franchise and doing business
Taxes), the amount of such Tax equal to the full amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

Section 7.4 Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Selling Entities, the Asset
Selling Entities, and/or the Conveyed Companies to, prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, within applicable statutory limits all Tax
Returns of or that include the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets
(including any amendments thereto) that are due to be filed (giving effect to
any extension of time to file) on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall,
and shall cause the Equity Selling Entities and/or the Conveyed Companies to,
pay all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns when due. To the extent that
Seller or its Affiliates are required to file Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to this Agreement,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Selling Entities, the Asset Selling
Entities and the Conveyed Companies to, permit Purchaser to review and
comment on any portion of any Tax Returns related to the determination of any
such Transfer Tax, and Seller shall, and shall cause the Equity Selling
Entities, the Asset Selling Entities, and/or the Conveyed Companies to, make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Purchaser
and are consistent with past practice. Purchaser shall pay over to Seller, no
fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Transfer
Tax Return, an amount of cash sufficient for the payment of any Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Return and for which Purchaser bears responsibility pursuant
to Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns relating to the Conveyed
Companies that are due to be filed (giving effect to any extensions of time to
file) after the Closing Date, including Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing
Period. In preparing such Tax Returns, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
any of its Affiliates not to, make any changes to any position taken in any
prior taxable year (unless required by applicable Law) that would materially
affect Seller or its Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, pay or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to such Tax
Returns when due. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to permit
Seller to review and comment on any Tax Returns of any of the Conveyed
Companies that are filed after the Closing Date pursuant to which Seller is
responsible for Taxes pursuant to Section 7.1 of this Agreement, and Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make such

 



153  revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller and are
consistent with past practice; _provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser will only be
required to take the position advocated by the Seller if Seller delivers an
opinion of a nationally recognized law or accounting firm that Sellers
proposed position is "more likely than not" to prevail if challenged by the
IRS or other Governmental Authority. The cost of the "more likely than not"
opinion is to be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent
(50%) by Seller. Seller shall, and shall cause, as applicable, the Equity
Selling Entities and/or the Asset Selling Entities to pay over to Purchaser,
no fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date of the applicable
Tax Return, an amount of cash sufficient for the payment of any Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Return and for which Seller bears responsibility pursuant to
Section 7.1 of this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser agrees that, to the extent able to do so under applicable Law
and requested to do so by Seller, Purchaser and any of its relevant Affiliates
shall, at Sellers expense, carry back any item of loss, deduction, or credit
of the Conveyed Companies or Purchased Assets attributable to any taxable
period with respect to which Seller is liable for Taxes pursuant to Section
7.1 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.4(c) or in
any other provision of this Agreement shall require Purchaser or any of
its relevant Affiliates to carry back any item of loss, deduction, or credit
with respect to the Conveyed Companies or Purchased Assets arising from the
operation of the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets for periods
following the Closing Date. 

(d) Purchaser agrees that, with respect to each Conveyed Company and any
successor thereto:

 

(i) except as provided in Section 7.7(c), neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates nor any successors thereto will file any claim for refund of Taxes
in respect of (a) any Pre-Closing Period, or (b) in the case of a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;

 

(ii) Purchaser, its Affiliates, and any successors thereto must make any
elections available to them to waive the right to claim in respect of any
Pre-Closing Period any carryback with respect to Taxes arising in (a) any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, or (b) in the case of a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date;

(iii) Purchaser, its Affiliates, and any successors thereto shall not make or
permit to be made any affirmative elections to claim (a) in respect of any
Pre-Closing Period, or (b) in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, any carryback in respect of a
Tax arising in (x) any period beginning after the Closing Date, or (y) in the
case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date; and

 

(iv) except as required by Law, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
nor any successors thereto will file any amended Tax Return in respect of (A)
a Pre-Closing Period, or (B) in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, in each case without the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld.

 



154 Section 7.5 Tax Contests.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall provide prompt notice to the other of any
pending or threatened Contest of which it or any Affiliate becomes aware
related to Taxes for any taxable period for which it is indemnified by the
other Party hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known) describing any asserted Tax Liability in reasonable detail and
shall be accompanied by copies of any notice and other material documents it
has received from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such matters. If a
Party or any Affiliate has knowledge of an asserted Tax Liability with respect
to a matter for which such Party is to be indemnified under Section 7.6
hereof and such Party fails to give the indemnifying Party prompt notice of
such asserted Tax Liability. The failure to provide such prompt notice or
other documents or information shall relieve the indemnifying Party of any
Liability that it may have to the indemnified Party only to the extent that
the indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) Seller or its designee shall have the right to represent a Conveyed
Companys interests in any Contest relating to a Tax matter arising with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period to the extent such Contest is in connection
with any Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof,
to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and to control the conduct
of such Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have the right, at Purchasers
own expense, to consult with Seller regarding and to participate fully in all
aspects of the prosecution and defense of any such Contest; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any settlement or other disposition of any such Contest that
may affect Purchaser or any Affiliate for any taxable period beginning after
the Closing Date or any portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date may only be made with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In
the case of any such Contest, in the event that Purchaser unreasonably
withholds, delays or conditions consent in violation of the preceding
sentence, Seller shall be relieved of its obligation under Section 7.6(b) to
indemnify Purchaser for any Tax with respect to such Contest only to
the extent that Seller is actually prejudiced thereby.

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct of any Contest
relating to a Tax matter of a Conveyed Company arising with respect to a
taxable period ending after the Closing Date and of any Contest in respect of
which Seller has not elected to represent the interests of a Conveyed Company
pursuant to Section 7.5(b);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have
the right, at Sellers own expense, to consult with Purchaser regarding and to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution and defense of any such
Contest that may affect a Conveyed Company for any Pre-Closing Period or for
any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any settlement or other disposition of any such Contest that
may affect a Conveyed Company for any Pre-Closing Period or any portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date may only be made with the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. In the case of any such Contest, in the event that
Seller unreasonably withholds, delays or conditions consent in violation of
the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall be relieved of its obligation under
Section 7.6(c) to indemnify Seller for any Tax with respect to such Contest
only to the extent that the Purchaser is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



155 (d) As with all other Tax disputes under this Agreement, it is understood by
the Parties that any disputes arising under this Section 7.5, including
disputes regarding consent being unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, shall constitute disputes regarding matters in this Article VII
that require the agreement of the Parties within the meaning of Section 7.10
of this Agreement and, therefore, shall be resolved in accordance with Section
7.10 of this Agreement.

 

(e) Seller and Purchaser agree, in each case at no cost to the other Party, to
cooperate with the other and the others Representatives in a prompt and
timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include,
but not be limited to, making available to the other Party, during normal
business hours, all books, records, Tax Returns, documents, files,
other information (including working papers and schedules), officers or
employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant
information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any
such books, records and files.

(f) Where there is a dispute with a Taxing Authority regarding Liability for
Tax for a Pre-Closing Period and for which Seller has an indemnification
obligation, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the appropriate Conveyed Company
to, as the case may be, at the request of the Seller, pay the amount of the
disputed Tax to the Taxing Authority; _provided_ _that_ Seller has provided
Purchaser or the Conveyed Company with sufficient funds to make such payment
of such disputed Tax.

Section 7.6 Indemnification.

(a) The indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 7.6 are the
exclusive remedy for obligations of the Parties arising under this Agreement
that relate to Taxes and Article VIII of this Agreement shall not apply to
such obligations, other than the survival provisions set forth in Section 8.1
and the expressly applicable loss limitation provisions of Sections 8.4
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes the Per-Claim Deductible, the
General Basket and the Cap, which shall not limit the indemnification under
this Section 7.6) and 8.5.

 

(b) Seller shall be liable for, and covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against, any and all
Losses incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates:

(i) by reason of the failure of any of the representations contained in
Section 3.16 hereof to be true and correct on the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date (determined without giving effect to any "material,"
"materiality," "material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of
similar impact or effect therein);

(ii) by reason of a breach by Seller of any covenant contained in this
Article VII; and

(iii) for Sellers Taxes for which Seller bears responsibility pursuant to
Section 7.1 hereof.

 



156 (c) Except to the extent subject to indemnification pursuant to Section
7.6(b), Purchaser shall be liable for, and covenants and agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any and all
Losses incurred by any of Seller or its Affiliates:

 

(i) by reason of a breach by Purchaser of any covenant contained in this
Article VII; and

 

(ii) for Purchasers Taxes for which Purchaser bears responsibility pursuant
to Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

 

(d) If a Party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") determines that it or any of
its Affiliates is or may be entitled to indemnification by another Party (the
" _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") under Section 7.6(b) or Section 7.6(c) hereof,
the Tax Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party
a written notice and demand therefor (the " _Tax Notice_ ") specifying the
basis for indemnification and, if known, the amount for which the Tax
Indemnified Party reasonably believes it or any of its Affiliates is entitled
to be indemnified (a " _Tax Claim_ "), together with any material supporting
documentation (including, if applicable, any relevant notice from any Taxing
Authority). The Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying Party no
later than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the applicable Tax
statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Tax Indemnified
Party does not receive notice from the applicable Taxing Authority (" _Taxing
Authority Notice_ ") that an item exists that could give rise to a Tax Claim
more than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the applicable Tax statute
of limitations, then the Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the
Taxing Authority Notice (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the Taxing Authority Notice).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, in no event
will the failure to timely provide any Tax Notice or other documents or
information relieve the Tax Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may
have to the Tax Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Tax
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. If the Tax
Indemnifying Party objects to the Tax Claim in the manner set forth in Section
7.6(e) hereof or if either the Tax Indemnifying Party or the Tax Indemnified
Party exercises Contest rights as contemplated by Section 7.5(b), then the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to make an indemnification payment
to the Tax Indemnified Party until there is a determination by the Arbiter or
a Final Determination regarding the Tax Claim, as the case may be. In all
other cases, the Tax Indemnifying Party will pay the Tax Indemnified Party the
amount set forth in the Tax Notice, in cash or other immediately available
funds, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Tax Notice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the amount for which the Tax Indemnified Party reasonably
believes it is entitled to be indemnified is not known at the time of the Tax
Notice, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount known to be due and
the Tax Indemnified Party will deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party a further
Tax Notice specifying the unknown amount as soon as reasonably practicable
after such amount is known and payment will then be made as set forth above.

(e) The Tax Indemnifying Party may object to the Tax Claim (or the amount
thereof) set forth in any Tax Notice by giving the Tax Indemnified Party,
within thirty (30) days following receipt of such Tax Notice, written notice
setting forth the Tax Indemnifying Partys grounds for so objecting (the "
_Tax Objection Notice_ "). If the Tax Indemnifying Party does not

 



157  give the Tax Indemnified Party the Tax Objection Notice within such thirty
(30) day period, the Tax Indemnified Party may exercise any and all of its
rights under applicable Law and this Agreement to collect such amount.

(f) If the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Indemnifying Party are unable to
settle any dispute regarding a Tax Claim within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Tax Objection Notice, the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax
Indemnifying Party will, in accordance with Section 7.10, jointly request the
Arbiter to resolve the dispute as promptly as possible.

(g) Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees not to
bring any actions or proceedings, at law, in equity or otherwise, against any
other Party or its Affiliates, in respect of any breaches or alleged breaches
of any representation, warranty or other provision of this Article VII, except
pursuant to and subject to the express provisions of this Section 7.6.

Section 7.7 Refunds.

 

(a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in trust for the
benefit of Seller all refunds (including interest paid thereon by a
Governmental Authority and any amounts applied against a Tax Liability for
other taxable periods, net of any Tax cost arising as a result thereof
(including Tax on such interest or refund or other additional Tax payable as a
result of such refund) and any cost incurred in preparing any claim for
refund to the extent attributable to any refund payable to Seller) of any
Taxes for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement (" _Seller s Refunds_"), and, within five (5) Business Days after
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any such Sellers Refund,
Purchaser or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall pay over to Seller the amount
of such Sellers Refund without right of set off or counterclaim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers Refunds
shall include any Transfer Tax, VAT or any other transfer or similar Tax that
is the obligation of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement that is actually
recovered by Purchaser or its Affiliates by way of a refund, credit, or
otherwise, in each case, net of any Tax cost arising as a result thereof
(including Tax on such interest or refund, credit or recovery or other
additional Tax payable as a result of such refund, credit or recovery) and any
cost incurred to obtain such refund, credit or recovery.

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in trust for the
benefit of Purchaser and its Affiliates all refunds (including interest paid
thereon by a Governmental Authority and any amounts applied against a Tax
Liability for other taxable periods, net of any Tax cost arising as a result
thereof (including Tax on such interest or refund or other additional Tax
payable as a result of such refund) and any cost incurred in preparing any
claim for refund to the extent attributable to any refund payable to
Purchaser) of any Taxes for which Seller is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement (" _Purchaser s Refunds_") and, within five (5)
Business Days of receipt by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any such
Purchasers Refund, Seller or and its Affiliate, as applicable, shall pay over
to Purchaser the amount of Purchasers Refund without right of set off or
counterclaim.

(c) Upon the reasonable request of Seller, Purchaser will file, or cause a
Conveyed Company or other Affiliate of the Purchaser to file, claims for
Sellers Refunds, in

 



158  such form as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the filing of any such claim will not result in any prejudice to Purchaser or
its Affiliates. Seller will have the sole right to prosecute any claims for
Sellers Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Sellers expense and with counsel
of Sellers choice. Purchaser will cooperate, and cause the appropriate
Conveyed Company or other Affiliate of the Purchaser to cooperate, fully, at
Sellers expense, with Seller and its counsel in connection therewith.

(d) Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, Seller shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to file, claims for Purchasers Refunds, in such form as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of
any such claim will not result in any prejudice to Seller or its Affiliates.
Purchaser will have the sole right to prosecute any claims for Purchasers
Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Purchasers expense and with counsel of
Purchasers choice. Seller will cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate, fully, at Purchasers expense, with Purchaser and its counsel in
connection therewith.

(e) Except as provided in Sections 7.7(a) and 7.7(b) hereof, any refunds of
Taxes other than Sellers Refunds and Purchasers Refunds will be the property
of the payee of such refunds and no other Party nor any of its Affiliates will
have any right to such refunds.

(f) To the extent reasonably requested by Seller, and within (30) days of such
request, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall grant to Seller appropriate
powers of attorney as may reasonably be necessary to prosecute or defend its
rights under this Section 7.7.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
entitled to any Tax refunds to the extent such refunds were included in Final
Closing Working Capital.

Section 7.8 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, Seller and
Purchaser, in each case at no cost to the other Party, shall cooperate (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate) with each other and with
each others agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in
connection with Tax matters relating to the Conveyed Companies and the
Purchased Assets, including (a) the preparation and filing of Tax Returns, (b)
determining the Liability for and amount of any Taxes due or the right to and
amount of any refund of Taxes, (c) examinations of Tax Returns, and (d) any
administrative or judicial proceedings in respect of Taxes assessed or
proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation shall include making all information
and documents in their possession related to the foregoing available to the
other, as provided in Section 7.9 hereof. Seller and Purchaser also shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and available, personnel responsible for preparing,
maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes. Any
information or documents provided under this Section 7.8 or Section 7.9 shall
be kept confidential by the Party receiving the information or documents,
except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to Taxes.

 

Section 7.9 Tax Records. Tax records (" _Tax Records_ ") in possession of
Seller and/or its Affiliates relating to the Conveyed Companies (other than
those included in the Excluded Assets) shall be transferred to Purchaser.
Seller may make and retain copies of such

 



159  Tax Records at its sole cost. Seller, Purchaser, and their respective
Affiliates shall make available to each other (at no cost to the requesting
Party) for inspection and copying during normal business hours upon
reasonable notice all Tax Records in their possession relating to the Conveyed
Companies and the Purchased Assets to the extent reasonably required by the
other Party in connection with Tax planning or the preparation of
Tax Returns, the resolution of items under this Article VII, Contests or
other audits, disputes or litigation related to Taxes. Seller, Purchaser, and
their respective Affiliates shall preserve and keep such Tax Records in their
possession until the expiration of any applicable Tax statutes of limitation
and as otherwise required by Law, but in any event for a period of not less
than ten (10) years after the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.10 Dispute Resolution. If Seller and Purchaser fail to agree on the
resolution of any of the matters in this Article VII, clause (iv) of the
first sentence of Section 8.5 or Section 2.10 that require the agreement of
the Parties or otherwise disagree about the proper interpretation or operation
of any provision of this Article VII, clause (iv) of the first sentence of
Section 8.5, Section 5.9 or Section 2.10, then such matter shall be referred
to the Arbiter for binding arbitration. Seller and Purchaser shall deliver to
the Arbiter copies of any schedules or documentation that may reasonably be
required by the Arbiter to make its determination. Each of Purchaser and
Seller shall be entitled to submit to the Arbiter a memorandum setting forth
its position with respect to such arbitration. The Arbiter shall render a
determination within sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter for
binding arbitration. Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay to the
other Party the amount determined by the Arbiter within ten (10) days of the
date on which the Arbiter makes its determination. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 7.10, the Arbiter may, at its sole discretion, amend
the procedures contained herein. The determination of the Arbiter shall be
final and binding on all Parties. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Arbiters fees and expenses incurred with respect to any
matters in this Article VII, clause (iv) of the first sentence of Section
8.5, Section 5.9 or Section 2.10 shall be shared equally, fifty percent (50%)
by the Seller and fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser.

 

Section 7.11 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. As of the Closing Date,
(a) all Tax Sharing Agreements existing between any of the Seller and/or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Conveyed Companies, on the other
hand, shall be terminated; and (b) amounts due under such Tax Sharing
Agreements shall be settled prior to the Closing Date. Upon such termination
and settlement, no further payments by or to the Conveyed Companies with
respect to such Tax Sharing Agreements shall be made, all other rights and
obligations resulting from such Tax Sharing Agreements between the Conveyed
Companies and others shall cease at such time and no right or liability will
be included as an asset or a liability in the calculation of the Final Closing
Working Capital with respect to such Tax Sharing Agreements or the termination
or settlement thereof.

 

Section 7.12 Adjustment. The Parties agree that any indemnification payment
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Final Aggregate Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

Section 7.13 Transfer Taxes. Subject to Section 5.10 or as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, all Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Purchaser

 



160  and fifty percent (50%) by Seller; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Transfer Taxes that are actually recovered by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates are subject to Section 7.7 of this Agreement and the Purchaser
shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any recovery or refund with respect to
any such Taxes and to cooperate with the Seller in providing any information
or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to obtain such recovery or
refund. For the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable efforts shall not include
any change to the operations of Purchaser or its Affiliates or require
Purchaser or its Affiliates to implement any further Tax planning techniques
to obtain any such recovery or refund.

(a) Subject to Purchaser providing Seller with a list of
Purchasers Affiliates that Purchaser has designated pursuant to Section 2.1
to purchase Purchased Assets or Equity Interests at least sixty (60) calendar
days prior to the Closing Date Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at least
twenty-five (25) calendar days before the Closing Date a schedule of expected
Transfer Taxes with respect to the Closing (which schedule shall include the
VAT treatment pursuant to applicable Law of each asset type to be sold (or,
where different, of each supply to be made for VAT purposes in connection
with the Closing) by Seller, or any Equity Selling Entity or Asset Selling
Entity, as reasonably determined by Seller, and reasonably detailed
information to support Sellers view of such VAT treatment). Seller shall
cooperate, as reasonably requested by Purchaser, to minimize the amount of
Transfer Taxes payable, including by claiming any available exemption or any
available refund, credit or other recovery, and by executing and filing any
invoices, forms or certificates reasonably required. The parties shall provide
each other with any information reasonably requested in order to comply with
applicable Transfer Tax Laws, where such information is connected with the
Transfer Tax treatment or position in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The amount of any refund, credit or other
recovery received or utilized by Seller of any Transfer Taxes borne by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.13 shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation required to be filed by each party with
respect to all Transfer Taxes, consistently with the amount of Transfer Taxes
as determined pursuant to this Section 7.13, and, if required by applicable
Law, the parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(c) As between Purchaser and Seller, the determination of the amount of any
Transfer Taxes (including whether any exemption from (or reduction in)
Transfer Taxes is available) required to be paid with respect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be made
by Seller in good faith in its reasonable discretion; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Purchaser reasonably disagrees with Sellers determination with
respect to any Transfer Tax and obtains prior to the applicable due date of
the Transfer Tax a reliance opinion (for the avoidance of doubt, addressed to
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, and not to Seller, but a copy of which
is provided to Seller) that Purchasers position is "more likely than not"
to prevail, Purchasers position shall control. The cost of the "more likely
than not" opinion is to be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty
percent (50%) by Seller.

 



161 (d) VAT.

 

(i) If the sale of any Purchased Asset under this Agreement is subject to VAT,
Purchaser shall pay such VAT to Seller or the relevant Equity Selling Entity
or Asset Selling Entity. Purchaser will pay such VAT to Seller not later than
thirty (30) calendar days after Purchasers receipt of a valid VAT invoice
issued by Seller or the relevant Equity Selling Entity or Asset Selling
Entity that complies with the relevant conditions under applicable Law and
that is addressed to Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate of Purchaser (as
appropriate). Seller shall deliver a copy of draft VAT invoices to Purchaser
for Purchasers review and input of any necessary information about the
applicable Purchaser Affiliate. Seller shall provide such draft invoice within
a reasonable period of time prior to the due date for Seller (or the relevant
Equity Selling Entity or Asset Selling Entity) to issue such invoice (taking
into account any applicable extensions), and Seller shall reflect on such VAT
invoices the required information provided by Purchaser and any reasonable
comments submitted by Purchaser. Subject to Purchaser providing Seller the
required information within a reasonable time prior to such due date (taking
into account any applicable extensions) for filing such invoice and remitting
any VAT, any interest or penalties incurred by Seller, Purchaser, or their
respective Affiliates as a result of an invalid VAT invoice issued by Seller
or one of its Affiliates shall be borne by Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall
use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to determine the
appropriate rate of VAT and to exempt the transfer of the Purchased Assets
from any VAT to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(ii) Should any Taxing Authority provide notification that VAT was applied in
error, then (A) Seller shall without unreasonable delay provide Purchaser
with a valid credit note; and (B) if the VAT applied in error was paid by
Purchaser, Seller shall without unreasonable delay repay to Purchaser any such
VAT under the condition that Purchaser cooperates in ensuring, where
reasonably possible, that Seller will be able to correct this error with its
competent tax office and obtain a VAT credit from the tax office for the VAT
that was charged in error.

 

(iii) At the Closing where the Purchased Assets include an interest in real
property and the transfer of such Purchased Assets is, or is treated as
being, not liable to VAT, Purchaser and Seller will cooperate to the extent
permitted by Law, to ensure that the transfer of such real property interest
qualifies for such treatment.

 

Section 7.14 Section 338(h)(10) Election and Section 338(g) Elections. Seller
shall join with Purchaser in timely making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or
foreign Tax Law) (collectively a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with
respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of the Conveyed Entities listed
on _Schedule 7.14_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (such entities, the "
_Section 338 Entities_ "), and Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in the
completion and timely filing of such elections in accordance with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or any successor provision.
Purchaser and Seller shall determine the fair market value of the assets of
such Section 338 Entities and the allocation of Final Aggregate Purchase Price
(as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder), together with applicable liabilities,
among such assets and shall agree on a schedule setting forth the allocation
as soon as

 



162  practicable after the Closing Date. Purchaser and Seller agree to report the
transfers under this Agreement consistent with Section 338(h)(10) Election and
shall take no position on any Tax Return or with any Taxing Authority
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law. Seller
acknowledges that Purchaser intends to make an election under Section 338(g)
of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign
Tax Law) with respect to each Conveyed Company incorporated in a foreign
jurisdiction (the " _Section 338(g) Elections_ ") and Seller will reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to the extent Purchaser decides to make any such
Section 338(g) Election. This Section 7.14 shall be subject to Section 2.10.

Section 7.15 Chinese Legal Requirements. Seller and its Affiliates shall
comply with all applicable Chinese legal requirements for Tax filing and
payment purposes, including, but not limited to, requirements with respect to
Chinese enterprise income Taxes, PRC Tax Circular 698 and related notices.

Section 8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

 

(a) The respective representations and warranties (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.10,
Fundamental Representations and those in Section 3.16 with respect to Taxes)
of Seller and Purchaser contained in Articles III and IV (and the ability to
bring claims for breaches thereof) shall survive the date hereof until the
date that is fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date, the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.10 (and the ability to bring claims for

representation and warranty, in which case such claim and such representation
and warranty (and Sellers or Purchasers potential liability therefor)
shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved and

of the Parties to seek indemnification for any breach of any covenant or
agreement occurring prior to its applicable survival date.

") and save and hold each of them harmless against any Losses incurred,
sustained or suffered by them arising out of or as a result of: (i) any

addressed by Article VII exclusively) to be true and correct on the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date; (ii) any breach of any covenant or

in this Article VIII, after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to defend and
indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers and
directors (" _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and save and hold each of them harmless
against any Losses incurred, sustained or suffered by them arising out of or
as a result of: (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by

and as of the Closing Date; (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by

Section 8.4 Limitation on Indemnification, Mitigation.

 

(a) _Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement:

 

(i) Except with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental
Representations, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be liable for any claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(i), Section 8.2(iii) or Section
8.3(i), as applicable (A) for any individual item (or series of related items)
where the Loss relating thereto is less than $200,000 (the " _Per-Claim
Deductible_ "), and (B) in respect of each individual item (or series of
related items) where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than the
Per-Claim Deductible, unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, equals or exceeds $30.0 million (the " _General Basket_ "), in
which case Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall be liable only for
the amount of such Losses in excess of such amount.

 



164 (ii) Except with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of
Fundamental Representations, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(i),
Section 8.2(iii) or Section 8.3(i), as the case may be, shall be an amount
equal to $300.0 million (the " _Cap_ ").

(iii) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered by (i) Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.6, Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.2(ii) or (ii) Seller Indemnitees for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be an amount equal to the Purchase
Price. 

(iv) Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach which gives rise to the Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
Purchaser shall not be required to, or cause any Subsidiary to, commence or
maintain any Action to mitigate or offset any Losses except as expressly set
forth in Section 8.5 and (ii) in no event shall any provision of
this Agreement require Purchaser to, or cause any Subsidiary to, seek
indemnification against (a) any material customer of any Purchaser Indemnitee
(including the Conveyed Companies) unless the amount of otherwise
indemnifiable Losses reasonably likely to be recovered from such customer
exceeds $10,000,000 or (b) any material supplier or other material business
partner of any Purchaser Indemnitee (including the Conveyed Companies) unless
the amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses reasonably likely to be
recovered from such supplier or business partner exceeds $1,000,000. Further,
the failure to mitigate if required hereby shall not result in the loss of any
indemnification rights but the amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses
resulting from such matter will be reduced by the amount thereof that would
have been prevented had such mitigation occurred.

 

(v) With respect to each representation or warranty that is Qualified, no such
Qualification (other than the Specified Qualifications) shall be taken into
account for the purpose of determining whether an inaccuracy or breach of such
representation or warranty has occurred or the amount of any Loss that is the
subject of indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) _Mitigation by Seller_. Seller shall take and shall cause its Affiliates
to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to
remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss; _provided_ ,  _however_ , (i)
Seller shall not be required to, or cause any Affiliate to, commence or
maintain any Action to mitigate or offset any Losses except as expressly set
forth in Section 8.5 and (ii) in no event shall any provision of this
Agreement require Seller to, or cause any Affiliate to, seek indemnification
against (a) any material customer of any Seller Indemnitee unless the amount
of otherwise indemnifiable Losses reasonably likely to be recovered from
such customer exceeds $10,000,000 or (b) any material supplier or other
material business partner of any Seller Indemnitee unless the amount of
otherwise indemnifiable Losses reasonably likely to be recovered from such
supplier or business partner exceeds $1,000,000. Further, the failure to
mitigate if required hereby shall not result in the loss of any
indemnification rights but the amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses
resulting from such matter will be reduced by the amount thereof that would
have been prevented had such mitigation occurred.

 



165 Section 8.5 Losses Net of Insurance, Etc. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under Section 7.6, Section 8.2 or Section
8.3 shall be net of (i) any accruals or reserves included in the Final Closing
Working Capital with respect to such matter, (ii) any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party, (iii) any insurance
proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement actually received
as an offset against such Loss (in the cases of clauses (ii) or (iii), net of
reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such recovery and, with respect to
recoveries from insurance, any increase in premiums or retroactive premium
adjustments or chargebacks paid by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party as
a result of the insurance claim related to such Loss, and any loss or
reduction in coverage under the relevant insurance policy as a result of the
insurance claim related to such Loss) (each source of recovery named in
clauses (ii) and (iii), a " _Collateral Source_ ") and (iv) an amount equal to
the cash Tax benefit, if any, attributable to such Loss that is actually
recognized (determined on a "with and without" basis and net of any of
reasonable costs of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates attributable to
or incurred to recover such Tax benefit) by the Indemnified Party in the
taxable year any indemnity payment is paid to an Indemnified Party under this
Agreement or in any of the three (3) subsequent taxable years or the three (3)
prior taxable years ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any prior taxable year, any Tax benefit that is, in the case of
a Purchaser Indemnitee, attributable to a taxable period or portion thereof
of a Conveyed Company that ends on or prior to the Closing Date and is
actually recognized by the Seller or its Affiliates (determined on a with and
without basis), including any such Tax benefit actually recognized by the
Seller or its Affiliates that is attributable to a Sellers Refund paid by
Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, shall not be deemed a
Tax benefit actually recognized by such Purchaser Indemnitee for purposes of
this Section 8.5(iv)). Nothing in this Agreement shall (a) require any
Indemnified Party to continue or maintain in effect any insurance policies,
(b) claim or utilize any deduction, loss or other Tax benefit unless the
Indemnifying Party delivers, from a mutually agreeable independent accounting
firm, an opinion that such position is "more likely than not" to prevail under
applicable Tax Law (with the cost of the "more likely than not" opinion borne
fifty percent (50%) by the Indemnifying Party and fifty percent (50%) by the
Indemnified Party) or (c) prevent or delay any Person from obtaining any
indemnification hereunder prior to recovery of any amounts from any
Collateral Source or receiving any Tax benefit or using any efforts to obtain
any such recovery or benefit; however, if the amount to be netted hereunder in
connection with a Collateral Source from any payment required under Section
7.6, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 is determined after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Article VIII had such determination been made at the time of such payment, and
any excess recovery from a Collateral Source with respect to a given matter
shall be applied to reduce any future payments to be made by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to Section 7.6, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 with respect to such
matter. The Indemnifying Parties waive all rights of subrogation with respect
to any indemnification payments made by them and shall not be entitled to any
rights of subrogation with respect to claims indemnified by them.

 



166 Section 8.6 Indemnification Procedure.

 

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Article VIII (an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
including any claim by a third party described in Section 8.7, which might
give rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
a certificate (the " _Claim Certificate_ "), which Claim Certificate shall:

 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or anticipates it will incur
liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

(ii) to the extent then known, specify in reasonable detail (and have annexed
thereto material supporting documentation, including any material, third party
correspondence in connection with any Third-Party Claim and paid invoices for
claimed Losses, as applicable) each Loss included in the amount so stated,
the date such item was paid or accrued, as applicable, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and
the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder;

_provided_ , _that_ , the failure to provide any such Claim Certificate,
information or documents will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
the defense of such action is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or
claims specified in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall,
within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such
Claim Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice of objection to
such effect, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection,
and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty
(60) day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of
such objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims to which the
Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective
rights with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth
such agreement. Should the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be
unable to agree as to any particular item or items or amount or amounts
within such time period, then the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to
submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in
Section 10.11(b).

 

(c) Claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of agreement of the nature
described in Section 8.6(b) and claims for Losses the validity and amount of
which have been the subject of judicial determination as described in Section
8.6(b) or shall have been settled with the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
as described in Section 8.7 are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "
_Agreed Claims_." Within ten (10) Business Days of the determination of the
amount of any of the Agreed Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party 

 



167  an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified
Party in a notice to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business
Days prior to such payment.

Section 8.7 Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against any Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification
hereunder for any Loss under this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim, but the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent
that the defense of such action is actually and materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, any
such third-party claim, action, suit or proceeding (a " _Third-Party Claim_
"), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party
advance notice of any proposed compromise or settlement and in no event shall
the Indemnifying Party compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, unless such compromise or settlement (i) provides for
no relief other than the payment of monetary damages borne solely by the
Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not include any admission of wrongdoing or
violation of Law on the part of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and
(iii) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party
claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability in respect
thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall only be entitled to direct the defense (A) for so
long as the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense in an active and diligent
manner, (B) if the Third-Party Claim is not in respect of any matter involving
potential criminal liability and does not seek as a remedy the imposition of
an equitable remedy that, if granted, would be binding upon the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (C) if the Third-Party Claim is in respect of
an indemnification claim by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to Section
8.2(i) or Section 8.2(iii) or any Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.3(i)
and such Third-Party Claim is reasonably expected to result in Losses less
than 50% of which would be in excess of the Cap, (D) if the Indemnified Party
does not have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims which are
inconsistent with one or more defenses or counterclaims which may be alleged
by the Indemnifying Party and (E) with respect to any matter if
the Indemnified Party shall not have been advised by outside counsel that
there would be an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party with respect to such matter.

 

(b) No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim for
which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, it
shall nevertheless permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not
control, the defense of any such action or suit through counsel chosen by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (without limiting the Indemnified Partys ability to assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense
pursuant to the last sentence of (a)) the Indemnified Party shall 

 



168  have the right to employ counsel to represent it, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, if either (i) the Indemnified Party has available to it one
or more defenses or counterclaims which are inconsistent with one or more
defenses or counterclaims which may be alleged by the Indemnifying Party or
(ii) there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct
the defense or prosecution of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the defense or prosecution
of any Third-Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ counsel of its
own choosing for such purpose. An Indemnifying Party will lose any previously
acquired right to control the defense of any Proceeding if for any reason the
Indemnifying Party ceases (after notice and reasonably opportunity to cure) to
actively, competently and diligently conduct the defense or otherwise fails
to continue to have the right to control such defense as described in Section
8.7(a).

 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-
Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the
provision of the Indemnifying Party records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) the making available
of employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

Section 8.8 No Contribution by Conveyed Companies. From and after the Closing
Date, (a) the Conveyed Companies will not have any Liability to any Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee as a result of any misrepresentation or breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement and (b) no Seller Indemnitee will have any right of indemnification
or contribution against a Conveyed Company (whether under (i) this Agreement,
(ii) the organizational documents of the Conveyed Company, (iii) other
Contracts with any Conveyed Company, (iv) rights or remedies otherwise
granted under state corporation statutes, limited liability company statutes
or other applicable Laws or (v) otherwise) on account of an indemnity claim
pursuant to Section 8.2.

Section 8.9 Sole Remedy/Waiver. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the
event that the Closing occurs:

(a) the sole and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to
any and all Losses arising in connection with the representations, warranties
and covenants set forth in this Agreement will be pursuant to the

the Closing:

 

(a) by written agreement of Purchaser and Seller;

 

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to the date that is the one year anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the " _End Date_ ") (unless the failure to consummate the Closing
by such date shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing
shall have been satisfied or waived at such time (other than (A) the Antitrust
Conditions and (B) those other conditions that, by their nature, cannot be

to time by written notice to Seller prior to the then-current End Date and
Seller may extend the End Date from time to time by written notice to
Purchaser prior to the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the then-

after the date of this Agreement, the latest of any of which dates shall
thereafter be deemed to be the End Date;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
Seller shall be responsible for and pay directly, or reimburse Purchaser or
its Affiliates to the extent paid by the Purchaser or its Affiliates for, all
ticking fees or similar fees or costs (including in the form of interest on

Financing Commitments (or any debt issued in lieu thereof or pursuant to the
definitive documents contemplated thereby) arising in connection with, as a
result of or incurred during the period covered by any Extension effected by

other competent Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this

nonappealable (unless such Order or action shall be due to the failure of the
Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its
obligations under this Agreement);

(d) by written notice from Purchaser following a breach of any covenant
or agreement of Seller, the Seller Entities or the Conveyed Companies
contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the

and Section 6.2(b) is incapable of being satisfied at such time and such
breach or inaccuracy is not cured as of the earlier of (i) three (3) Business
Days prior to the End Date and (ii) thirty (30) days after written notice of
such breach from Purchaser is received by Seller; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be
available to Purchaser if it is then in material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

(e) by written notice from Seller following a breach of any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have

written notice of such breach from Seller is received by Purchaser; provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)
shall not be available to Seller, if Seller, any Seller Entity or any
Conveyed Company is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 

(f) by written notice from Seller, if all conditions in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but such conditions
must be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date valid
notice of termination of this Agreement is delivered by Seller to Purchaser)
and Purchaser shall have failed to complete the Closing as a result of the
full proceeds to be provided to Purchaser by the Debt Financing not being
available within two Business Days after the date on which the Closing should
have occurred pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Seller, the Seller Entities and
the Conveyed Companies stood ready and willing to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement during such period (which shall be evidenced by
a written notice delivered by Seller to Purchaser to that effect at least two
Business Days prior to the termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(f));

partners, managers, members, stockholders or other Representatives shall have
any Liability to the other Party or their 

 



171  respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, stockholders or other Representatives under or with respect to this
Agreement except (A) that this Section 9.2, Section 5.1 (" _Information and
Documents_ "), Section 5.17 (" _Confidentiality_ "), Section 10.1 (" _Notices_
"), Section 10.3 (" _Amendment; Waiver_ "), Section 10.4 (" _Assignment_ "),
Section 10.5 (" _Entire Agreement_ "), Section 10.6 (" _Parties in Interest_
"), Section 10.7 (" _Public Disclosure_ "), Section 10.8 (" _Return of
Information_ "), Section 10.9 (" _Expenses_ "), Section 10.11 (" _Governing
Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation of Liability_ "), Section
10.12 (" _Counterparts_ "), Section 10.13 (" _Headings_ "), Section 10.14 ("
_No Strict Construction_ "), Section 10.15 (" _Severability_ "), Section
10.16 (" _Release_ ") and Section 10.18 (" _No Recourse_ ") which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and (B) that (i) subject to Sections
1.1(b) and 1.1(c), the Liability of any Party for fraud or willful or
intentional breach by such Party of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement occurring prior to the
termination of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and (ii) in the event of any termination of this Agreement and a
related action for fraud or breach of contract (including in any action to
recover the Purchaser Fee by Seller), the prevailing Party shall be reimbursed
by the other Parties to the action for reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses relating to such action, but in no event shall any Party be liable
for punitive damages hereunder or with respect thereto.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(c) (but
for purposes of Section 9.1(c), only if such Order is attributable to an
Antitrust Law) and, in each case, at the time of such termination all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived
(other than (A) the Antitrust Conditions and (B) those other conditions that,
by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), or

 

(ii) by Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(e) or Section 9.1(f),

 

then Purchaser shall as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination, make a payment in cash
to Seller in an amount equal to $210,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Fee_ "). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event this Agreement is terminated
in the circumstances described in this Section 9.2(b), Purchaser shall not
be responsible for paying Seller or its Affiliates any amounts in excess of
an amount equal to the Purchaser Fee (and the expenses, if any, contemplated
by clause (B)(ii) of Section 9.2(a)).

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
Purchaser fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 2.11(a) for
any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement in any way (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) prior to the Closing
or fails to perform hereunder in any way (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) prior to the Closing, then, (i) Sellers, the
Seller Entities, the Conveyed Companies and their Affiliates sole and
exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Purchaser, its Affiliates and any of their respective
former, current or future directors, officers, employees,

limited partners, stockholders, incorporators, Affiliates, Financing Sources,
attorneys, representatives, agents, successors or assignees or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, direct or indirect
equityholder, controlling person, partner, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder, incorporator, Affiliate,
attorney, representative, agent, successor or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for any breach,
loss or damage shall be (A) the right to terminate this Agreement and receive
payment of the Purchaser Fee (and the expenses, if any, contemplated by
clause (B)(ii) of Section 9.2(a)) as and only to the extent provided by
Section 9.2(b), or (B) the right of Seller to seek to enforce the obligations
of Purchaser by a decree of specific performance and to seek temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of the obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement as and
only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 10.17(b) and (ii) except as
provided in the immediately foregoing clause (i), none of the Purchaser
Related Parties will have any Liability or other obligation (in each case
whether absolute, accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise) to the Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, or the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other agreement,
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, through
Purchaser or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Purchaser or against
any other Purchaser Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other applicable Law, or otherwise. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in no event will Purchaser be required to pay the Purchaser Fee on more
than one occasion. Upon termination of this Agreement by the Seller and the
receipt by Seller of the Purchaser Fee (and the expenses, if any, contemplated
by clause (B)(ii) of Section 9.2(a)), none of the Purchaser Related Parties
shall have any further Liability or other obligation to the Seller or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other Transaction
Document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Purchaser
Related Parties shall have any further Liability or other obligation to the
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event
shall Seller, the Seller Entities or the Conveyed Companies be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement prior to the Closing
other than solely under the specific circumstances set forth in Section
10.17(b). Without limiting the obligations of the Financing Sources under the
Financing Agreements, Seller acknowledges and agrees that no Financing Sources
shall have any liability or obligation to the Seller or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents if such Financing Source breaches or fails to perform
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of its
obligations under the Financing Agreements.

 

(d) Nothing in this Section 9.2 shall limit (i) prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the right of Seller to seek to
enforce the obligations of Purchaser by a decree of specific performance and
to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the obligations of
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement as and only to the extent expressly
permitted by Section 10.17(b), (ii) following the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the right of Seller to 

 



173  receive the Purchaser Fee to the extent expressly provided by Section 9.2(b)

or (iii) Sellers rights under the Confidentiality Agreement or the CT
Confidentiality Agreement.

permitted but where an amended joinder is legally permissible in relation to
the relevant Conveyed Company or Permitted Designee, with such amendments as
are necessary to render the joinder permitted by applicable Law in relation to
such Conveyed Company or Permitted Designee) pursuant to which they will
become a "Party" to this Agreement and assume, and will be obligated (a) with

Purchasers obligations under this Agreement and (b) each other, severally but
not jointly, to perform and satisfy their respective obligations under

only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Purchaser and Seller or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party
against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
amendment may be made to Sections 9.2(c), 10.3, 10.6, 10.11 and 10.18 that
adversely affects the rights of any Financing Source without prior written
consent of such Financing Source. No failure or delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. No waiver that may be given will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given and shall not be deemed a continuing
waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision.

 

Section 10.4 Assignment. No Party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign its
rights or obligations hereunder (a) to any Permitted Designee (including (i)
the right to acquire all or part of the Purchased Assets or Equity Interests
or (ii) assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, in
which event all references herein to Purchaser will be deemed to refer to such
Affiliates, as appropriate), or (b) for collateral security purposes to the
Financing Sources, and all extensions,

 



175  renewals, replacements, refinancings and refundings thereof (or an agent or
trustee therefor); _provided_ _that_ , no such assignment will in any event
limit or affect the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement. Any
obligation of any Party to any other Party under this Agreement, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party,
shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

Section 10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules and
Exhibits, the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and the Seller Disclosure Letter)
contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, with respect to such matters except for (a) the Confidentiality
Agreement and CT Confidentiality Agreement, each of which will remain in full
force and effect for the term provided for therein if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 and (b) any written agreement of
the Parties that expressly provides that it is not superseded by this
Agreement.

Section 10.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Seller or their successors or
permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement,
except that (a) the Conveyed Company Covered Persons shall be third-party
beneficiaries of the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.12, (b)
any Affiliates of Seller that have provided Parent Guarantees shall be third-
party beneficiaries of the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.13,

Financing Sources, who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof,
(d) Section 7.6 and Article VIII shall inure to the benefit of the Seller
Indemnitees and Purchaser Indemnitees and (e) Sections 9.2(c), 10.6 and 10.18
shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Related Parties, who are intended
to be third-party beneficiaries thereof.

 

Section 10.7 Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each Party agrees that, except as may be required to comply with
the requirements of any applicable Laws and the rules and regulations of each
stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party is listed, if any, no
press release or similar public announcement or communication shall be made
of or concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents unless the Parties shall have consulted in advance with
respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, (a) upon the
request of either Seller or Purchaser, upon the execution of this Agreement
and upon the Closing, the Seller and Purchaser shall release a joint press
release mutually acceptable to the Seller and Purchaser, (b) the parties may
make any press release or other public announcement (including to analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or analyst or investor
conference calls), to the extent that such release or announcement contains
information previously publicly disclosed in accordance with this Section
10.7 or is otherwise consistent in all material respects with previous
statements made jointly by the Purchaser and Seller and (c) Purchaser and its
Affiliates may make customary disclosures as expressly contemplated by the
Financing Commitments (including in connection with the syndication of the
Debt Financing). In the event any Party determines that a public disclosure of
or concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents is required to comply with the requirements of any
applicable Laws or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which
the securities

 



176  of such Party is listed, then, prior to making any such filing, such Party
shall provide the other and its counsel with a redacted version of this
Agreement (and any other Transaction Document) which it intends to file, and
will give due consideration to any comments provided by such other Party or
its counsel and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the confidential
treatment by such Governmental Authority of those sections specified by such
other Party or its counsel. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan and (b) to ensure that all
press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions hereof, Seller shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with Purchaser regarding the form and content
of any public disclosure of any material developments or matters involving
the Business (including the financial condition or results of operations),
Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Conveyed Companies, including
earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or release.

Section 10.8 Return of Information. If for any reason whatsoever
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, each
Party shall promptly return to the other Party all books and records furnished
by such other Party or any of its respective Affiliates, agents, employees, or
representatives (including all copies, summaries and abstracts, if any,
thereof) in accordance with the terms, but subject to the exceptions, of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 10.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such expenses; _provided_ _that_ any expenses of the Conveyed Companies
incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby) up to and
including the Closing shall be borne by Seller.

 

Section 10.10 Disclosure; Schedules. Seller shall give prompt written notice
to Purchaser of (a) any written notice received by Seller subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing of (or other written
communication relating to, or the occurrence of), any material default under
any Material Contract and (b) any written notice or other communication from
any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is required in
connection with the Transactions. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as may be amended or supplemented prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall expressly
not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller, or to otherwise imply,
that any such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement. Further,
no disclosure hereunder or supplement to the Seller Disclosure Letter from
and after the execution of this Agreement will be deemed to have cured any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for any
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification
provided for in Section 7.6 and Article VIII or for purposes of determining
whether the conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied.

 



177 Section 10.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation
of Liability.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles of such state.

(b) With respect to any Action related to or arising out of this Agreement or
the negotiation or performance hereof, each Party irrevocably (i) agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware State court and
(ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
venue of any Action brought in any such court, waives any claim that such
Action has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right
to object, with respect to such Action, that such court does not have any
jurisdiction over such Party. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not
constitute general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware for
any purpose except as provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the respective Parties to this Agreement. Each of
Seller and Purchaser irrevocably agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by United States registered mail to such Partys address
set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters for which it has submitted
to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 10.11(b). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not bring or support any action or proceeding described in this Section
10.11 other than in the courts as described above.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO
OR THERETO. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CONSENTS TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY OF ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING, (II) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (III) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.11(c).

(d) The Parties agree that the prevailing party or parties, as the case may
be, in any Action shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs of
litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees, from the non-prevailing
party. For purposes of this Section 10.11(d), each of the "prevailing party"
and the "non-prevailing party" in any Action shall be the party designated as
such by the court or other appropriate official presiding over such Action,
such determination to be made as a part of the judgment rendered thereby. 

 



178 (e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN
NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL (OTHER THAN ARISING BY REASON OF OR RESULTING FROM EFFORTS TO
MITIGATE LOSSES), INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF
SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE NONPERFORMING
PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT; _PROVIDED_ ,
_HOWEVER_ , THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT A
PERSONS ABILITY TO RECOVER ANY LOSSES IN RESPECT OF CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE AND OTHER SPECIAL DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT PAID IN
CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM.

 

Section 10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and delivered via facsimile, pdf, or other electronic means,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute

description whatsoever, in law or in equity, which such Seller Releasor or
its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns ever had, now has or
may in the future have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever related to the Business, the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities
or Conveyed Companies prior to the Closing Date (other than any Assumed

180 Section 10.17 Specific Performance.

 

(a) Subject to Section 10.17(b), each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by a Party, including such Partys failure to
take all actions as are necessary on such Partys part in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, subject to Section 10.17(b), in addition
to any other right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity, each Party shall be entitled to enforce any
provision of this Agreement (including Purchasers obligation to enforce its
rights under the Financing Commitments) by a decree of specific performance
and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
without posting any bond or other undertaking.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 10.17(a), it is explicitly agreed that, prior to
the Closing, unless this Agreement has been terminated, Seller shall be
entitled to seek specific performance of Purchasers obligation to cause the
Closing to occur (without limiting the right of the Seller to injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other
than with respect to the consummation of the Closing) only in the event that
(i) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 were satisfied (or, with
respect to conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken
or certificates delivered at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied) at
the time when the Closing would have been required to have occurred pursuant
to Section 2.11(a), (ii) the Debt Financing (including any Alternative
Financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the
conditions of, Section 5.19) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing
and (iii) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Seller would take such
actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing pursuant to
Article II to occur.

 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief, on the terms and
subject to the conditions and limitations set forth herein, on the basis that
the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Order.

 

Section 10.18 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement (including claims or causes of action in tort or other non-
contractual based theory) may only be brought against the entities that are
expressly named as parties hereto or which expressly become a party
hereto pursuant to Section 10.2 and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent
a named party to this Agreement hereto (or who becomes a party hereto pursuant
to Section 10.2), no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any party hereto shall have any Liability for any
obligations or Liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the Purchaser Related Parties is a third party
beneficiary of this Section 10.18.

 



181 Section 10.19 Holdings Guarantee. Holdings unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Seller the full and timely performance by the Purchaser of the
Purchasers obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not of
collection, and Holdings acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full
and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of Holdings obligations
or liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise,
shall affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee, as
well as any provision requiring or contemplating performance by Holdings.
Holdings hereby waives, for the benefit of Seller, (i) any right to require
Seller, as a condition of payment or performance by Holdings, to proceed
against Purchaser or pursue any other remedy whatsoever and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by applicable Law which limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense
is available to Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 10.19, the Seller hereby agrees that Holdings shall have
all defenses to its obligations hereunder that would be available to
Purchaser under this Agreement.
