AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 20, 2010,
among Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware corporation
("Valeant"), Biovail Corporation, a Canadian corporation ("Biovail"), Biovail
Americas Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Biovail ("BAC"), and Beach Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary of BAC ("Merger Sub").

  

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Valeant, the Board of Directors of Biovail,
the Board of Directors of BAC and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement, determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Valeant, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, are in the best interests of Valeant, Biovail or Merger Sub, as
applicable, and their respective stockholders and declared the advisability of
this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Valeant and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub has recommended adoption or approval, as applicable, of this Agreement by
their respective stockholders, as applicable;

  

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Biovail has recommended the approval by its
stockholders of the issuance of common shares of Biovail contemplated by this
Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS Valeant intends to declare and pay the Pre-Merger Special Dividend one
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, payable to holders of
record of Valeant Common Stock as of the close of business one Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date;

  

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Valeant and the Board of Directors of
Biovail have determined that the declaration and payment of the Post-Merger
Special Dividend will be in the best interests of the Combined Company and its
stockholders;

  

  

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended (i) to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (ii) to not result in gain being recognized under Section 367(a)(1) of the
Code (other than for any stockholder that would be a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" (within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Biovail following the Merger that does not enter into
a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in United States
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8(c)) (the "Intended Tax Treatment"), and this
Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

WHEREAS Valeant, Biovail, BAC and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Valeant (the "Merger"). At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Valeant shall
continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company").

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on
a date to be specified by Valeant and Biovail, which shall be no later than
the second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Valeant and
Biovail; provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article
VII shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived
on such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first
Business Day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waived or at such other time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between Valeant and Biovail. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed and acknowledged in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings
required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
specified in the Certificate of Merger, which shall be on the Business Day
following the date that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Valeant
and Biovail shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except
that the name of the Surviving Company shall be amended to be consistent with
the terms of Section 6.15. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name
of the Surviving Company.

  

  

SECTION 1.06. Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. The directors of
the Surviving Company shall be composed of the individuals identified on Annex
1.06 attached hereto (as it may be amended or modified from time to time after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written consent
of Biovail and Valeant) and shall continue until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Valeant immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Valeant, Biovail, BAC, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of Valeant Common Stock or Merger Sub Common
Stock:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, in Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Company ("Surviving Company Common Stock") with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted (the "Converted
Shares"). In addition to the foregoing conversion, the Surviving Company shall
issue 10,000,000 shares of Surviving Company Common Stock (the "Issued
Shares") to BAC contemporaneously with the Closing in consideration for the
deposit of the Merger Consideration by or on behalf of BAC with the Exchange
Agent. The Converted Shares and the Issued Shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after
the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the Converted Shares and
the Issued Shares until the Board of the Surviving Company issues new
certificates in respect of such shares.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Biovail-Owned Stock. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01, of Valeant (the "Valeant Common Stock") that is
owned by Valeant as treasury stock and each share of Valeant Common Stock, if
any, that is owned by Biovail, BAC or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Valeant Common Stock. Each share of Valeant Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and except as
provided in Section 2.01(d) with respect to the Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive that number of fully paid and
nonassessable common shares in the capital of Biovail (the "Biovail Common
Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). All such
shares of Valeant Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Valeant
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the
Pre-Merger Special Dividend (to the extent not previously paid) and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Biovail Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Exchange Ratio" means 1.7809. The Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the
nearest one-ten-thousandth of a share of Biovail Common Stock. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Biovail Common Stock or Valeant Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based
upon the number of shares of Biovail Common Stock or Valeant Common Stock, as
the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Biovail and the
holders of Valeant Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event. As provided in Section 2.02(i), the right
of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding
under applicable Tax Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Valeant Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262. At the Effective Time, all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal
Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01. Valeant
shall give prompt notice to Biovail of any demands received by Valeant for
appraisal of any shares of Valeant Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by Valeant.
Biovail shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Valeant
shall not, without the prior written consent of Biovail (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Biovail and Valeant shall agree upon and appoint a bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Biovail shall
deposit on behalf of BAC, or shall cause BAC to deposit, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Biovail Common Stock to be issued as Merger
Consideration and cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e). All such Biovail Common Stock and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund". As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
not later than the second Business Day thereafter, Biovail shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Valeant Common Stock a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as
Biovail may specify, subject to Valeant's approval), together with
instructions thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in the
case of shares of Valeant Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
in the case of shares of Valeant Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together
with the letter of transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Valeant Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.01 and (y) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(c). In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Valeant Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
Valeant, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Biovail
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and in
respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Valeant Common Stock (or, if such Valeant Common
Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02(b), each share of Valeant Common Stock and any Certificate with
respect thereto shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holders of such shares were entitled to receive in
respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and in respect of any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c)). No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or
shares of Valeant Common Stock held in book-entry form).

  

  

(c) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Biovail Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Valeant Common Stock held in book-entry form) with
respect to the shares of Biovail Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the surrender of such Certificate
(or shares of Valeant Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Valeant Common Stock held in
book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Biovail Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Biovail Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Biovail Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Biovail Common Stock.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Valeant Common Stock. The shares of Biovail
Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Article
II upon conversion of any shares of Valeant Common Stock (including any cash
paid pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Valeant Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company
of shares of Valeant Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly
representing shares of Valeant Common Stock (or shares of Valeant Common Stock
held in book-entry form) are presented to Biovail or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

  

  

(e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Biovail Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Valeant
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Biovail Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Valeant Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Biovail Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Valeant Common
Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the
average of the volume weighted average price per share of Biovail Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if
not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Biovail and Valeant) on each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending with
the second complete trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time,
weighted by the total volume of trading in Biovail Common Stock on each such
trading day. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests
pursuant to this Section 2.02(e) is not a separately bargained-for
consideration.

  

  

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Valeant Common Stock for 360 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holder of Valeant
Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Biovail for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(g) No Liability. None of Valeant, Biovail, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund
would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental
Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as mutually directed by Biovail and Valeant. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Company.

  

  

(i) Withholding Rights. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Valeant
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Valeant Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Biovail,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Biovail may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

SECTION 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Biovail and each of
Biovail's Subsidiaries (the "Biovail Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction
recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Biovail Subsidiaries,
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Biovail Material Adverse Effect. Each of Biovail and the
Biovail Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and possesses all
governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, variances,
exemptions, orders, registrations, clearances and approvals (collectively,
"Permits") necessary to enable it to own, operate, lease or otherwise hold its

(the "Biovail Permits"), except where the failure to have such power or
authority or to possess Biovail Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Biovail Material

business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to

Biovail Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, claims, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests), except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Section 3.02(a) of the
Biovail Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true

sentence. Except for the Biovail Convertible Notes, there are no debentures,
bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of Biovail having the right to vote (or

Neither Biovail nor any of the Biovail Subsidiaries is a party to any voting
agreement with respect to the voting of any capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests in, Biovail. Except for this Agreement, neither

SECTION 3.06. Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Biovail has
furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be furnished or filed by Biovail with the SEC and the Canadian
Securities Authorities since January 1, 2008 (such documents, together with
any documents filed with the SEC during such period by Biovail on a voluntary
basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, but excluding the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the "Biovail Reporting
Documents"). Biovail is a reporting issuer in each of the provinces of Canada
within the meaning of the Canadian Securities Laws. Biovail is in compliance
with all its material obligations under the Canadian Securities Laws and the
rules and policies of the TSX to which it is subject.

  

  

(b) Each Biovail Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
("SOX"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the Canadian Securities Laws,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC or the Canadian
Securities Authorities or promulgated thereunder applicable to such Biovail
Reporting Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Biovail included in the Biovail Reporting
Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Biovail and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

  

  

(c) Neither Biovail nor any Biovail Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Biovail Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Biovail and the chief financial
officer of Biovail (or each former chief executive officer of Biovail and each
former chief financial officer of Biovail, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Biovail Reporting
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and "chief
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. None of
Biovail or any of the Biovail Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged
any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers
within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Biovail maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Biovail's properties or assets.

  

  

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Biovail are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Biovail in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Biovail, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Biovail to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

  

(g) Neither Biovail nor any of the Biovail Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Biovail and any
of the Biovail Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Biovail or any of the Biovail Subsidiaries in Biovail's or
such Biovail Subsidiary's published financial statements or other Biovail
Reporting Documents.

  

  

(h) Since January 1, 2009, none of Biovail, Biovail's independent accountants,
the Biovail Board or the audit committee of the Biovail Board has received any
oral or written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Biovail, (y) "material weakness"
in the internal controls over financial reporting of Biovail or (z) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of
Biovail who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Biovail. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) None of the Biovail Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2009 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act or a reporting issuer in any of the provinces of Canada
within the meaning of the Canadian Securities Laws.

  

  

SECTION 3.07. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Biovail or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at
any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is declared effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to each of Biovail's stockholders and
Valeant's stockholders or at the time of each of the Biovail Stockholders
Meeting and the Valeant Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no
representation is made by Biovail or Merger Sub with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Valeant for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
the requirements of the CBCA and applicable Canadian Securities Laws, except
that no representation is made by Biovail with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Valeant for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  

  

SECTION 3.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From January 1, 2010 to

Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the
case of the Merger, to the receipt of the Valeant Stockholder Approval. The

on the part of Valeant are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve this

any provision of, any Contract to which Valeant or any Valeant Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or any
Valeant Permit or (iii) conflict with, or result in any violation of any
provision of, subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section

Valeant Stockholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Valeant Material
Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.05(a),
effects resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in
clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not
be excluded in determining whether a Valeant Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

qualified to do business, (iv) such filings with and approvals of the NYSE and
TSX as are required to permit the consummation of the Merger and (v) such
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Valeant Material Adverse Effect (it being
agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.05(b), effects resulting from or
arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the
definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in

SECTION 4.06. Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Valeant has
furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be furnished or filed by Valeant with the SEC since January 1,
2008 (such documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC during
such period by Valeant on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K,
but excluding the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, being collectively
referred to as the "Valeant Reporting Documents").

  

  

(b) Each Valeant Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Valeant Reporting Document and (ii)
did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing
or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of Valeant
included in the Valeant Reporting Documents complied at the time it was filed
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Valeant and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

  

  

(c) Neither Valeant nor any Valeant Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Valeant Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Valeant and the chief financial
officer of Valeant (or each former chief executive officer of Valeant and each
former chief financial officer of Valeant, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Valeant Reporting
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate. None of Valeant or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries has outstanding,
or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or
executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  

  

(e) Valeant maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Valeant's properties or assets.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Valeant are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Valeant in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Valeant, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Valeant to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

  

(g) Neither Valeant nor any of the Valeant Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Valeant and any
of the Valeant Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Valeant or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries in Valeant's or
such Valeant Subsidiary's published financial statements or other Valeant
Reporting Documents.

  

  

(h) Since January 1, 2009, none of Valeant, Valeant's independent accountants,
the Valeant Board or the audit committee of the Valeant Board has received any
oral or written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Valeant, (y) "material weakness"
in the internal controls over financial reporting of Valeant or (z) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of
Valeant who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Valeant.

  

  

(i) None of the Valeant Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2009 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act or a reporting issuer in any of the provinces of Canada
within the meaning of the Canadian Securities Laws.

  

  

SECTION 4.07. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Valeant for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it is declared effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to each of Biovail's stockholders and Valeant's
stockholders or at the time of each of the Biovail Stockholders Meeting and
the Valeant Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation is made by Valeant with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Biovail or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39

in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Valeant;

  

  

(d) any incurrence of material Indebtedness for borrowed money or any

Valeant Subsidiary of any material Tax liability or refund, other than in the
ordinary course of business.

proceeding or contest of any refund or deficiency in respect of Taxes is
pending in or on appeal from any Governmental Entity.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Each of Valeant and each Valeant Subsidiary has complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the withholding, collection and

circumstances which could subject it to a liability under section 160 of the
Income Tax Act (or the analogous provision of such other applicable Law).

  

  

(f) With respect to any transaction with any non-arm's length Person that is

market value thereof, nor (ii) received any consideration for any property
(including for the use of property) or services that is less than the fair
market value thereof. For all such transactions, each Valeant Subsidiary
resident in Canada has made or obtained records or documents that meet the
requirements of paragraphs 247(4)(a) to (c) of the Income Tax Act.

applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder (or a similar provision of state or
foreign Law).

  

  

(l) This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto) sets forth the complete
terms of the Merger. Neither Valeant nor any Valeant Subsidiary has taken any
other action or knows of any other fact relating to the Merger that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying for the Intended
Tax Treatment.

  

  

(m) No amounts paid or payable by Valeant or any Valeant Subsidiary as
employee compensation, whether under any contract, plan, program or
arrangement, understanding or otherwise (including any Valeant Benefit Plan or

reasonably be expected to be non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by
virtue of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.

43

SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation by Biovail; Biovail Board Recommendation. (a)
Biovail shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or
any of its and their respective directors, officers or employees or any of
their respective investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors,
agents or representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, (i) directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any
Biovail Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Biovail Takeover Proposal, (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Biovail's Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person any information
with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a
Person making a Biovail Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Biovail
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Biovail Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or
fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person (other than the other party hereto) with
respect to Biovail or any Biovail Subsidiary. Biovail (A) shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Biovail
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Biovail Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives and (B) shall immediately
take all steps necessary to terminate any approval under any confidentiality
or "standstill" or similar provision that may have been heretofore given by it
or any Biovail Subsidiary under any such provisions authorizing any Person to
make a Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Biovail Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
Biovail Takeover Proposal that the Biovail Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Biovail Proposal, and which Biovail Takeover Proposal was not
solicited by Biovail, its Affiliates or Representatives after the date of this
Agreement and was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), Biovail, and its Representatives
at the request of Biovail, may, subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c),
(A) furnish information with respect to Biovail and the Biovail Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Biovail Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to Valeant or
is provided to Valeant prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to standstill provisions), and (B) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Biovail Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Biovail
Takeover Proposal (and such Person's Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.02(a) by any Representative of Biovail or any of its Affiliates
shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Biovail.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Biovail Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Valeant),
or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Valeant),
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Biovail
Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Biovail Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Biovail Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly
to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Biovail or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)) (an "Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Biovail Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Biovail, BAC or Merger Sub to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, Biovail to fail to comply with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Biovail
Stockholder Approval, the Biovail Board may make a Biovail Adverse
Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a Biovail Takeover Proposal
after the execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.02(a) and that the Biovail Board or an authorized and empowered
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Biovail Proposal
or (B) solely in response to any material event, development, circumstance,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts (including any material change
in probability or magnitude of circumstances), not related to a Biovail
Takeover Proposal, and that first occurred following the execution of this
Agreement (a "Biovail Intervening Event"); in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), only if the Biovail Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that Biovail shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Biovail Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth business day
following Valeant's receipt of written notice (a "Biovail Notice of
Recommendation Change") from Biovail advising Valeant that the Biovail Board
intends to make a Biovail Notice of Recommendation Change and specifying the
reasons therefor, including in the case of a Superior Biovail Proposal the
terms and conditions of any Superior Biovail Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Biovail Board (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Biovail Proposal shall require
a new Biovail Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five business-day
period). In determining whether to make a Biovail Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Biovail Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Valeant in response to a Biovail Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise, and if requested by Valeant, Biovail shall
engage in good faith negotiations with Valeant regarding any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Valeant.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of Biovail set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.02, Biovail shall promptly advise (and in any event
within 24 hours) Valeant orally and in writing of any Biovail Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Biovail Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
any such Biovail Takeover Proposal. Biovail shall (i) keep Valeant informed in
all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any Biovail Takeover Proposal
and (ii) provide to Valeant as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged
between Biovail or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Person
making any such Biovail Takeover Proposal, on the other hand, that describes
any of the terms or conditions of any Biovail Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
the Biovail Board nor any committee thereof shall be entitled to make a
Biovail Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.02(b) with respect
to a Biovail Intervening Event, unless Biovail has provided Valeant with
written information describing such Biovail Intervening Event in reasonable
detail promptly after becoming aware of it, and keeps Valeant reasonably
informed of material developments with respect to such Biovail Intervening
Event.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Biovail from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Biovail if, in the good
faith judgment of the Biovail Board (after consultation with outside counsel)
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall Biovail or the
Biovail Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 5.02(b).

merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Biovail Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Biovail or
the Biovail Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of Biovail and the Biovail Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly,
to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting
power of Biovail, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of
any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or
more of the Biovail Common Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in

outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
to be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Biovail Common
Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
such proposal (including the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of the proposal and the identity of the Person making the proposal)
and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Valeant to the terms of
this Agreement) and (ii) that is fully financed or reasonably capable of being

SECTION 5.03. No Solicitation by Valeant; Valeant Board Recommendation. (a)
Valeant shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or
any of its and their respective Representatives to, (i) directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Valeant
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Valeant Takeover Proposal, (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Valeant's Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person any information
with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a
Person making a Valeant Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Valeant
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Valeant Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify or
fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person (other than the other party hereto) with
respect to Valeant or any Valeant Subsidiary. Valeant (A) shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Valeant
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Valeant Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives and (B) shall immediately
take all steps necessary to terminate any approval under any confidentiality
or "standstill" or similar provision that may have been heretofore given by it
or any Valeant Subsidiary under any such provisions authorizing any Person to
make a Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Valeant Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
Valeant Takeover Proposal that the Valeant Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Valeant Proposal, and which Valeant Takeover Proposal was not
solicited by Valeant, its Affiliates or Representatives after the date of this
Agreement and was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 5.03(a), Valeant, and its Representatives
at the request of Valeant, may, subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c),
(A) furnish information with respect to Valeant and the Valeant Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Valeant Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
(provided that all such information has previously been provided to Valeant or
is provided to Valeant prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to standstill provisions), and (B) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Valeant Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Valeant
Takeover Proposal (and such Person's Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.03(a) by any Representative of Valeant or any of its Affiliates
shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Valeant.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Valeant Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Biovail),
or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Biovail),
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Valeant
Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Valeant Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Valeant Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly
to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Valeant or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Valeant Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause,
Valeant to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, Valeant to fail to comply with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Valeant
Stockholder Approval, the Valeant Board may make a Valeant Adverse
Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a Valeant Takeover Proposal
after the execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.03(a) and that the Valeant Board or an authorized and empowered
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Valeant Proposal
or (B) solely in response to any material event, development, circumstance,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts (including any material change
in probability or magnitude of circumstances), not related to a Valeant
Takeover Proposal, and that first occurred following the execution of this
Agreement (a "Valeant Intervening Event"); in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), only if the Valeant Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that Valeant shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Valeant Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth business day
following Biovail's receipt of written notice (a "Valeant Notice of
Recommendation Change") from Valeant advising Biovail that the Valeant Board
intends to make a Valeant Notice of Recommendation Change and specifying the
reasons therefor, including in the case of a Superior Valeant Proposal the
terms and conditions of any Superior Valeant Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Valeant Board (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Valeant Proposal shall require
a new Valeant Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five business-day
period). In determining whether to make a Valeant Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Valeant Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Biovail in response to a Valeant Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise, and if requested by Biovail, Valeant shall
engage in good faith negotiations with Biovail regarding any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Biovail.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of Valeant set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.03, Valeant shall promptly advise (and in any event
within 24 hours) Biovail orally and in writing of any Valeant Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Valeant Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
any such Valeant Takeover Proposal. Valeant shall (i) keep Biovail informed in
all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any Valeant Takeover Proposal,
and (ii) provide to Biovail as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged
between Valeant or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Person
making any such Valeant Takeover Proposal, on the other hand, that describes
any of the terms or conditions of any Valeant Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
the Valeant Board nor any committee thereof shall be entitled to make a
Valeant Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.03(b) with respect
to a Valeant Intervening Event, unless Valeant has provided Biovail with
written information describing such Valeant Intervening Event in reasonable
detail promptly after becoming aware of it, and keeps Biovail reasonably
informed of material developments with respect to such Valeant Intervening
Event.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Valeant from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Valeant if, in the good
faith judgment of the Valeant Board (after consultation with outside counsel)
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall Valeant or the
Valeant Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 5.03(b).

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Valeant Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, amalgamation, arrangement,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar
transaction involving Valeant or any Valeant Subsidiary, (ii) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Valeant Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Valeant or
the Valeant Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of Valeant and the Valeant Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly,
to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting
power of Valeant, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of
any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which
beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or
more of the Valeant Common Stock or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in
each case, other than the Merger).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

"Superior Valeant Proposal" means a binding bona fide written Valeant Takeover
Proposal (with all references to "20% or more" in the definition of Valeant
Takeover Proposal being deemed to reference "more than 50%") (i) on terms
which the Valeant Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
to be superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Valeant Common
Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
such proposal (including the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of the proposal and the identity of the Person making the proposal)
and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Biovail to the terms of
this Agreement), and (ii) that is fully financed or reasonably capable of
being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all required governmental
approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed.

Additional Agreements

  

  

SECTION 6.01. Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of

amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or
the Canadian Securities Authorities with respect thereto, each of Valeant and
Biovail (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments
reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such

other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of the Merger Consideration for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and each of Valeant and Biovail shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Valeant and Biovail shall also take
any other action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
Merger and the issuance of the Merger Consideration.

as permitted by Section 5.02(b). Except as expressly contemplated by the
foregoing sentence, Biovail agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to Biovail of any Biovail Takeover
Proposal, the occurrence of a Biovail Intervening Event or by the making of

public disclosure or communication to Valeant of any Valeant Takeover
Proposal, the occurrence of a Valeant Intervening Event or by the making of
any Valeant Adverse Recommendation Change by the Valeant Board; provided,
however, that if the public announcement of a Valeant Adverse Recommendation
Change or the delivery of a Valeant Notice of Recommendation Change is less

more than ten Business Days after such event.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70

hold the Valeant Stockholders Meeting and the Biovail Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, at the same time and on the same date as the other party.

  

  

(g) Biovail shall take all action to ensure that all Biovail Common Stock

SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable
Law, each of Biovail and Valeant shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of such
other party reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, each of Biovail and Valeant shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, make available promptly to the other
party (a) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of securities laws and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request; provided, however, that either party may
withhold any document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party (provided that the withholding
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of
such third party to such access or disclosure) or subject to any attorney-
client privilege (provided that the withholding party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege). If any material is withheld by such party pursuant to the proviso
to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other party as to the
general nature of what is being withheld. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Valeant and Biovail shall, within two Business Days of
request by the other party therefor, provide to such other party the
information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any
information to which a holder of Valeant Common Stock would be entitled under
Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such
section). All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement dated September 28, 2009, as amended
on February 18, 2010, between Biovail and Valeant Pharmaceuticals North
America (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 6.03. Required Actions. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
reasonably appropriate to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably
possible, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), Valeant and the
Valeant Board and Biovail and the Biovail Board, as the case may be, shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably
appropriate to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), promptly
following the execution and delivery by the parties of this Agreement, Valeant
and Biovail shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to enter into
discussions with the Governmental Entities from whom Consents or nonactions
are required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to obtain
all such required Consents or nonactions from such Governmental Entities, in
each case with respect to the Merger, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible. To the extent necessary in order to accomplish
the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.03(e),
Valeant and Biovail shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
jointly propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or
prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by Valeant, Biovail or
any of their respective Subsidiaries of, any portion of the business,
properties or assets of Valeant, Biovail or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither Biovail nor Valeant shall be
required pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) to propose, commit to or effect any
action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or that
would reasonably be expected (after giving effect to any reasonably expected
proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets) to have a Combined Company
Material Adverse Effect.

"Supplementary Information Request" under the Competition Act), and not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or Competition Act or enter into any
agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to

Biovail or any Biovail Subsidiary without the prior written consent of

SECTION 6.04. Equity Awards; Change in Control Provisions.

  

  

(a) Options.

  

  

(i) Prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time, the Valeant Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required
consents) to adjust the terms of all outstanding Valeant Stock Options to
provide that, at the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time and prior to the
Effective Time, each Valeant Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time shall be converted into an option to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Valeant Stock
Option immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time, a number of
shares of Valeant Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Valeant Common Stock subject
to such Valeant Stock Option immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special
Dividend Time by the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Adjustment Ratio, at a per
share exercise price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of such Valeant Stock Option by the Pre-
Merger Special Dividend Adjustment Ratio; provided, however, that the
adjustments provided in this Section 6.04(a)(i) with respect to any Valeant
Stock Options, whether or not they are "incentive stock options" as defined in
Section 422 of the Code, are intended to be effected in a manner that is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Valeant Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) to adjust
the terms of all outstanding Valeant Stock Options to provide that, at the
Effective Time, each Valeant Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Valeant Stock Option following
the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time and immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a number of shares of Biovail Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Valeant Common
Stock subject to such Valeant Stock Option following the Pre-Merger Special
Dividend Time and immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, at a per share exercise price, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Valeant
Stock Option by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the
adjustments provided in this Section 6.04(a)(ii) with respect to any Valeant
Stock Options, whether or not they are "incentive stock options" as defined in
Section 422 of the Code, are intended to be effected in a manner that is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(b) Time-Based Restricted Stock Units.

  

  

(i) Prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time, the Valeant Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required
consents) to adjust the terms of all outstanding Valeant Restricted Stock
Units that are scheduled to vest, or which have already become vested, solely
based on the passage of time ("Valeant Time-Based Restricted Stock Units") to
provide that, unless otherwise agreed to by the award holder:

  

  

(A) at the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time and prior to the Effective Time,
except as provided in subparagraph (B) below, each award of Valeant Time-Based
Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special
Dividend Time shall represent the right to receive, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such award immediately prior to the Pre-
Merger Special Dividend Time, a number of shares of Valeant Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Valeant Common Stock subject to such award of Valeant Time-Based
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend
Time by the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Adjustment Ratio; and

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(B) with respect to each award of Valeant Time-Based Restricted Stock Units
that, by its terms as in effect on the date hereof, will vest (in whole or in
part) as a result of the Merger (each such award, a "Single-Trigger RSU"),
such Single-Trigger RSU shall vest as of the day prior to the date on which
occurs the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time to the extent provided under the
terms of such Single-Trigger RSU as in effect on the date hereof, as if such
day was the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the portion so vested, an
"Accelerated RSU") and shall represent, immediately after the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend Time and prior to the Effective Time, the right to receive,
(1) the same number of shares of Valeant Common Stock underlying the
Accelerated RSU (the "Accelerated Valeant RSU Shares") plus (2) an amount of
cash equal to the product of the Pre-Merger Special Dividend and the number of
Accelerated Valeant RSU Shares, which cash amount shall be paid (net of
applicable withholding) to or on behalf of the holder of the Accelerated RSU
on the date on which occurs the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time. Any portion
of the Single-Trigger RSU that does not become an Accelerated RSU (and any
right to the associated Pre-Merger Special Dividend) shall be forfeited for no
consideration at the Pre-Merger Dividend Time.

  

  

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Valeant Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) to adjust
the terms of all outstanding Valeant Time-Based Restricted Stock Units to
provide that, at the Effective Time each award of Valeant Time-Based
Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall represent, immediately after the Effective Time, the right to receive,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such award following
the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time and immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a number of shares of Biovail Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of Valeant Common
Stock subject to such award of Valeant Time-Based Restricted Stock Units
following the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time and immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. For the sake of clarity,
holders of Accelerated RSUs shall be entitled to receive shares of Biovail
Common Stock (net of applicable withholding) in settlement of such Accelerated
RSUs as soon as practicable following the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.

  

  

(i) Prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time, the Valeant Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required
consents) to adjust the terms of all outstanding Valeant Restricted Stock
Units that are scheduled to vest based in whole or in part on the achievement
of performance criteria ("Valeant Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units")
to provide that, except as disclosed in Section 6.04(c) of the Valeant
Disclosure Letter or unless otherwise agreed to by the award holder:

  

  

(A) all relevant performance periods applicable to the Valeant Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Units shall end on the day immediately preceding the
date on which occurs the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time, as if such day were
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and, as of such day, the number
of shares of Valeant Common Stock underlying each award of Valeant
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units shall be adjusted to reflect
performance through such day in accordance with the terms of such Valeant
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit as in effect on the date hereof (the
Valeant Performance-Based Restricted Stock award, as so adjusted, being
referred to as the "Valeant Adjusted PSU"). Any additional Valeant
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units which could have been earned through
performance but which are not so earned (and any right to the associated Pre-
Merger Special Dividend) shall be forfeited for no consideration at the Pre-
Merger Special Dividend Time; and

  

  

(B) each Valeant Adjusted PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend Time shall represent, immediately after the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend Time, the right to receive, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Valeant Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time (but determined as
if the Effective Time had occurred), (1) the same number of shares of Valeant
Common Stock underlying the Valeant Adjusted PSU (the "Valeant Adjusted PSU
Shares"), plus (2) an amount of cash equal to the product of the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend multiplied by the number of Valeant Adjusted PSU Shares,
which cash amount shall be paid (net of any applicable withholdings) to or on
behalf of the holders of Valeant Adjusted PSUs on the date on which occurs the
Pre-Merger Special Dividend Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Valeant Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) to adjust
the terms of all outstanding Valeant Adjusted PSUs to provide that, at the
Effective Time, each award of Valeant Adjusted PSUs outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall represent the right to receive, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time and net of applicable withholding, a
number of shares of Biovail Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, determined by multiplying the number of Valeant Adjusted PSU Shares
subject to such award by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Valeant Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
(including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) to effect
the following, without further action by any Person:

  

  

(i) after the date hereof, no future offering periods shall be commenced under
the Valeant ESPP. The current offering period in effect on the date hereof
under the Valeant ESPP will continue in accordance with its terms, and options
under the current offering period will be exercisable at the normally
scheduled time under the Valeant ESPP in accordance with its terms; provided,
however, that in all events the expiration of such offering period and the
final exercise under the Valeant ESPP shall occur prior to the Effective Time.
The Valeant ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately as of the Effective
Time;

  

  

(ii) ensure that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Valeant Stock
Option or Valeant Restricted Stock Unit (or former holder of a Valeant Stock
Option or Valeant Restricted Stock Unit or any current or former participant
in the Valeant Stock Plan, or in any other Valeant Benefit Plan or Valeant
Benefit Agreement), will have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock of Valeant or any Valeant Subsidiary or any other equity interest
therein; and

  

  

(iii) make such other changes to the Valeant Stock Plans as it deems
appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, Biovail shall assume all the obligations of Valeant
under the Valeant Stock Plans, each Valeant Stock Option and Valeant
Restricted Stock Unit outstanding at the Effective Time and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof (the "Valeant Stock Plan Assumption"). As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Biovail shall deliver to the holders
of Valeant Stock Options and Valeant Restricted Stock Units appropriate
notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Valeant
Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Valeant Stock
Options and Valeant Restricted Stock Units shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
6.04 after giving effect to the Merger).

  

  

(f) Biovail shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Biovail Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Valeant Stock Options and Valeant Restricted
Stock Units assumed in accordance with this Section 6.04. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Biovail shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Biovail Common Stock subject to Valeant
Stock Options and Valeant Restricted Stock Units and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Valeant Stock Options and
Valeant Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding.

  

  

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Biovail Board and the Valeant
Board shall irrevocably declare that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement constitute a change in control (or the equivalent thereof) under the
Biovail Benefit Plans (and awards thereunder), the Biovail Benefit Agreements,
the Valeant Benefit Plans (and awards thereunder) and the Valeant Benefit
Agreements, as the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 6.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) For a period of
six years from the Effective Time, Biovail shall maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of any
certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents of
each of Biovail, the Biovail Subsidiaries, Valeant and the Valeant
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and with
respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of Biovail, the Biovail Subsidiaries, Valeant or
the Valeant Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or
employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect
to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses provisions of Biovail's or the Surviving Company's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of Biovail, any of the
Biovail Subsidiaries, Valeant or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

79  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Biovail shall
indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or prior to the Effective
Time were officers, directors and employees of Biovail or the Biovail
Subsidiaries or were serving at the request of Biovail as an officer, director
or employee of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (collectively, the "Biovail
Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of Biovail or any of the Biovail
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided
under the Biovail Charter or Biovail Bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement (including with respect to the advancement of expenses).

  

  

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Biovail shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors and
employees of Valeant or the Valeant Subsidiaries or were serving at the
request of Valeant as an officer, director or employee of any other
corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise (collectively, the "Valeant Indemnitees" and, together with
the Biovail Indemnitees, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of
Valeant or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective
Time to the extent provided under the Valeant Charter or Valeant Bylaws in
effect on the date of this Agreement (including with respect to the
advancement of expenses). Biovail shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company
to, honor all indemnification agreements with the Indemnitees (including under
the Valeant Bylaws) in effect as of the date of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof.

  

  

(d) For six years after the Effective Time, Biovail shall procure the
provision of officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person
currently covered by Biovail's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less than those of
the policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Closing Date, Biovail may, following consultation with Valeant,
purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and
fiduciary liability insurance policy for Biovail and its respective current
and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained

the first sentence of this Section 6.05(d).

  

  

(e) For six years after the Effective Time, Biovail shall procure the
provision of officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person
currently covered by Valeant's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less than those of
the policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Closing Date, Valeant may, following consultation with Biovail,
purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and
fiduciary liability insurance policy for Valeant and its respective current
and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by Valeant, in which event Biovail or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this
Section 6.05(e).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(f) In the event that Biovail or the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Biovail

set forth in this Section 6.05.

  

  

(g) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to

(i) Valeant terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e); provided
that if either Valeant or Biovail terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(iii) at any time after Valeant would have been permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e), this Agreement shall be

that if either Valeant or Biovail terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(iv) at any time after Biovail would have been permitted to

deemed terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(f) for purposes of this Section
6.06(c)(i); or

(d) Biovail and Valeant acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
Sections 6.06(b) and 6.06(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
Valeant nor Biovail would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Biovail
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) or Valeant
fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(c), and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Person owed such payment commences a suit,
action or other proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor for such
payment, the Person owing such payment shall pay to the Person owed such

in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. In no event shall
either party be obligated to pay more than one termination fee pursuant to
this Section 6.06.

covenants requested by Tax counsel in order to render such Tax opinions, (ii)
not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely to prevent
such qualification or to prevent the obtaining of such Tax opinions and (iii)
executing such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in
order to obtain such qualification (it being understood that no party will be
required to agree to any such amendment). Each of Valeant, Biovail, BAC and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be
taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not
to be taken any action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the
representations and covenants made to Tax counsel in furtherance of such Tax
opinions. Each of Valeant, Biovail, BAC and Merger Sub will report the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

  

  

SECTION 6.08. Transaction Litigation. Biovail shall give Valeant the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against Biovail or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Valeant, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Valeant shall give
Biovail the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against Valeant or its directors relating to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Biovail,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without limiting in any way the parties' obligations under Section 6.03, each
of Biovail and Valeant shall cooperate, shall cause the Biovail Subsidiaries
and Valeant Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate, in the
defense against such litigation.

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Valeant immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any
acquisitions of Biovail Common Stock (including derivative securities with

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the financing and
related transactions (including the payment, refinancing and tendering of
existing indebtedness) (the "Financing") described in the executed commitment
letter attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Commitment Letter"), including using

Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining
the Financing set forth therein and (iii) consummate the Financing at or prior
to Closing, including (A) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
road shows, rating agency sessions and drafting sessions, and participating in
reasonable and customary due diligence, (B) furnishing the financial
institutions providing or arranging the Financing (the "Financing Sources")
with such financial and other pertinent information as may be reasonably
requested to consummate the Financing, including all financial statements and
financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act (including any required audits thereof, which shall be
unqualified) and of the type and form customarily included in private
placements pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, (C)
assisting the Financing Sources in the preparation of (1) an offering document
for any portion of the Financing and (2) materials for rating agency

of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or in any definitive
agreement related to the Financing. In the event any portion of the Financing

with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review

including the provision of information reasonably requested by Biovail in
connection therewith.

following the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01,

ARTICLE VII

  

  

Conditions Precedent

  

  

SECTION 7.01. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

  

  

(a) Stockholder Approvals. The Biovail Stockholder Approval and the Valeant
Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.

  

  

(b) Listing. The shares of Biovail Common Stock issuable (i) as Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) upon the conversion of
Valeant Convertible Notes, the exercise of Valeant Warrants or Valeant Stock
Options or the vesting of Valeant Restricted Stock Units, in each case under
this clause (ii) following the Effective Time, shall have been approved for
listing on the NYSE and the TSX, in each case subject to official notice of
issuance and, in the case of the TSX, to the making of certain prescribed
filings following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Governmental Approvals. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall
have expired. If the Merger is subject to the notification provisions of Part
IX of the Competition Act, either (i) the Commissioner of Competition or a
person authorized by her (the "Commissioner") shall have issued an advance
ruling certificate under Section 102 of the Competition Act or (ii) the
applicable waiting period under subsection 123(1) of the Competition Act shall
have expired or shall have been terminated early under subsection 123(2) of
the Competition Act, or the obligation to submit a notification under Part IX
of the Competition Act shall have been waived pursuant to paragraph 113(c) of
the Competition Act and, unless waived by Biovail, the Commissioner shall have
issued a No-Action Letter. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a "No-
Action Letter" means written advice to Biovail that the Commissioner presently
does not have sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal
under Section 92 or any other section of Part VIII of the Competition Act and,
therefore, does not, at such time, intend to make such application with
respect to the Merger, such advice not being conditional upon or having terms
and conditions that would reasonably be expected to result in a Combined
Company Material Adverse Effect. All Consents, if any, required to be obtained
(i) under any other foreign antitrust, competition, foreign investment, trade
regulation or similar Laws or (ii) from or of any other Governmental Entity,
in each case in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall have been obtained, except
for those Consents which are immaterial to the Combined Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) No Legal Restraints. No applicable Law and no Judgment, preliminary,
temporary or permanent, issued by any court or tribunal of competent
jurisdiction (collectively, the "Legal Restraints") shall be in effect, and no
suit, action or other proceeding shall have been instituted by any
Governmental Entity and remain pending which is reasonably likely to result in
a Legal Restraint, in each case, that prevents, makes illegal, or prohibits
the consummation of the Merger or that is (i) seeking to prohibit, materially
restrain or otherwise materially interfere with the Merger or the ownership or
operation of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Valeant
or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries or of Biovail or any of the Biovail
Subsidiaries or to compel Biovail or any Biovail Subsidiary to dispose of or
hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Valeant
or any of the Valeant Subsidiaries or of Biovail or any of the Biovail
Subsidiaries, or (ii) seeking divestiture of any shares of Valeant Common
Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Company) or seeking to impose or
confirm limitations on the ability of Biovail or any Biovail Subsidiary
effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Valeant
Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Company), including the
right to vote, in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii), which would
reasonably be expected (after giving effect to any reasonably expected
proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets) to have a Combined Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(e) Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective under the Securities
Act and shall not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a
stop order, and Biovail shall have received all state securities or "blue sky"
authorizations necessary for the issuance of the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(f) Financing. The Financing (or, in the event that alternative financing has
been jointly arranged by Biovail and Valeant, the alternative financing) shall
have been consummated.

  

  

(g) Pre-Merger Special Dividend. The Pre-Merger Special Dividend shall have
been paid to holders of Valeant Common Stock in accordance with Section 6.17.
For purposes of this Section 7.01(g), the Pre-Merger Special Dividend shall be
deemed to have been paid to holders of Valeant Common Stock at the time
Valeant irrevocably transfers cash for the Pre-Merger Special Dividend to the
relevant paying agent for the benefit of such stockholders.

  

  

SECTION 7.02. Conditions to Obligations of Valeant. The obligation of Valeant
to consummate the Merger is further subject to the following conditions:

  

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Biovail, BAC and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement (except for the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.03 and 3.17(c)) shall be
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality"
or "Biovail Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) at and as of the date
of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of
such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such

reasonably be expected to have a Biovail Material Adverse Effect, and the
representations and warranties of Biovail, BAC and Merger Sub contained in
Section 3.03 and Section 3.17(c) shall be true and correct in all material

reasonably satisfactory to Valeant, as of the Closing Date to the effect that
the Merger should qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. In rendering the
opinion described in this Section 7.02(d), the Tax counsel rendering such
opinion may require and rely upon (and may incorporate by reference)
reasonable and customary representations and covenants, including those
contained in certificates of officers of Valeant and Biovail.

  

  

SECTION 7.03. Conditions to Obligation of Biovail, BAC and Merger Sub. The

as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as if made
at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such

of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date). Biovail shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Valeant by an executive officer of
Valeant to such effect.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

90

result of a breach of this Agreement by such party or the failure of any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
true and correct;

  

  

(ii) if the condition set forth in Section 7.01(d) is not satisfied and the

of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of Biovail, BAC or Merger Sub contained herein
fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure (i) would give rise to

breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being
cured by Valeant by the End Date or is not cured by Valeant within forty-five
days after receiving written notice from Biovail (provided that Biovail is not
then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and no
representation or warranty of Biovail contained herein then fails to be true
and correct such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b)
could not then be satisfied);

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

92  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) by Valeant, in the event that a Biovail Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred; provided that Valeant shall no longer be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) if the Biovail
Stockholder Approval is obtained at the Biovail Stockholders Meeting; or

  

  

(f) by Biovail, in the event that a Valeant Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred; provided that Biovail shall no longer be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(f) if the Valeant
Stockholder Approval is obtained at the Valeant Stockholders Meeting.

  

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.01 shall give written notice of such

liability or obligation on the part of Valeant or Biovail, other than Section
3.20, Section 4.20, the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.06, this
Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination,
and except in the case of fraud or any intentional misrepresentation by a
party or any intentional breach by a party of any covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Biovail Stockholder Approval or the
Valeant Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that (i) after receipt of the
Biovail Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of Biovail without the further
approval of such stockholders, (ii) after receipt of the Valeant Stockholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the stockholders of Valeant without the further approval of such
stockholders, (iii) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time and (iv) except as provided above, no amendment of this
Agreement shall require the approval of the stockholders of Biovail or the
stockholders of Valeant. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of

Biovail shall require the approval of the stockholders of Biovail unless such
approval is required by Law and no extension or waiver by Valeant shall
require the approval of the stockholders of Valeant unless such approval is
required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

93  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 8.05. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Valeant,
Biovail, BAC or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee of its Board of Directors. Termination of this Agreement
prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders
of Biovail or Valeant.

  

  

SECTION 8.06. Alternative Structure. The parties hereby agree to cooperate in
the consideration of alternative structures to implement the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as long as there is no change in the economic
terms thereof and such alternative structure does not impose any material
delay on, or condition to, the consummation of the Merger, or adversely affect
any of the parties hereto or either Biovail's or Valeant's stockholders or
result in additional liability to Biovail's or Valeant's directors or
officers.

SECTION 9.04. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise
defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America.

  

  

SECTION 9.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under
this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

100  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 9.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

SECTION 9.07. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
taken together with the Biovail Disclosure Letter, the Valeant Disclosure
Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for Section 6.05,
is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or
remedies.

  

  

SECTION 9.08. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

  

  

SECTION 9.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 9.10. Specific Enforcement. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of
actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any
Federal court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than any Delaware state court or any Federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

101  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to
enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.11.

Delaware corporation ("New Merger Sub").

  

  

  

WHEREAS, Section 6.14 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger

SECTION 1.01. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall has the
meaning assigned to it in the Merger Agreement.

  

  

  

SECTION 1.02. All references in the Merger Agreement to "Merger Sub" shall be
deemed to refer to "New Merger Sub."

  

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Biovail and New Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Valeant that the statements contained in this Section 1.03 are true
and correct:

  

  

  

(a) BAC is the sole stockholder of New Merger Sub. Since its date of
formation, New Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor conducted any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and matters
ancillary thereto.

  

  

  

(b) New Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its respective obligations under this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, subject,

Biovail Stockholder Approval and (B) solely in the case of the Merger, for the
adoption of the Joinder Agreement by Biovail as the sole stockholder of New
Merger Sub, no other corporate proceedings on the part of New Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and Merger Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL). New Merger Sub has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Biovail and Valeant, this Agreement constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its

SECTION 1.03. New Merger Sub hereby becomes a party to the Merger Agreement
with the same force and effect as if originally named as a party therein and
hereby agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement
applicable to it.

the Merger Agreement and shall be subject to all of the provisions thereof.

B-3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Valeant, Biovail and Merger Sub have duly executed this

with GS Bank, "Goldman Sachs"), Jefferies Group, Inc. ("Jefferies") and Morgan
Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley", and together with Goldman
Sachs and Jefferies, the "Commitment Parties") is exclusively authorized by
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware corporation (the "Company")

subsidiaries, the "Merger Party" and, together with the Company, "you"), to
act as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and joint syndication agent in
connection with, and commits to provide the financing for, certain
transactions described herein, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this letter and the attached Annexes A, B and C hereto
(collectively, this "Commitment Letter"). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the respective meanings given in the Annexes hereto.

  

  

You have informed the Commitment Parties that the Company intends to
consummate a merger transaction with the Merger Party, pursuant to which the
Company will merge (the "Merger") with and into a newly-formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Merger Party, with the Company as the surviving entity. In
connection with, and immediately prior to, the Merger, the Company will (i)
tender for or call for redemption all of the Company's 8.375% Senior Notes due
2016 (the "2016 Notes") and all of the Company's 7.625% Senior Notes due 2020
(the "2020 Notes" and, together with the 2016 Notes, the "Existing Notes") and

indentures pursuant to which the Existing Notes were issued (the repayment of
such Existing Notes, along with any related fees, expenses and premiums, and
the consent solicitation of the holders of the Existing Notes, along with any
related fees and expenses, collectively, the "Refinancing") upon terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Commitment Parties and (ii) pay a
cash dividend of $1,314.0 million to the Company's existing shareholders (the
"Dividend"). You have also informed us that the Refinancing, the Dividend, the
Post-Merger Special Dividend (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the
Transaction Expenses and the working capital requirements of the Company and
the Merger Party after consummation of the Merger will be financed from the
following sources:

---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

●

  |

as follows:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

○

  |  

up to $1,972.0 million shall be available on the Closing Date to fund the
Refinancing and the Dividend;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

○

  |

Dividend to the shareholders of Parent after the consummation of the Merger;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

provided that the amount of the Term B Facility available to the Company on
the Closing Date shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by (i) the net
proceeds of any issuance of debt securities (the "Securities") consummated by
the Company after the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that remain outstanding on
the Closing Date, after giving effect to the making of the loans under the
Senior Facilities and the Refinancing and (iii) 50% of the net proceeds from
the sale of properties or assets or any interests therein that, individually
or in a series of related transactions, generate net proceeds in excess of
$25.0 million, until the aggregate net proceeds after the date hereof equals
$400.0 million and then 100% of any additional asset sale proceeds (except for
sales of pharmaceutical products in the ordinary course of business, which
shall not be subject to this clause (iii)); and

  

  

    

  |  

●

  |  

$250.0 million under a senior secured revolving credit facility (the
"Revolving Facility"; and, together with the Term Facilities, the "Senior
Facilities") having the terms set forth on Annex B.

1. Commitments: Titles and Roles.

  

  

Each of GSLP, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies is pleased to confirm its
commitment to act, and you hereby appoint each of GSLP, Morgan Stanley and
Jefferies to act, as joint lead arranger, joint bookrunner and joint
syndication agent in connection with the Senior Facilities and (i) GS Bank is
pleased to advise you of its several (but not joint) commitment to provide the
Borrower with 45% of the Senior Facilities, (ii) Morgan Stanley is pleased to
advise you of its several (but not joint) commitment to provide the Borrower
with 45% of the Senior Facilities, and (iii) Jefferies is pleased to advise
you of its several (but not joint) commitment to provide the Borrower with 10%
of the Senior Facilities, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (referred to
below). In addition, you hereby appoint GSLP to act as administrative agent
(the "Administrative Agent") for the Senior Facilities. You agree that GSLP
will have "left" placement in any and all marketing materials or other
documentation used in connection with the Senior Facilities. You further agree
that no other titles will be awarded and no compensation (other than that
expressly contemplated by this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter referred
to below) will be paid in connection with the Senior Facilities unless you and
we shall so agree. Our fees for our commitment and for services related to the
Senior Facilities are set forth in a separate fee letter (the "Fee Letter")
entered into by the Company, the Merger Party and the Commitment Parties on
the date hereof.

2. Conditions Precedent.

  

  

Each Commitment Party's commitment and agreements hereunder are subject to the
following condition: since January 1, 2010, there has not occurred any fact,
circumstance, effect, change, event or development that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below) on either the Company and its subsidiaries
or the Merger Party. Each Commitment Party's commitments and agreements are
also subject to the satisfactory negotiation, execution and delivery of
appropriate definitive loan documents relating to the Senior Facilities
including, without limitation, credit agreements, guarantees, security
agreements, pledge agreements, real property security agreements, opinions of
counsel and other related definitive documents (collectively, the "Loan
Documents") to be based upon and substantially consistent with the terms set
forth in this Commitment Letter (it being agreed that the Loan Documents shall
not contain any conditions precedent to the initial borrowing under the Senior
Facilities on the Closing Date other than the conditions precedent expressly
set forth herein and in Annexes B and C hereto, and the terms of the Loan
Documents will be such that they do not impair the availability of the Senior
Facilities on the Closing Date if such conditions are satisfied, it being
understood that, to the extent the creation or perfection of any security
interest in the collateral (as contemplated in Annex B hereto) is not or
cannot be provided or perfected on the Closing Date (other than (i) the pledge
and perfection of collateral with respect to which a lien may be perfected
solely by the filing of financing statements under the Uniform Commercial
Code, (ii) filings with the U.S. patent and trademark office and the U.S.
copyright office with respect to intellectual property collateral and (iii) to
the extent applicable, the delivery of certificated securities representing
intercompany debt or equity interests required to constitute collateral and
related security powers) after your use of commercially reasonable efforts to
do so, then the creation or perfection, as the case may be, of such security
interest shall not constitute a condition precedent to the availability of the
Senior Facilities on the Closing Date, but shall instead be provided as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event
within 30 days after the Closing Date plus any extensions granted by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) pursuant to arrangements to be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Administrative Agent). Each
Commitment Party's commitment is also subject to the Company having entered
into an engagement letter with one or more investment banks (the "Investment
Banks") reasonably acceptable to the Commitment Parties, pursuant to which the
Company engaged the Investment Banks in connection with a potential issuance
of Securities.

  

  

As used in the prior paragraph, "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect
to any person, any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development
that materially adversely affects the business, properties, financial
condition or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, excluding any effect that results from or arises in connection
with (i) changes or conditions generally affecting the industries in which
such person and any of its subsidiaries operate, except to the extent such
effect has a materially disproportionate effect on such person and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the industries in which
such person and any of its subsidiaries operate, (ii) general economic or
regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities, credit,
financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the United
States, Canada or any foreign jurisdiction, except to the extent such effect
has a materially disproportionate effect on such person and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to others in the industries in which such person
and any of its subsidiaries operate, (iii) any failure, in and of itself, by
such person to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial
or operating metrics for any period (it being understood that the facts or
occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be deemed to
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (iv) the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement or the public announcement or pendency of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the
impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of such person
or any of its subsidiaries with employees, labor unions, customers, suppliers
or partners, (v) any change, in and of itself, in the market price, credit
rating or trading volume of such person's securities (it being understood that
the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such change may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (vi) any change in applicable
Law (as defined in the Merger Agreement), regulation or GAAP (or authoritative
interpretation thereof), except to the extent such effect has a materially
disproportionate effect on such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to others in the industries in which such person and any of its
subsidiaries operate, (vii) geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or
escalation of hostilities, any acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any
escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism
threatened or underway as of the date of the Merger Agreement or (viii) any

Notwithstanding anything in this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or the Loan
Documents to the contrary, the only representations relating to the Company,
the Merger Party and their respective subsidiaries the accuracy of which will
be a condition to the availability of the Senior Facilities on the Closing
Date will be (i) the representations made by or with respect to the Company,
the Merger Party and their respective subsidiaries in the Merger Agreement
(but only to the extent that the Company or the Merger Party has the right to
terminate its obligations under the Merger Agreement or decline to consummate
the Merger as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties in
the Merger Agreement) and (ii) the Specified Representations (as defined
below).

  

  

As used herein, "Specified Representations" means representations relating to
incorporation or formation; organizational power and authority to enter into
the documentation relating to the Senior Facilities; due execution; delivery
and enforceability of such documentation; solvency; no conflicts with laws;
charter documents or material agreements; Federal Reserve margin regulations;
the Investment Company Act, Patriot Act; status of the Senior Facilities as
first lien senior debt; and, except as provided above, the creation,
perfection and priority of the security interests granted in the proposed
collateral.

  

  

3. Syndication.

  

  

The Arrangers intend, and reserve the right, to syndicate the Senior
Facilities to the Lenders promptly following the date hereof, and you
acknowledge and agree that the commencement of syndication shall occur in the
discretion of the Arrangers. The Arrangers will select the Lenders after
consultation with you. The Arrangers will lead the syndication, including
determining the timing of all offers to potential Lenders, any title of agent
or similar designations or roles awarded to any Lender and the acceptance of
commitments, the amounts offered and the compensation provided to each Lender
from the amounts to be paid to the Arrangers pursuant to the terms of this
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. The Arrangers will, in consultation with
you, determine the final commitment allocations and will notify the Company of
such determinations. You agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Arrangers' syndication efforts benefit from the existing
lending relationships of the Company and the Merger Party and their respective
subsidiaries. To facilitate an orderly and successful syndication of the
Senior Facilities, you agree that, until the earliest of (x) the termination
of the syndication as determined by the Arrangers, (y) the consummation of a
Successful Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) and (z) 90 days after
the Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Merger Party (including, in each
case, their respective subsidiaries) will syndicate or issue, attempt to
syndicate or issue, announce or authorize the announcement of the syndication
or issuance of, any debt facility or any debt or equity security of the Merger
Party or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates
(other than (a) the Senior Facilities and other indebtedness contemplated
hereby to remain outstanding after the Closing Date and (b) the issuance of
(i) common equity of the Merger Party to shareholders of the Company on the
Closing Date, (ii) the Securities (if any), (iii) equity issued in connection
with the conversion of any convertible debt securities of the Company or the
Merger Party, hedging arrangements or warrants and (iv) equity pursuant to
employee stock plans of the Company and the Merger Party and other similar
arrangements to be mutually agreed upon by you and the Arrangers) without the
prior written consent of the Arrangers.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

You agree to cooperate with the Commitment Parties, in connection with (i) the
preparation of one or more information packages regarding the business,
operations and financial projections of the Company and the Merger Party
(collectively, the "Confidential Information Memorandum") including, without
limitation, all information relating to the transactions contemplated
hereunder prepared by or on behalf of the Company or the Merger Party deemed
reasonably necessary by the Commitment Parties to complete the syndication of
the Senior Facilities including, without limitation, using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain (a) a public corporate family rating from Moody's
Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's") for the Company, (b) a public corporate
credit rating from Standard and Poor's Ratings Group, a division of The McGraw
Hill Corporation ("SandP")) for the Company and (c) a public credit rating for
the Senior Facilities from each of Moody's and SandP, and (ii) the presentation
of one or more information packages reasonably acceptable in format and
content to the Commitment Parties (collectively, the "Lender Presentation") in
meetings and other communications with prospective Lenders or agents in
connection with the syndication of the Senior Facilities (including, without
limitation, direct contact between senior management and representatives, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and the Merger Party with
prospective Lenders and participation of such persons in meetings). You
further agree that the commitments and agreements of the Commitment Parties
hereunder are conditioned upon your satisfaction of the requirements of the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph by a date sufficient to afford the
Arrangers a period of at least 30 consecutive days following the launch of the
general syndication of the Senior Facilities to syndicate the Senior
Facilities prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Annex B); provided that
such period will not include any day from and including August 23, 2010
through September 6, 2010 or December 18, 2010 through January 3, 2011. You
will be solely responsible for the contents of any such Confidential
Information Memorandum and Lender Presentation (other than, in each case, any
information contained therein that has been provided for inclusion therein by
the Commitment Parties solely to the extent such information relates to the
Commitment Parties) and all other information, documentation or materials
delivered to the Arrangers in connection therewith (collectively, the
"Information") and you acknowledge that the Commitment Parties will be using
and relying upon the Information without independent verification thereof. You
agree that Information regarding the Senior Facilities and Information
provided by the Company and the Merger Party or their respective
representatives to the Arrangers in connection with the Senior Facilities
(including, without limitation, draft and execution versions of the Loan
Documents, the Confidential Information Memorandum, the Lender Presentation,
publicly filed financial statements, and draft or final offering materials
relating to contemporaneous securities issuances by the Company or the Merger
Party) may be disseminated to potential Lenders and other persons through one
or more internet sites (including an IntraLinks, SyndTrak or other electronic
workspace (the "Platform")) created for purposes of syndicating the Senior
Facilities or otherwise, in accordance with the Arrangers' standard
syndication practices, and you acknowledge that neither the Arrangers nor any
of their affiliates will be responsible or liable to you or any other person
or entity for damages arising from the use by others of any Information or
other materials obtained on the Platform, except, in the case of damages to
you but not to any other person, to the extent such damages are found by a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Arranger or any of its affiliates or
any of their respective directors, employees, advisors or agents.

  

  

You acknowledge that certain of the Lenders may be "public side" Lenders (i.e.
Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with
respect to the Company, the Merger Party or their respective affiliates or any
of its or their respective securities) (each, a "Public Lender"). At the
request of the Arrangers, you agree to prepare an additional version of the
Confidential Information Memorandum and the Lender Presentation to be used by
Public Lenders that does not contain material non-public information
concerning the Company, the Merger Party or their respective affiliates or
securities. It is understood that in connection with your assistance described
above, at the request of the Arrangers, you will provide, and cause all other
applicable persons to provide, authorization letters to the Arrangers
authorizing the distribution of the Information to prospective Lenders,
containing a representation to the Arrangers that the public-side version does
not include material non-public information about the Company, the Merger
Party or their respective affiliates or its or their respective securities. In
addition, you will clearly designate as such all Information provided to the
Commitment Parties by or on behalf of the Company or the Merger Party which is
suitable to make available to Public Lenders. You acknowledge and agree that
the following documents may be distributed to Public Lenders, unless you
advise the Arrangers in writing (including by email) within a reasonable time
prior to their intended distributions that such material should only be
distributed to prospective Lenders that are not Public Lenders: (a) drafts and
final versions of the Loan Documents; (b) administrative materials prepared by
the Arrangers for prospective Lenders (such as a lender meeting invitation,
allocations and funding and closing memoranda); and (c) term sheets and
notification of changes in the terms of the Senior Facilities.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

4. Information.

  

  

You represent and covenant that (i) all written Information (other than
financial projections and information of a general economic or industry
specific nature) provided directly or indirectly by the Merger Party or the
Company to the Commitment Parties or the Lenders in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder is and will be, when furnished and when
taken as a whole and giving effect to all supplements thereto, complete and
correct in all material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading and (ii) the financial
projections that have been or will be made available to the Arrangers or the
Lenders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder by or on
behalf of the Company or the Merger Party have been and will be prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions that are believed by the preparer thereof to
be reasonable at the time such financial projections are furnished to the
Commitment Parties or the Lenders, it being understood and agreed that
financial projections are not a guarantee of financial performance and actual
results may differ from financial projections and such differences may be
material. You agree that if at any time prior to the Successful Syndication of
the Senior Facilities as determined by the Arrangers, any of the
representations in the preceding sentence would be incorrect in any material
respect if the Information and financial projections were being furnished, and
such representations were being made, at such time, then you will promptly
supplement, or cause to be supplemented, the Information and financial
projections so that such representations will be correct in all material
respects under those circumstances.

  

  

5. Indemnification and Related Matters.

  

  

In connection with arrangements such as this, it is the Commitment Parties'
policy to receive indemnification. You agree to the provisions with respect to
our indemnity and other matters set forth in Annex A, which is incorporated by
reference into this Commitment Letter.

  

  

6. Assignments; Amendments.

  

  

This Commitment Letter may not be assigned by you without the prior written
consent of the Commitment Parties (and any purported assignment without such
consent will be null and void), is intended to be solely for the benefit of
the Commitment Parties and the other parties hereto and, except as set forth
in Annex A hereto, is not intended to confer any benefits upon, or create any
rights in favor of, any person other than the parties hereto. Each of the
Commitment Parties may assign its commitments and agreements hereunder, in
whole or in part, to any of its affiliates (provided that such affiliates
agree to abide by the confidentiality provisions of Section 7 of this
Commitment Letter) and, as provided above, to any Lender prior to the Closing
Date; provided that any assignment by a Commitment Party to any potential
Lender made prior to the Closing Date shall not relieve such Commitment Party
of its obligations set forth herein to fund that portion of the commitments so
assigned. Neither this Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter may be amended or
any term or provision hereof or thereof waived or otherwise modified except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto or thereto, as
applicable, and any term or provision hereof or thereof may be amended or
waived only by a written agreement executed and delivered by all parties
hereto or thereto.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

7. Confidentiality.

  


 

  

Please note that this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and any written
communications provided by, or oral discussions with, the Commitment Parties
in connection with this arrangement are exclusively for the information of the
Company and the Merger Party and may not be disclosed to any third party or
circulated or referred to publicly without our prior written consent except,
after providing written notice to the Commitment Parties, pursuant to a
subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
judicial, administrative or legislative body or committee; provided that we
hereby consent to your disclosure of (i) this Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter and such communications and discussions to the Company's and the Merger
Party's respective directors, employees, agents and advisors who are directly
involved in the consideration of the Senior Facilities and who have been
informed by you of the confidential nature of such advice and the Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter and who have agreed to treat such information
confidentially, (ii) this Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and such
communications and discussions as required by applicable law, rule or
regulation or compulsory legal process (in which case you agree to inform us
promptly thereof to the extent not prohibited by law), (iii) the terms of this
Commitment Letter (but not the Fee Letter or the terms thereof, other than the
aggregate amount of financing fees payable to the Commitment Parties) and
related communications or discussions in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
(iv) the information contained in Annex B to Moody's and SandP; provided that
such information is supplied only on a confidential basis after consultation
with the Commitment Parties.

  

  

Each Commitment Party agrees that it will treat as confidential all
information provided to it hereunder by or on behalf of you or any of your
respective subsidiaries or affiliates; provided, however, that nothing herein
will prevent any Commitment Party from disclosing any such information (a)
pursuant to the order of any court or administrative agency or in any pending
legal or administrative proceeding, or otherwise as required by applicable law
or compulsory legal process (in which case such person agrees to inform you
promptly thereof to the extent not prohibited by law), (b) upon the request or
demand of any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such person or any
of its affiliates, (c) to the extent that such information is publicly
available or becomes publicly available other than by reason of improper
disclosure by such person, (d) to such person's affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, legal counsel,
independent auditors and other experts or agents who need to know such
information and on a confidential basis, (e) to potential and prospective
Lenders, participants and any direct or indirect contractual counterparties to
any swap or derivative transaction relating to the borrower and its
obligations under the Senior Facilities, in each case, who are advised of the
confidential nature of such information, (f) to Moody's and SandP; provided that
such information is limited to Annex B and is supplied only on a confidential
basis after consultation with you or (g) for purposes of establishing a "due
diligence" defense. Each Commitment Party's obligation under this provision
shall remain in effect until the earlier of (i) one year from the date hereof
and (ii) the date the definitive Loan Documents are entered into by the
Commitment Parties, at which time any confidentiality undertaking in the
definitive Loan Documents shall supersede this provision.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

8. Absence of Fiduciary Relationship; Affiliates; Etc.

  

  

As you know, each Commitment Party, together with its respective affiliates
(each collectively, a "Commitment Party Group"), is a full service financial
services firm engaged, either directly or through affiliates, in various
activities, including securities trading, investment banking and financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities and financial planning and benefits counseling for both
companies and individuals. In the ordinary course of these activities, each
Commitment Party Group may make or hold a broad array of investments and
actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and/or financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and
for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short
positions in such securities and/or instruments. Such investment and other
activities may involve securities and instruments of the Company or the Merger
Party, as well as of other entities and persons and their affiliates which may
(i) be involved in transactions arising from or relating to the engagement
contemplated by this Commitment Letter, (ii) be customers or competitors of
the Company or the Merger Party, or (iii) have other relationships with either
of you. In addition, each Commitment Party Group may provide investment
banking, underwriting and financial advisory services to such other entities
and persons. Each Commitment Party Group may also co-invest with, make direct
investments in, and invest or co-invest client monies in or with funds or
other investment vehicles managed by other parties, and such funds or other
investment vehicles may trade or make investments in securities of the
Company, the Merger Party or such other entities. The transactions
contemplated by this Commitment Letter may have a direct or indirect impact on
the investments, securities or instruments referred to in this paragraph.
Although each Commitment Party Group in the course of such other activities
and relationships may acquire information about the transaction contemplated
by this Commitment Letter or other entities and persons which may be the
subject of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter, no
Commitment Party Group shall have any obligation to disclose such information,
or the fact that such Commitment Party Group is in possession of such
information, to the Company or the Merger Party or to use such information on
the Company's or the Merger Party's behalf.

  

  

Consistent with their respective policies to hold in confidence the affairs of
its customers, no Commitment Party Group will furnish confidential information
obtained from you by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this
Commitment Letter to any of its other customers. Furthermore, you acknowledge
that no Commitment Party Group and none of their respective affiliates has an
obligation to use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Commitment Letter, or to furnish to you, confidential information obtained or
that may be obtained by them from any other person.

  

  

Each Commitment Party Group may have economic interests that conflict with
yours, or your respective equity holders and/or affiliates. You agree that
each Commitment Party Group will act under this Commitment Letter as an
independent contractor and that nothing in this Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency
relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Commitment Party
Group and the Company or the Merger Party or your respective equity holders or
affiliates. You acknowledge and agree that the transactions contemplated by
this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (including the exercise of rights
and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm's-length commercial
transactions between the Commitment Party Groups, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other, and in connection therewith and with the process
leading thereto, (i) no Commitment Party Group has assumed (A) an advisory or
fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Merger Party or your
respective equity holders or affiliates with Company or the Merger Party or
your respective equity holders or affiliates with respect to the financing
transactions contemplated hereby, or in each case, the exercise of rights or
remedies with respect thereto or the process leading thereto (irrespective of
whether such Commitment Party has advised, is currently advising or will
advise the Company, its equity holders or its affiliates on other matters) or
any other obligation to the Company or the Merger Party except the obligations
expressly set forth in this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter and (ii) each
Commitment Party Group is acting solely as a principal and not as the agent or
fiduciary of the Company, its management, equity holders, affiliates,
creditors or any other person. Each of you acknowledge and agree that you have
consulted your own legal and financial advisors to the extent you deemed
appropriate and that you are responsible for making your own independent
judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto.
You each agree that you will not claim that any Commitment Party Group has
rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or
similar duty to the Company or the Merger Party, in connection with such
transactions or the process leading thereto.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Without limiting any other provision of this Section 8, the Company and the
Merger Party (i) expressly agree that this Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter are being addressed to each of you solely at your mutual request, (ii)
acknowledge that circumstances may arise where the interests of the Company
and the Merger Party hereunder and/or under the Fee Letter are adverse to one
another and (iii) agree not to assert any claim that you might allege based on
any actual or potential conflict arising from the fact that both of you are
parties to this Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter including, but not
limited to, any such claim arising or resulting from the separate retention by
either of the Company or the Merger Party of any Commitment Party or any
affiliate thereof as an advisor in connection with the Merger and such
Commitment Party's or such affiliate's commitments, agreements and acts under
this Commitment Letter.

  

  

In addition, each Commitment Party may employ the services of its affiliates
in providing services and/or performing their obligations hereunder and may
exchange with such affiliates information concerning the Company, the Merger
Party and other companies that may be the subject of this arrangement, and
such affiliates will be entitled to the benefits afforded to the Commitment
Parties hereunder.

  

  

In addition, please note that the Commitment Parties do not provide
accounting, tax or legal advice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Company and the Merger Party (and each employee,
representative or other agent of the Company and the Merger Party) may
disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the Senior Facilities and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to you
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any information
relating to the tax treatment or tax structure will remain subject to the
confidentiality provisions hereof (and the foregoing sentence will not apply)
to the extent reasonably necessary to enable the parties hereto, their
respective affiliates, and their and their respective affiliates' directors
and employees to comply with applicable securities laws. For this purpose,
"tax treatment" means U.S. federal or state income tax treatment, and "tax
structure" is limited to any facts relevant to the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter but does
not include information relating to the identity of the parties hereto or any
of their respective affiliates.

  

  

9. Miscellaneous.

  

  

Each Commitment Party's commitments and agreements hereunder will terminate
upon the first to occur of (i) the consummation of the Merger, (ii) the
abandonment or termination of the definitive documentation for the Merger
(including the exhibits, schedules and all related documents) (the "Merger
Agreement"), (iii) a material breach by the Company or the Merger Party under
this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter and (iv) February 28, 2011, unless
the closing of the Senior Facilities, on the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, has been consummated on or before such date.

  

  

The provisions set forth under Sections 3, 4, 5 (including Annex A) and 7
hereof and this Section 9 hereof will remain in full force and effect
regardless of whether definitive Loan Documents are executed and delivered.
The provisions set forth under Sections 5 (including Annex A) and 7 hereof and
this Section 9 will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the
expiration or termination of this Commitment Letter or the Commitment Parties'
commitments and agreements hereunder.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

The Company and the Merger Party each agrees for itself and its affiliates
that any suit or proceeding arising in respect to this Commitment Letter or
the Commitment Parties' commitments or agreements hereunder or the Fee Letter
will be tried exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York or, if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in
any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York,
and the Company and the Merger Party each agree to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of, and to venue in, such court. Any right to trial by jury with
respect to any action or proceeding arising in connection with or as a result
of either the Commitment Parties' commitments or agreements or any matter
referred to in this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter is hereby waived by
the parties hereto. This Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. The Merger Party shall provide
evidence that it has appointed CT Corporation, as its agent for service of
process for purpose of the submission to jurisdiction set forth above.

  

  

The Commitment Parties hereby notify the Company and the Merger Party that
pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot Act") the Commitment
Parties and each Lender may be required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower and each of the Guarantors, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and each of the
Guarantors and other information that will allow the Commitment Parties and
each Lender to identify the Borrower and each of the Guarantors in accordance
with the Patriot Act. This notice is given in accordance with the requirements
of the Patriot Act and is effective for the Commitment Parties and each
Lender.

  

  

This Commitment Letter may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which when executed will be an original, and all of which, when taken
together, will constitute one agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Commitment Letter by facsimile transmission or
electronic transmission (in pdf or tif format) will be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart hereof. This Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter are the only agreements that have been entered into among the parties
hereto with respect to the Senior Facilities and set forth the entire
understanding of the parties with respect thereto and supersede any prior
written or oral agreements among the parties hereto with respect to the Senior
Facilities.

Commitment Letter, together, if not previously executed and delivered, with

Annex A

  


 

  

In the event that any Commitment Party becomes involved in any capacity in any
action, proceeding or investigation brought by or against any person,
including shareholders, partners, members or other equity holders of the
Company or the Merger Party in connection with or as a result of either this
arrangement or any matter referred to in this Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter (together, the "Letters'), the Company and the Merger Party each agree
to periodically reimburse each Commitment Party for its reasonable legal and
other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation)
incurred in connection therewith. The Company and the Merger Party each also
agrees to indemnify and hold each Commitment Party harmless against any and
all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to any such person in connection
with or as a result of either this arrangement or any matter referred to in
the Letters (whether or not such investigation, litigation, claim or
proceeding is brought by you, your equity holders or creditors or an
indemnified person and whether or not any such indemnified person is otherwise
a party thereto), except to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or
liability has been found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Commitment Party in performing the services that are the
subject of the Letters. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is
unavailable to any Commitment Party or insufficient to hold it harmless, then
the Company and the Merger Party will contribute to the amount paid or payable
by the Commitment Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative economic
interests of (:) the Company and the Merger Party and their respective
affiliates, shareholders, partners, members or other equity holders on the one
hand and (ii) the Commitment Parties on the other hand in the matters
contemplated by the Letters as well as the relative fault of (i) the Company
and the Merger Party and their respective affiliates, shareholders, partners,
members or other equity holders and (ii) the Commitment Parties with respect
to such loss, claim, damage or liability and any other relevant equitable
considerations. The reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations of
the Company and the Merger Party under this paragraph will be in addition to
any liability which the Company or the Merger Party may otherwise have, will
extend upon the same terms and conditions to any affiliate of a Commitment
Party and the partners, members, directors, agents, employees and controlling
persons (if any), as the case may be, of such Commitment Party and any such
affiliate, and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Company and the
Merger Party, each Commitment Party, any such affiliate and any such person.
The Company and the Merger Party each also agrees that neither any indemnified
party nor any of such affiliates, partners, members, directors, agents,
employees or controlling persons will have any liability to the Company or the
Merger Party or any person asserting claims on behalf of or in right of the
Company or the Merger Party or any other person in connection with or as a
result of either this arrangement or any matter referred to in the Letters,
except to the extent that any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
incurred by the Company, the Merger Party or their respective affiliates,
shareholders, partners or other equity holders have been found by a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnified party in
performing the services that are the subject of the Letters; provided,
however, that in no event will such indemnified party or such other parties
have any liability for any indirect, consequential, special or punitive
damages in connection with or as a result of such indemnified party's or such
other parties' activities related to the Letters. Each of the Company and the
Merger Party agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Commitment Letter to
the contrary and without limiting the Commitment Parties rights, remedies and
defenses thereunder, in no event shall the Commitment Parties or their
partners, members, directors, agents, employees, controlling persons or
affiliates be liable (in the aggregate) to the Company or the Merger Party (or
their respective shareholders, partners, members or other equity holders) for
damages under this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter or related to the
financing contemplated thereby in an amount in excess of $100.0 million.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Annex A-1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Neither the Company nor the Merger Party will be required to indemnify any
Commitment Parties for any amount paid or payable by such Commitment Party in
the settlement of any action, proceeding or investigation without such party's
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided
that the foregoing indemnity will apply to any such settlement in the event
that the Company or the Merger Party, as applicable, were offered the ability
to assume the defense of the action that was the subject matter of such
settlement and elected not to so assume. The provisions of this Annex A will
survive any termination or completion of the arrangement provided by the
Letters.

Interest Rate:

  |  

All amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities will bear interest, at the

   |  |  

With respect to loans made under the Term A Facility and the Revolving
Facility:

  

   
   |  |  

(i)

  |  

at the Base Rate plus 3.50% per annum; or

  

   
   |  |  

(ii)

  |  

at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4.50% per annum;

  

   
   |  |  

With respect to loans made under the Term B Facility:

  

   
   |  |  

(i)

  |  

at the Base Rate plus 3.75% per annum; or

  

   
   |  |  

(ii)

  |  

at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4.75% per annum;

  

   
   |  

provided, that the interest rate margins for the Senior Facilities set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) above with respect to each of the Term A Facility, the
Term B Facility and the Revolving Facility shall be (x) decreased by 0.25% if
the credit ratings for the Senior Facilities are at least Ba3 (stable) from
Moody's and BB- (stable) from SandP prior to the Closing Date and (y) increased
by 0.75% if the credit rating for the Senior Facilities is B2 (stable) or
lower from Moody's or B (stable) or lower from SandP prior to the Closing Date.

  

   
   |  

As used herein, the terms "Base Rate" and "reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate"
will have meanings customary and appropriate for financings of this type, and
the basis for calculating accrued interest and the interest periods for loans
bearing interest at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate will be customary and
appropriate for financings of this type subject, in the case of the Term B
Facility only, to a reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate "floor" of 1.75% and a
Base Rate "floor" of 2.75%. In no event shall the Base Rate be less than the
sum of (i) the one-month reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate (after giving effect
to any reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate "floor") plus (ii) the difference
between the applicable stated margin for reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate
loans and the applicable stated margin for Base Rate loans. After the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, interest on all
amounts then outstanding will accrue at a rate equal to the rate on loans
bearing interest at the rate determined by reference to the Base Rate plus an
additional two percentage points (2.00%) per annum and will be payable on
demand.

  

   
 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Annex B-4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

    

Interest Payments:

  

  |  

Quarterly for loans bearing interest by reference to the Base Rate; except as
set forth below, on the last day of selected interest periods (which will be
one, two, three and six months and any other period mutually agreed upon by
the Borrower and the Lenders under the Revolving Facility) for loans bearing
interest by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (and at the end of every three
months, in the case of interest periods of longer than three months); and upon
prepayment, in each case payable in arrears and computed on the basis of a
360-day year (365/366 day year with respect to loans bearing interest by
reference to the Base Rate).

  

   
---|--- 
  

Interest Rate Protection:

  

  |  

Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Borrower will obtain from a
counterparty satisfactory to the Administrative Agent interest rate protection
through interest rate swaps, caps or other agreements satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent against increases in the interest rates with respect to a
notional amount of indebtedness such that not less than 35% of the total
funded indebtedness of the Parent and its subsidiaries outstanding as of the
Closing Date will be either (i) subject to such interest rate protection
agreements or (ii) fixed rate indebtedness, in each case for a period of not
less than three years.

  

   
  

Funding Protection:

  

  |  

Customary for transactions of this type, including breakage costs, gross-up
for withholding, compensation for increased costs and compliance with capital
adequacy and other regulatory restrictions. The Loan Documents will contain
customary Lender mitigation and replacement provisions.

  

   
  

Commitment Fees:

  

  |  

Commitment fees equal to 0.75% per annum times the daily average undrawn
portion of the Revolving Facility (reduced by the amount of Letters of Credit
issued and outstanding) will accrue from the Closing Date and will be payable
quarterly in arrears.

  

   
  

Delayed Draw Fee:

  

  |  

Commitment fees equal to 0.75% per annum times the undrawn amount of
commitments under the Delayed-Draw Tranche will accrue from the Closing Date
and will be payable quarterly in arrears.

  

   
  

Letters of Credit Fees:

  |  

A fee equal to (i) the applicable margin then in effect for loans bearing
interest at the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate made under the Revolving
Facility, times (ii) the average daily maximum aggregate amount available to
be drawn under all Letters of Credit, will be payable quarterly in arrears to
the Lenders under the Revolving Facility. In addition, a fronting fee, to be
agreed upon between the issuer of each Letter of Credit and the Borrower, will
be payable to such issuer, as well as certain customary fees assessed thereby.

  

   
 Voluntary Prepayments | The Senior Facilities may be prepaid in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that loans bearing interest with
reference to the reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate will be prepayable only on
the last day of the related interest period unless the Borrower pays any
related breakage costs. Voluntary prepayments of the Term Facilities will be
applied to scheduled amortization payments as directed by the Borrower.

and 100% of the capital stock of each subsidiary of the Parent that is not
also a subsidiary of the Borrower, and all intercompany debt. All security

will be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and the Arrangers and, subject to the limitations set forth in the
Commitment Letter, will be perfected on the Closing Date; provided, that with
respect to guarantees and collateral documentation regarding the Merger Party,
such documentation shall be been delivered in escrow to counsel to the

credit rights (other than letter of credit rights that are supporting
obligations), (c) deposit accounts the funds in which are used solely for the

subsidiary of the Parent (with subsidiaries the minority interest in which is
held by management, directors or employees of the Parent or its subsidiaries
or consists of rolled-over equity to be treated as wholly owned for purposes
of the foregoing) if the organizational or governance documents of such person
prohibit the grant of a security interest therein without the consent of any
third party, (e) any license, contract or agreement if the grant of a security
interest therein would result in a breach thereof (other than to the extent
that any such provision would be rendered ineffective pursuant to applicable
provisions of the UCC), (f) any equipment owned by the Borrower or any
Guarantor that is subject to a purchase money security interest if the
agreement pursuant to which such purchase money security interest has been

owned real property and commercial tort claims) if the Administrative Agent,
in consultation with the Borrower, determines that the cost or burden of
creating or perfecting a security interest therein shall be excessive in view
of the benefits to be obtained by the Lenders therefrom.

  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fact or matter that would cause a default

$1.0 million with respect to the Term B Facility, any part of, their
respective shares of the Senior Facilities to their affiliates (other than

entities that are eligible assignees (to be defined in the Loan Documents)

Revolving Facility (except in the case of assignments made by or to Goldman
Sachs), are reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (except

not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon such assignment, such

purposes under the Loan Documents; provided, that assignments made to
affiliates and other Lenders will not be subject to the above described
consent or minimum assignment amount requirements. A $3,500 processing fee
will be required in connection with any such assignment. The Lenders will also

Amendments and waivers will require the approval of Lenders holding more than
50% of total commitments or exposure under the Senior Facilities, except that
(x) any amendment that would disproportionately affect the obligation of the
Borrower to make payment of the loans under either the Revolving Facility or
the Term Facilities will not be effective without the approval of holders of
more than 50% of such class of loans and (y) with respect to matters relating
to the interest rates, maturity, amortization, certain collateral issues and
the definition of Requisite Lenders, consent of each Lender directly and
adversely affected thereby shall be required.

Lenders will furnish to the Administrative Agent appropriate certificates or
other evidence of exemption from U.S. federal tax withholding.
