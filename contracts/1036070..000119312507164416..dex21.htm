Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

2.1 Conversion of Shares.

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of VFG or FNB or their respective stockholders:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of FNB ("FNB
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date
will be converted into and exchanged for 1.585 fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Continuing
Corporation ("Continuing Corporation Common Stock") pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan of Merger (the "Exchange
Ratio").

(b) All shares of FNB Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section 2.1
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date. Each certificate
previously representing any such shares (the "Old FNB Certificates") shall
cease to represent any rights except the right to receive with respect
to each underlying share of FNB Common Stock (i) a new certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
into which the shares of FNB Common Stock represented by the Old FNB
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 upon the
surrender of such Old FNB Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, (ii) in
accordance with Section 2.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock; and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of VFG ("VFG Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock. Each certificate previously representing shares of VFG Common
Stock shall continue to represent an equal number of shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock on and after the Effective Date.

(d) In the event VFG or FNB changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of shares of its common stock issued and outstanding
before the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction with
respect to its  



 

3  outstanding common stock, and the record date therefor shall be before the
Effective Date, appropriate and proportional adjustments will be made to
the Exchange Ratio.

(e) Each share of FNB Common Stock held by either party and each share of VFG
Common Stock held by FNB or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date (in
each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third
parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and no consideration
shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such shares of VFG Common
Stock shall resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a) At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by VFG and FNB
(in such capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
the Old FNB Certificates, certificates representing Continuing Corporation
Common Stock ("New Certificates"), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid hereunder in lieu
of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, without any
interest thereon (the "Exchange Fund"), to be paid pursuant to Article 1 and
this Article 2 in exchange for outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder
of record of FNB immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials
for use in exchanging such stockholderÂ’s Old FNB Certificates for New
Certificates based upon the Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) At its election, the Continuing Corporation may, but shall not be required
to, cause the Exchange Agent to send to each stockholder of record of VFG
immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use in
exchanging such stockholderÂ’s certificates representing shares of VFG Common
Stock ("Old VFG Certificates") for New Certificates representing an equal
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock. If the Continuing
Corporation elects to require the surrender of the Old VFG Certificates, it
shall comply with Section 2.2(a) above with respect to, and for the benefit
of, the holders of the Old VFG Certificates.

(d) The Continuing Corporation shall cause the New Certificates for shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which shares of FNB Common Stock and
VFG Common Stock, to the extent the Continuing Corporation elects to require
that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for New Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, are converted at the Effective Date or
dividends or distributions which such stockholder shall be entitled to receive
and any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares to be paid to such
stockholder upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old FNB Certificates and
Old VFG Certificates representing such shares of FNB and VFG, together with
the transmittal materials duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.3.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of FNB and VFG, to the extent the Continuing Corporation elects
to require that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for New
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, for six months after the
Effective Date shall be returned to the Continuing Corporation (together with
any dividends or earnings in respect thereof). Any stockholders of FNB and
VFG, if applicable, who have not complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter
be entitled to look only to the Continuing Corporation, and only as a general
creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of FNB Common Stock and VFG Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be liable to any stockholder of FNB or VFG
for any amount of property delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



 

4 2.3 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of FNB Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (after taking into account all Old FNB
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock multiplied
by the closing sale price of VFG Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date.

2.4 Dividends.

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of FNB
Common Stock or VFG Common Stock, to the extent the Continuing Corporation
elects to require that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for
New Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, at, or as of, any time
after the Effective Date will be paid to the holder of any Old FNB
Certificates or Old VFG Certificates, if applicable, until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate (or customary indemnity if any of such
certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed) for exchange as provided in Section
2.2 of this Agreement, promptly after which time all such dividends or
distributions will be paid (without interest).

2.5 FNB Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of FNB Common Stock (a "FNB Stock Option")
granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of FNB (a "FNB Stock
Plan"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to
represent a right to acquire FNB Common Stock and shall be converted at the
Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into an
option to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (a
"Continuing Corporation Stock Option") on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such FNB Stock Option (but taking into account
any changes thereto, including any acceleration thereof, provided for in the
relevant FNB Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason of the
Merger).

(b) The number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to
each such Continuing Corporation Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of FNB Common Stock subject to each such FNB Stock Option multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock, and such Continuing Corporation Stock
Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent)
equal to the per share exercise price specified in such FNB Stock Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided that the exercise price, the number of
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of each such option (after taking into
account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code.

(c) Each restricted stock award granted under a FNB Stock Plan (a "FNB Stock
Award") which is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date, shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any
rights with respect to shares of FNB Common Stock and shall be converted
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted
stock award of the Continuing Corporation (a "Continuing Corporation Stock
Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the FNB
Stock Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any
acceleration thereof, provided for in the FNB Stock Plan or in the related
award document by reason of the Merger). The number of shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock subject to each such Continuing Corporation Stock
Award shall be equal to the number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to
the FNB Stock Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock.

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the Continuing
Corporation will deliver to the holders of FNB Stock Options and FNB Stock
Awards any required notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to
the  



 

5  FNB Stock Plan and award documents and stating that such FNB Stock Options
and FNB Stock Awards have been assumed by the Continuing Corporation and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.5 after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms of the FNB Stock Plan).

(e) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation may maintain the
FNB Stock Plan for purposes of granting future awards. The provisions of the
FNB Stock Plan will be unchanged, except that (i) all stock options and other
equity-based awards issued by the Continuing Corporation pursuant to the FNB
Stock Plan following the Effective Date shall be stock options and equity-
based awards in respect of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, (ii) all
references to FNB (other than any references relating to a "change in control"
of FNB) in the FNB Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award
thereunder shall be deemed to refer to the Continuing Corporation, unless the
Continuing Corporation determines otherwise, and (iii) the number of shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock available for future issuance pursuant to
the FNB Stock Plan following the Effective Date (the "Available FNB Stock
Plan Shares") shall be equal to the number of shares of FNB Common Stock so
available immediately prior to the Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down to the nearest whole share of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock.

(f) The Continuing Corporation shall reserve for future issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the FNB Stock Options assumed by it in accordance with this
Section 2.5, plus the number of Available FNB Stock Plan Shares in the event
the Continuing Corporation maintains the FNB Stock Plan as contemplated by
Section 2.5(e). As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the
Continuing Corporation will file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock

existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same
shall expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in

coverage that do not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part
of it or its Subsidiaries.

regulatory accounting principles to provide for reasonably anticipated losses
on outstanding loans.

Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with all Environmental Laws (as

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties will use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable,
or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger
as promptly as practicable and shall cooperate fully with the other party
hereto to that end.



 

16 5.2 Access to Information; Notice of Certain Matters; Confidentiality.

(a) Each party will permit the other party to make or cause to be made such
investigation of its operational, financial and legal condition as the
other party reasonably requests; provided, that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the Merger and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. No investigation by a party shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other party.

(b) Each party will give prompt notice to the other party (and subsequently
keep the other party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of
the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance known that (i)
is reasonably likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to
it, or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

(c) Each party shall, and shall cause each of its directors, officers,
attorneys and advisors, to maintain the confidentiality of, and not use to the
detriment of the other party, all information obtained in such investigation
that is not otherwise publicly disclosed by the other party, unless use of
such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, such undertaking with respect to confidentiality to
survive any termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated,
each party shall promptly return to the furnishing party or, at the request of
the furnishing party, destroy and certify the destruction of all confidential
information received from the other party.

5.3 Stockholder Approvals.

(a) VFG shall call a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the VFG Stockholder
Approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of VFG shall
support and recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated therein shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the VFG
Stockholder Approval unless the Board has received and recommended (or
submitted to stockholders) a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.5.

Approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to

contemplated therein shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the FNB
Stockholder Approval unless the Board has received and recommended (or
submitted to stockholders) a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.5.

(c) VFG and FNB shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold their
respective stockholder meetings on the same day.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve either party of its
obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the
adoption thereof; provided, that neither party will be required to submit this
Agreement to its stockholders if doing so would not be permissible under
applicable law.

5.4 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement; SEC Filings.

(a) Each party will cooperate with the other party, and their representatives,
in the preparation of a registration statement on Form S-4 or
other appropriate form, including any pre-effective or post-effective
amendments or supplements thereto (the "Registration Statement"), to be filed
by VFG with the SEC in connection with the issuance of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock in the Merger, and the parties will prepare a joint proxy
statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of VFG and FNB
constituting a part thereof (the "Joint Proxy Statement"). Neither the Joint
Proxy Statement nor the Registration  



 

17  Statement shall be filed, and, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
no amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement shall be filed by VFG or FNB without consultation with
the other party and its counsel. VFG will use all reasonable efforts, in which
FNB will reasonably cooperate as necessary, to file the Registration
Statement, including the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form, with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable and to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof.

(b) Each party agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the times of the respective stockholder
meetings, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. Each party further agrees that if it
becomes aware that any information furnished by it that would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement.

5.5 No Other Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii)
furnish any confidential or nonpublic information relating to, or (iii) engage
or participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, an Acquisition
Transaction (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit either party, prior to its
respective meeting of stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 5.3, from
furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction with respect to such
party if, and only to the extent that (i) such partyÂ’s board of directors
concludes in good faith, after consultation with and based upon the written
advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law,
(ii) before taking such action, such party receives from such person or
entity an executed confidentiality agreement, and (iii) such partyÂ’s board of
directors concludes in good faith that the proposal regarding the Acquisition
Transaction constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal (as defined below). Each party shall immediately (within 24 hours)
notify the other party orally and in writing of its receipt of any such
proposal or inquiry, the material terms and conditions thereof, the identity
of the person making such proposal or inquiry, and will keep the other party
apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Transaction" means any of
the following transactions involving VFG or FNB, or their respective
Subsidiaries, other than as contemplated by this Agreement: (i) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than 10% of the consolidated assets of
the party; (ii) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 10% or
more of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or 10% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 10% of the consolidated assets of the party; or (iii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning 10% or more  



 

18  of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 10% of
the consolidated assets of the party.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
written proposal for an Acquisition Transaction that the Board of Directors
of VFG or FNB, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to consummation) (A) is more favorable to the stockholders of
VFG or FNB, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, than the
Merger and (B) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed
and reasonably likely to receive all required approvals of Governmental
Authorities (as defined below in Section 5.6(a)) on a timely basis and
otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed;
provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the
Acquisition Transaction shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 5.5(b), except the reference to "10% or more" in such definition
shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition
Transaction" shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving FNB or
VFG or one of their respective banking Subsidiaries.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall permit either party to terminate
this Agreement or affect any other obligation of the parties under this
Agreement.

5.6 Applications and Consents.

(a) The parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
prepare as promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings and
to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of each
Governmental Authority (as defined below) and all third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Regulatory
Approvals") and will make all necessary filings in respect of the Regulatory
Approvals as soon as practicable. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
"Governmental Authority" means any court, administrative agency or commission
or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or
any industry self-regulatory authority.

(b) Each party will promptly furnish to the other party copies of
applications filed with all Governmental Authorities and copies of written
communications received by such party from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party will consult
with the other party with respect to the obtaining of all Regulatory
Approvals and other material consents from third parties advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party
will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. All documents that the
parties or their respective Subsidiaries are responsible for filing with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including to obtain Regulatory Approvals) will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable law.

5.7 Public Announcements.

Prior to the Effective Date, the parties will consult with each other as to
the form and substance of any press release or other public statement
materially related to this Agreement prior to issuing such press release or
public statement or making any other public disclosure related thereto
(including any broad based employee communication that is reasonably likely
to become the subject of public disclosure); provided, that nothing in this
Section 5.7 shall prohibit any party from making any disclosure necessary in
order to satisfy such partyÂ’s disclosure obligations imposed by applicable
law or the rules established by the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other self-
regulatory organization.



 

19 5.8 Affiliate Agreements.

VFG has identified to FNB all persons who are, as of the date hereof,
directors or executive officers of VFG (the "VFG Affiliates"), and FNB
has identified to VFG all persons who are, as of the date hereof, directors
or executive officers of FNB (the "FNB Affiliates"). Each party will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a written agreement in the form of Exhibit
5.8 hereto to be delivered, on or prior to the date hereof to FNB from each
VFG Affiliate and to VFG from each FNB Affiliate, on or prior to the date
hereof.

5.9 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation at its election
shall either (i) provide generally to officers and employees of FNB and its
Subsidiaries, who at or after the Effective Time become employees of the
Continuing Corporation or its Subsidiaries ("FNB Continuing Employees"),
employee benefits under Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation, on terms and conditions which are the same as for similarly
situated officers and employees of the Continuing Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) maintain for the benefit of the FNB Continuing
Employees, the Benefit Plans maintained by FNB immediately prior to the
Effective Date; provided that the Continuing Corporation may amend any Benefit
Plan maintained by FNB immediately prior to the Effective Date to comply with
any law or as necessary and appropriate for other business reasons. Prior to
the Effective Date, VFG and FNB shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and
analyzing their respective Benefit Plans with a view towards developing
appropriate and effective Benefit Plans for employees of VFG and FNB and
their Subsidiaries after the Effective Date.

(b) For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual (except not
for purposes of benefit accrual with respect to any plan in which such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits) under the Continuing CorporationÂ’s
Benefit Plans, service with or credited by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be treated as service with the Continuing Corporation; provided that
this provision shall not cause VFGÂ’s tax-qualified defined benefit pension
plan (which is not open to new participants) to be opened to new participants
or to provide additional credit for pre-Effective Date service for benefit
accrual purposes. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation that cover the FNB Continuing Employees after the Effective Date
to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-existing conditions
that were excluded, or restrictions or limitations that were applicable,
under the Benefit Plans maintained by FNB), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the FNB Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by FNB to be credited to
such FNB Continuing Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the
Continuing Corporation, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such FNB Continuing
Employees under welfare Benefit Plans maintained by the Continuing
Corporation.

(c) Each employee of VFG or FNB, or one of their respective Subsidiaries, at
the Effective Date who is terminated by the Continuing Corporation after the
Effective Date, excluding any employee who has a contract providing for
severance, shall be entitled to severance pay in accordance with the
severance policy adopted prior to the Effective Date by the parties hereto,
if and to the extent that such employee is entitled to severance pay under
such policy. Such employeeÂ’s service with VFG or FNB shall be treated as
service with the Continuing Corporation for purposes of determining the
amount of severance pay, if any, under the Continuing CorporationÂ’s severance
policy.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be interpreted as preventing the
Continuing Corporation, from and after the Effective Date, from amending,
modifying or terminating any Benefit Plans maintained by either VFG or FNB or
their respective Subsidiaries or any other contracts, arrangements,
commitments or plans of either party in accordance with their terms and
applicable law.

5.11 Indemnification. 

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from
FNB, to the same extent and on the same conditions as such person is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to applicable law and FNBÂ’s Organizational
Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the extent legally
permitted to do so with respect to matters occurring on or before the
Effective Date. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which corporate
approval may be required to effectuate any indemnification, the Continuing
Corporation shall direct, if the party to be indemnified elects, that the
determination of permissibility of indemnification shall be made by
independent counsel mutually agreed upon between the Continuing Corporation
and the indemnified party. The Continuing Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain FNBÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability policy, or some other policy, including VFGÂ’s existing policy,
providing at least comparable coverage, covering persons who are currently
covered by such insurance of FNB for a period of six years after the Effective
Date on terms no less favorable to the directors and officers than those in
effect on the date hereof.

(b) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall be enforceable by each indemnified party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

5.12 Employment Arrangements.

(a) The Continuing Corporation will, as of and after the Effective Date,
assume and honor all employment agreements, severance agreements and
deferred compensation agreements that VFG and FNB and their respective
Subsidiaries have with their current and former officers and directors and
which are set forth in its Disclosure Letter, except to the extent any such
agreements shall be superseded on or after the Effective Date.

(b) The Continuing Corporation will enter into employment agreements, which
will become effective as of the Effective Date, with William P. Heath, Jr.,
O. R. Barham, Jr., Litz H. Van Dyke, Jeffrey W. Farrar, and Gregory W.
Feldmann in the form of Exhibit 5.12.

(c) Each party will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain appropriate
agreements and waivers from certain of its officers and its SubsidiariesÂ’
officers that the Merger will not constitute a change in control within the
meaning of their respective employment or change in control agreements.

5.13 Takeover Laws.

If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Stock Option Agreements, each party
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary (other than as contemplated
by Section 5.3) so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by
the Stock Option Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Stock Option Agreements.

5.14 Change of Method.

VFG and FNB shall be empowered, upon their mutual agreement and at any time
prior to the Effective Date, to change the method or structure of effecting
the combination of VFG and FNB (including the provisions of Article 1), if
and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or
desirable; provided  



 

21  that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or the
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock received by
FNB stockholders in exchange for each share of FNB Common Stock and VFG
stockholders in exchange for each share of VFG Common Stock, (ii) adversely
affect the tax treatment of FNBÂ’s stockholders or VFGÂ’s stockholders pursuant
to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the tax treatment of FNB or VFG
pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The
parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 8.3.

27 EXHIBIT 1.1(a)

To the Agreement and

Plan of Reorganization

PLAN OF MERGER

BETWEEN

FNB CORPORATION

AND

 

VIRGINIA FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

Pursuant to this Plan of Merger ("Plan of Merger"), FNB Corporation, a
Virginia corporation ("FNB"), shall merge with and into Virginia Financial
Group, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("VFG").

ARTICLE 1

Terms of the Merger 

1.1 The Merger.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of July 26, 2007, between FNB and VFG (the
"Agreement"), at the Effective Date, FNB shall be merged with and into VFG
(the "Merger") in accordance with the provisions of Virginia law and with the
effect specified in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
(the "Act"). VFG shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (VFG
as existing on and after the Effective Date is sometimes referred to herein
as the "Continuing Corporation"). The Merger shall become effective on such
date and time as may be determined in accordance with Section 1.2 of the
Agreement (the "Effective Date").

ARTICLE 2

Manner of Converting and Exchanging Shares

2.1 Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Shares. 

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the stockholders of FNB and VFG, as the case may be, such
stockholders will be entitled to the following:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of FNB ("FNB
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date
will be converted into and exchanged for 1.585 fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Continuing
Corporation ("Continuing Corporation Common Stock") pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Agreement and this Plan of Merger (the "Exchange
Ratio").

(b) All shares of FNB Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section 2.1
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date. Each certificate
previously representing any such shares (the "Old FNB Certificates") shall
cease to represent any rights except the right to receive with respect
to each underlying share of FNB Common Stock (i) a new certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
into which the shares of FNB Common Stock represented by the Old FNB
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 upon the
surrender of such Old FNB Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, (ii) in
accordance with Section 2.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Continuing
Corporation Common Stock, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of VFG ("VFG Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of  



 

A-1  Continuing Corporation Common Stock. Each certificate previously
representing shares of VFG Common Stock shall continue to represent an equal
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock on and after the
Effective Date.

(d) In the event VFG or FNB changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of shares of its common stock issued and outstanding
before the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction with respect to its outstanding common stock, and the record date
therefor shall be before the Effective Date, appropriate and proportional
adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

(e) Each share of FNB Common Stock held by either party and each share of VFG
Common Stock held by FNB or its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date (in
each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or on behalf of third
parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such
shares of VFG Common Stock shall resume the status of authorized and unissued
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a) At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by VFG and FNB
(in such capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
the Old FNB Certificates, certificates representing Continuing Corporation
Common Stock ("New Certificates"), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid hereunder in lieu
of fractional shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, without any
interest thereon (the "Exchange Fund"), to be paid pursuant to Article 1 and
this Article 2 in exchange for outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, the Continuing
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder
of record of FNB immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials
for use in exchanging such stockholderÂ’s Old FNB Certificates for New
Certificates based upon the Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) At its election, the Continuing Corporation may, but shall not be required
to, cause the Exchange Agent to send to each stockholder of record of VFG
immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use in
exchanging such stockholderÂ’s certificates representing shares of VFG Common
Stock ("Old VFG Certificates") for New Certificates representing an equal
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock. If the Continuing
Corporation elects to require the surrender of the Old VFG Certificates, it
shall comply with Section 2.2(a) above with respect to, and for the benefit
of, the holders of the Old VFG Certificates.

(d) The Continuing Corporation shall cause the New Certificates for shares of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which shares of FNB Common Stock and
VFG Common Stock, to the extent the Continuing Corporation elects to require
that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for New Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, are converted at the Effective Date or
dividends or distributions which such stockholder shall be entitled to receive
and any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares to be paid to such
stockholder upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old FNB Certificates and
Old VFG Certificates representing such shares of FNB and VFG, together with
the transmittal materials duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto. No interest will accrue or be paid on any such cash to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.3.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of FNB and VFG, to the extent the Continuing Corporation elects
to require that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for New
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, for six months after the
Effective Date shall be returned to the Continuing Corporation (together with
any dividends or earnings in respect thereof). Any stockholders of FNB  



 

A-2  and VFG, if applicable, who have not complied with this Article 2 shall
thereafter be entitled to look only to the Continuing Corporation, and only as
a general creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of FNB Common Stock and VFG Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon.

(f) None of the Exchange Agent, any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be liable to any stockholder of FNB or VFG
for any amount of property delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

2.3 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of FNB Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger
which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock (after taking into account all Old FNB
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock multiplied
by the closing sale price of VFG Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Date. 

2.4 Dividends.

No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of FNB
Common Stock or VFG Common Stock, to the extent the Continuing Corporation
elects to require that Old VFG Certificates be surrendered and exchanged for
New Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above, at, or as of, any time
after the Effective Date will be paid to the holder of any Old FNB
Certificates or Old VFG Certificates, if applicable, until such holder
physically surrenders such certificate (or customary indemnity if any of such
certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed) for exchange as provided in Section
2.2 of this Plan of Merger, promptly after which time all such dividends or
distributions will be paid (without interest).

2.5 FNB Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of FNB Common Stock (a "FNB Stock Option")
granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of FNB (a "FNB Stock
Plan"), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to
represent a right to acquire FNB Common Stock and shall be converted at the
Effective Date, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into an
option to purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (a
"Continuing Corporation Stock Option") on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such FNB Stock Option (but taking into account
any changes thereto, including any acceleration thereof, provided for in the
relevant FNB Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason of the
Merger).

(b) The number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to
each such Continuing Corporation Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of FNB Common Stock subject to each such FNB Stock Option multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock, and such Continuing Corporation Stock
Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest cent)
equal to the per share exercise price specified in such FNB Stock Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided that the exercise price, the number of
shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of such option (after taking into account
the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

(c) Each restricted stock award granted under a FNB Stock Plan (a "FNB Stock
Award") which is unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date, shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any
rights with respect to shares of FNB Common Stock and shall be converted
without any action on  



 

A-3  the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted stock award of the
Continuing Corporation (a "Continuing Corporation Stock Award"), on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the FNB Stock Awards (but
taking into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration thereof,
provided for in the FNB Stock Plan or in the related award document by reason
of the Merger). The number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock
subject to each such Continuing Corporation Stock Award shall be equal to the
number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to the FNB Stock Award multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Continuing Corporation Common Stock.

ARTICLE 3

The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date, as such of the Agreement and
as such Bylaws are to be amended as set forth in Exhibit 1.3(b) to the
