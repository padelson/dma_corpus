part of the holders of any securities of Merger Sub, Target or any
other Person:

  



  

### (a) Equity of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common

fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per
share, of the Surviving Company.

  



  

### (b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Any Target
Common Shares that are owned by Target as treasury stock, and any Target

share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, as hereinafter defined) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount (rounded to the nearest penny)
(the "Merger Consideration") equal to (i) the sum of (x) the Aggregate Paid

(ii) the Aggregate Fully Diluted Share Amount.

  

### 

  

### (d) Cancellation of Target Preferred Shares. Any Target Preferred Shares
that are owned by Target as treasury stock, any Target Preferred Shares that
are owned by Parent or Merger Sub, and any Target Preferred Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor

  



  

### (e) Effect of Conversion.

  



  

#### (i) Target Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, all of the
Target Common Shares converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
theretofore representing any such Target Common Shares (each a "Certificate")
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, with respect
thereto, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.2.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Target Preferred Shares. From and after the Effective Time, all of

each holder of a

  



        
   

  



  

#### certificate theretofore representing any such Target Preferred Shares
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

  



  

#### (iii) Limitation on Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the aggregate Merger Consideration which the
former holders of such shares of Target Common Stock shall have the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), plus the aggregate amount of the payments
to be made by Parent to holders of Stock Options pursuant to Section 2.4(a),
plus the aggregate amount of the payments to be made by Parent to option or
right holders under the Target ESPP pursuant to Section 2.4(c), shall not

## _Section 2.2_ Exchange of Certificates.

  



  

### (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
such exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Target (the "Exchange Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates representing Target Common Shares
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and non-
certificated Target Common Shares converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1 and represented by book entries ("Book Entry
Shares"), for the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall also be
responsible for paying the Stock Option Consideration and the
ESPP Consideration as contemplated in Section 2.4. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Target Stockholders, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be delivered in
respect of the Target Common Shares, plus cash sufficient to pay the Stock
Option Consideration and the ESPP Consideration (such aggregate amount being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement and in any event not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall agree
upon a final form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that (i)
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange
Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in
transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange,
a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States, that is a member
in good standing of the Securities Transfer AgentsÂ’ Medallion Program and
(ii) the signature thereof must be guaranteed by such a member or bank or
trust company in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature)
(the "Letter of Transmittal"), for use in effecting delivery of Target Common
Shares to the Exchange Agent and instructions related thereto (the
"Instructions"). Promptly after the Letter of Transmittal and Instructions
have been finalized, the Exchange Agent shall make the Letter of Transmittal
and Instructions available, upon request, to holders of Target Common Stock,
and promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each holder of record of Target Common Shares as of the Effective Time,
who has not previously submitted a properly completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal, the Letter of Transmittal and Instructions. Exchange
of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Exchange
AgentÂ’s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book
entry.

  

### 

  

### (b) Exchange Procedures. If a holder of Target Common Shares surrenders
to the Exchange Agent a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal
properly completed and

  



        
   

  



  

### duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested
pursuant to the Instructions, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and such holder is the record holder as of the Effective Time,
then the holder of such Certificate shall be paid on the Closing Date in
exchange therefor, by the Exchange Agent, solely from the Exchange Fund (to
the extent not terminated in accordance with Section 2.2(f)), or otherwise by
Parent in accordance with Section 2.2(f), the Merger Consideration (subject
to any applicable withholding tax as specified in Section 2.2(i)), without
interest, with respect thereto, and such Certificate shall forthwith be
canceled. If a holder surrenders to the Exchange Agent a Certificate,
together with a Letter of Transmittal properly completed and duly executed
(and such other documents as may be reasonably requested pursuant to the
Instructions), any time after two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, and such holder is the record holder as of the Effective Time, then the
holder of such Certificate shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date in exchange therefor by the Exchange Agent, solely
from the Exchange Fund (to the extent not terminated in accordance with
Section 2.2(f)), or otherwise by Parent in accordance with Section 2.2(f),
the Merger Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax as
specified in Section 2.2(i)), without interest, with respect thereto, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

### (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Target Common Shares upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Target Common Shares previously represented by such
Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Target
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of Target
Common Shares or Target Preferred Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates that evidenced ownership of Target Common Shares or Target
Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (d) Certificate Holder. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  

### 

  

### (e) No Further Ownership Rights in Target Common Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any Target Common Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Common Shares,
including any rights to receive declared but unpaid dividends with a record
date prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Target Common Shares for six (6)
months after the

  



        
   

  



  

### Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee), upon
demand, and any holder of Target Common Shares who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Target Common Shares as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and subject to the Surviving CompanyÂ’s obligation
in the preceding sentence, become the property of the Surviving Company free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

### (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct
obligations of the United States, (ii) obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either MoodyÂ’s Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and PoorÂ’s, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination
thereof; provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three (3) months from the date of the investment therein.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (i) Withholding Rights. Parent, Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Target Common Shares, any holder of Stock Options,
or any holder of options or rights issued pursuant to the Target ESPP,
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Code"), or under any other provision of applicable federal,
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent.

  

### 

  

### (j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such
Person of a bond, and in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such

  



        
   

  



  

### Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in accordance with Section 2.2
(except for the provisions thereof requiring delivery of such Certificate),
in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration with respect to each Target Common Share formerly represented
by such Certificate.

  



  

## _Section 2.3_ Appraisal Rights.

  

## 

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Target Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who
has delivered a written demand for appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1. At the Effective Time, all Target Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Dissenting
Stockholders ("Dissenting Shares") shall be canceled and cease to exist and
shall represent only the right to receive payment with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder who,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to
payment thereunder for such Dissenting Shares, shall receive payment therefor
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal under the DGCL, such Dissenting StockholderÂ’s
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been canceled and
ceased to exist and had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest on such amount,
with respect thereto. From and after the Effective Time, no holder of Target
Common Shares shall be entitled to vote its Target Common Shares for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on its
Target Common Shares.

  



  

## _Section 2.4_ Target Options, Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

  

## 

  

### (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in
any event no later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of Target (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Stock Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or use its reasonable best
efforts to take such other actions as are required to provide that each then
outstanding stock option to purchase Target Common Shares (a "Stock Option")
heretofore granted under any stock option or other stock-based incentive
plan, program or arrangement of Target (collectively, the "Stock Option
Plans") (other than the Target ESPP) shall be canceled, irrespective of any
vesting or other term or condition set forth in any grant, immediately prior
to the Effective Time in exchange for payment (subject to any applicable
withholding taxes) of an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Target Common Shares subject to and vested under (determined after
giving effect to any accelerating vesting provisions) such Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Stock Option
(the "Stock Option Consideration"). The Exchange Agent will make the
foregoing payments from the Exchange Fund to holders of Stock Options on, or
as soon as practicable following, the Effective Time. Such payments shall be
made pursuant to instructions provided by the Target.

  

### 

  

### (b) Target shall deliver written notice to each Registered Holder (as
defined in the Warrant Agreement) of Warrants at least ten (10) days prior to
the Effective Time that such Registered Holder shall have the option of (i)
exercising his, her or its Warrant prior to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Merger effective immediately upon exercise or (ii) exercising his, her or
its Warrant contingent upon the actual occurrence of the Merger. In the
event, a Registered Holder elects to exercise any part of his, her or its
Warrant in accordance with such notice, then such Warrant shall, either as of
the execution of the Exercise Agreement (as defined in the Warrant Agreement)
with respect to such exercise, or, if such exercise is contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be
converted into that number of Target Common Shares indicated in the Exercise
Agreement subject to the delivery of the applicable exercise price prior to
the Effective Time.

  



  

### (c) Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary to provide that the following shall occur, at or immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "Target ESPP-Related Events"): (i) each then
outstanding option or right to acquire Target Common Shares under TargetÂ’s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Target ESPP") shall automatically be
exercised or deemed exercised, and (ii) in lieu of Target Common Shares being
issued upon the exercise of each such option or right, the holder of such
option or right shall receive, from Parent, following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding tax) equal to the
product of (x) the number of Target Common Shares otherwise issuable upon
such exercise or deemed exercise and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such option or right (the
"ESPP Consideration") Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to
effectuate the Target ESPP-Related Events, including obtaining consents from
any optionee or right holder to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Section 2.4(c). Target (i) shall not permit the commencement of any
new offering period under the Target ESPP following the date hereof, (ii)
shall not permit any optionee or right holder to increase his or her rate of
contributions under the Target ESPP following the date hereof, and (iii)
shall terminate the Target ESPP as of the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent
will make the foregoing payments from the Exchange Fund to the applicable
Target ESPP participants on, or as soon as practicable following, the
Effective Time. Such payments shall be made pursuant to instructions provided
by Target.

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Effective Time, each Stock Option, each Warrant, and each
option or right issued by Target under the Target ESPP, shall be canceled and
shall cease to represent, or represent the right to purchase or acquire any
Target Common Shares, Target Preferred Shares or any other equity securities
of the Target, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective assets.

is first mailed to Target Stockholders and Parent and at the time of the
Target Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact

## _Section 3.17_ Opinion of Financial Advisors.

## _Section 3.19_ Insurance.

  

## 

  

Schedule 3.19 lists all material information (including nature of coverage,
limits, deductibles and premiums) pertaining to all policies or binders of
fire, casualty, liability, burglary, fidelity, workersÂ’ compensation,
vehicular, health, life and other insurance maintained, owned or held by
Target and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the "Insurance
Policies"). Such Insurance Policies provide such coverage for all of the
Target Owned Real Estate and all of the Target Leased Real Estate, including
all such coverages and limits of coverage, as is appropriate and customary
for the conduct of the Target and its SubsidiariesÂ’ business as currently
conducted and, to the Knowledge of Target, are in such amounts and insure
Target and its Subsidiaries against such losses and risks as are generally
maintained by comparable businesses. True, correct and complete copies of
such Insurance Policies have previously been delivered to Parent (including,
without limitation, copies of all written amendments, supplements and other
modifications thereto or waivers of rights thereunder). All of the Insurance
Policies are in full force and effect and are valid, outstanding and
enforceable, and all premiums with respect thereto are currently paid and no
basis exists for early termination of any of the Insurance Policies on the
part of the insurer thereunder, except where such failures to be in effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Target Material Adverse Effect. The coverage limits under the Insurance
Policies have not been exhausted or materially diminished. None of Target or
its Subsidiaries have failed to give any notice or present any claim under
any such Insurance Policies in due and timely fashion, and there are no
outstanding unpaid claims under any such Insurance Policies. None of the
Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
materially adverse manner) by reason of any of the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except where such terminations and lapses would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Target
Material Adverse Effect. No facts or circumstances exist which would relieve
the insurer under any Insurance

  



        
   

  



  

Policy of its obligation to satisfy in full any valid claim of the Target or
its Subsidiaries thereunder. Each of Target and its Subsidiaries has complied
with the material provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the
insured party, except where such failures to comply would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Target Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries have received any notice
of cancellation or non-renewal of any Insurance Policy. None of Target or its
Subsidiaries have been refused any insurance (including, without limitation,
insurance against loss due to terrorist acts) with respect to its assets,
properties or businesses, nor has any coverage been limited by an insurance
carrier to which any of Target or its Subsidiaries has applied for any such
insurance or with which Target or its Subsidiaries have carried insurance
during the last three years. Since January 1, 2004, no insurer under any
policy or binder of fire, casualty, liability, burglary, fidelity,
workersÂ’ compensation, vehicular, health, life and other insurance
maintained, owned or held by Target and its Subsidiaries at any time since
such date has cancelled or generally disclaimed liability under such policy
or binder or, to TargetÂ’s Knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to
renew any such policy.

of Target or any of its Subsidiaries has: (a) used any funds for unlawful

domestic governmental official or employee or to any foreign or
domestic political party or campaign or violated any provision of Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

## 

  

### (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), during the period beginning on the date of

Time"), Target shall not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) approve or

of Directors of Target to the Target Stockholders under applicable Law;
provided, however, that Target shall give Parent at least two (2) Business
DaysÂ’ written notice of its intention to take any such action and promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning Target or any

Proposal or its Representatives that was not previously provided to Parent.

manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, either (x) the approval,

Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the determination by such
Board of Directors or any such committee thereof that the Merger is in the
best interests of the Target Stockholders (an "Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to
recommend, adopt or approve, any alternative Acquisition Proposal, including
any Superior Proposal, or (ii) approve any acquisition agreement or similar
agreement (other than this Agreement) providing for an Acquisition Proposal

Directors of Target (I) in a situation not involving TargetÂ’s receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal, may take any of the actions set forth in clause (i)(A)
of this Section 5.3(c) if the Board of Directors of Target determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such actions would result in a breach of the fiduciary duty of the Board
of Directors of Target to Target Stockholders under applicable Law; or (II)
in the event of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, may take any of the
actions referred to in clause (i) of this Section 5.3(c) if (1) the Target
complies with its obligations under this Section 5.3, (2) such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (3) the Board of Directors of Target
determines in good faith, upon the advice of its outside counsel, that the
failure to take such actions would result in a breach of the fiduciary duty
of the Board of Directors of Target to Target Stockholders under applicable
Law, (4) the Target has provided Parent a least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of such proposal ("Superior Proposal Notice"), advising Parent
therein that the Board of Directors of Target has received a Superior
Proposal that it intends to accept, specifying therein the terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying therein the Person

  



        
   

  



  

### making such Superior Proposal, and (5) for a period of not less than five
(5) Business Days after ParentÂ’s receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice,

constitutes a Superior Proposal.

### (d) In addition to the obligations of Target set forth in subsections (a)

inquiry, and the identity of the Person making any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and the TargetÂ’s response or responses thereto. Target
shall keep Parent fully informed on a prompt and reasonably current basis as
to the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of
any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Target shall promptly
provide to Parent copies of all written correspondence or other written
material, including material in electronic written form, between Target and
any Person making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Upon the
execution of this Agreement, Target will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and

Agreement) shall prohibit Target from taking and disclosing to the
Target Stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to the Target Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of Target, after consultation with outside counsel and
upon receipt of the advice thereof, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings set for the below:

  

###

other than the Merger, (iv) any other acquisition or disposition
the consummation of which would essentially prevent the consummation of the
Merger, (v) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would

of equity securities of Target, or (vi) any public announcement by Target or

## _Section 5.8_ Indemnification and Insurance.

  

## 

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at
the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a member of the Board of Directors (or committee thereof) of Target or
a Subsidiary of Target, or a director or officer of Target or a Subsidiary
of Target (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees")
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in
the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as a member of the Board of Directors (or committee
thereof) of Target or a Subsidiary of Target, or as a director, officer,
employee or agent of Target or a Subsidiary of Target, or taken at the
request of Target or a Subsidiary of Target (including in connection with
serving at the request of Target or a Subsidiary of Target as a member of the
Board of Directors (or committee thereof) or director, officer, employee or
agent of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), at, or at any
time prior to, the Effective Time (including in connection with the Merger
and the other Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of Target and its Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided
in (A) the organizational documents of Target and its Subsidiaries as
currently in effect on the date of this Agreement and (B) the indemnification
agreements listed on Schedule 5.8, which shall survive the Merger and the
other Transactions and continue in full force and effect in

  



        
   

  



  

### accordance with their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving
Company to contain provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of members of the Board
of Directors (or committees thereof), directors, and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
organizational documents of Target, which provisions, to the extent permitted
by Law, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, advance funds for any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.8
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this Section 5.8) in advance of the final disposition of any
such claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation, as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
the extent it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 5.8 and to the extent required by
applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Surviving Company shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to assume and control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.8 (each, a
"Claim") with counsel selected by the Surviving Company, which counsel shall
be reasonably acceptable to the affected Indemnitee; provided, however, that
an Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim
at its own expense. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the Indemnitee
shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if there is a conflict of interest between the Surviving Company and any
Indemnitee with respect to the defense of any Claim (based on the written
opinion of counsel to such Indemnitee, which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Company), the Indemnitee shall be
permitted to participate in, and control, the defense of such Claim, but only
to the extent that it relates to the Indemnitee, with counsel selected by the
Indemnitee, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as accrued and in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Surviving Company shall not be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(in additional to any necessary local counsel) for all Indemnitees in any
single claim except to the extent that Indemnitees have conflicting interests
in the outcome of such Claim.

  



  

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement or a "tail" policy covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time
become) covered by TargetÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy as of the date of this Agreement, which shall provide such
directors and officers coverage for six (6) years following the Effective
Time on terms with respect to such coverage, and in an aggregate amount, not
less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the
date hereof; provided, however, that, if the aggregate cost for such
insurance

  



        
   

  



  

### exceeds $2.0 million (the "Premium Limit"), then, in lieu of the
foregoing extended reporting period endorsement or "tail" policy, Target
shall provide or cause to be provided an extended reporting period
endorsement or "tail" policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then be available for the Premium Limit; provided, further,
however, that, subject to the limitation set forth in the immediately
preceding proviso, at no time shall the aggregate amount of such coverage be
less than the aggregate amount of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance coverage then provided by Parent to its directors and officers.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless (x) such termination or modification
is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.8.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its consent.

  

### 

  

## _Section 5.9_ Fees and Expenses.

  

##

expenses, whether or not the Merger or the other Transactions are
consummated.

  



  

## _Section 5.10_ Rule 16b-3.

Merger by each individual who is a director or officer of Target to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that
certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding
such matters.

Closing Date, cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to provide
employees of Target and its Subsidiaries ("Target Employees") with employee
benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements (other than equity-based
compensation) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee
benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements provided by Target and
its Subsidiaries to Target Employees prior to the Closing Date Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries shall recognize the service of Target Employees
with Target prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries in connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k)
savings plan, welfare benefit plans and policies (including vacation and
holiday policies) maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries which is
made available to Target Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries for purposes of any waiting period, vesting,
eligibility and benefit entitlement thereunder (but excluding benefit
accruals under a defined benefit plan). Parent shall (i) waive, or use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, all
limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Target Employees
under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is
made available to Target Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries to the same extent required by comparable Target
Benefit Plans, and (ii) provide credit to Target Employees for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under
the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Target and its
Subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year including the

### 

  

### (b) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their terms, all
individual employment, retention, termination, severance, other similar
agreements, long term incentive plans, supplemental executive retirement
plans, deferral plans and any similar plans ("Executive Agreements") with any
Target Employee or maintained for the benefit of any Target Employee, as set
forth on Schedule 5.11(b), as such Executive Agreements may be amended, in

Time) to comply with Code Section 409A, other than the portions thereof that
relate to equity or equity-like benefits.

  

### 

  

### (c) Nothing in this Section 5.11, express or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Section 5.11.

### (a) The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Unless otherwise indicated herein, any statute defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including by
succession of comparable successor statutes. References to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise indicated herein,
any reference herein to a Schedule shall be to the corresponding Schedule of

### 

  

### (b) The parties hereto have participated collectively in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, it is the intention of the parties hereto
that this Agreement shall be construed as collectively drafted by the parties

### 

  

## _Section 8.13_ Guarantee.

  

## 

  

### (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(d), the Guarantor
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Target the
due and punctual observance, performance and discharge by the Parent of its
obligations under Section 7.3(c) of this Agreement (each, an
"Obligation" and, collectively, the "Obligations"). The Guarantor shall make
prompt payment (in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after
written demand by Target therefor) to Target for the amount of any such
Obligation.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Guarantor represents and warrants to Target that:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Guarantor is a limited partnership, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite power
and authority necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement, solely for the
purposes of this Section 8.13 (the "Guarantee"), and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Guarantor of the Guarantee have been approved by the requisite limited
partnership action, and no other action on the part of the Guarantor is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the
Guarantor of the Guarantee. The Guarantee has been duly executed
and delivered by the Guarantor and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the other parties to this Agreement,
constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor,
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Neither the execution and delivery of
the Guarantee by the Guarantor, nor compliance by it with any of the terms or
provisions of the

  



        
   

  



  

#### Guarantee, will (x) conflict with or violate any provision of
the organizational documents of the Guarantor, (y) violate any Law, judgment,
writ, stipulation or injunction of any Governmental Authority applicable to
the Guarantor, or (z) violate or constitute a default under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Guarantor is a
party.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform the
Obligations.

  

#### 

  

### (c) No failure on the part of Target to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by Target of any
right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any
right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted
to Target or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any other and may be exercised by Target at any time or from
time to time.
