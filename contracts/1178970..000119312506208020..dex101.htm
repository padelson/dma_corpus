Following the Closing, neither PFS, FMBT nor any of their affiliates shall
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act
could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code. PFS and FMBT each hereby agrees to deliver certificates
substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with
customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver
the legal opinions contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which certificates shall be
effective as of the date of such opinions.

__2.8. _Possible Alternative Structures._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX,
prior to the Effective Time PFS shall be entitled to revise the structure of
the Merger described in Section 2.1 hereof, provided that (i) such
modification does not cause counsel to be unable to render the opinions
contemplated by Section 9.1.6; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the
holders of FMBT Common Stock under this Agreement is not thereby changed in
kind, value or reduced in amount; and (iii) such modification will not delay
materially or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals or other
consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the Merger. The parties
hereto agree to appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents
in order to reflect any such revised structure.

__2.9. _Additional Actions._

If, at any time after the Effective Time, PFS or The Provident Bank shall
consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in PFS its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of FMBT, or (ii) otherwise carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, FMBT and its officers and directors shall
be deemed to have granted to PFS and The Provident Bank an irrevocable power
of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances
in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect
or confirm, of record or otherwise, in PFS or The Provident Bank its right,
title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of
FMBT or (b) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the
officers and directors of PFS and The Provident Bank are authorized in the
name of FMBT or otherwise to take any and all such action.

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

__3.1. _Conversion of FMBT Common Stock; Merger Consideration._

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of PFS and The Provident Bank, FMBT or the holders of any of the shares
of FMBT Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the
following terms:

3.1.1. Each share of PFS Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.



 

8 3.1.2. All shares of FMBT Common Stock held in the treasury of FMBT and each
share of FMBT Common Stock owned by PFS or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of PFS or of FMBT immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts
previously contracted) ("Treasury Stock"), shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor.

3.1.3. Each share of FMBT Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Stock and Dissenting
Shares) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive at the election
of the holder thereof as provided in Section 3.2 either (i) $39.75 in cash
(the "Cash Consideration"); or (ii) 2.1337 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
PFS Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). The Cash Consideration and the
Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as
the "Merger Consideration."

3.1.4. Each outstanding share of FMBT Common Stock the holder of which has
perfected his right to dissent under the New Jersey Banking Law and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the New Jersey Banking Law.
FMBT shall give PFS prompt notice upon receipt by FMBT of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of FMBT Common Stock and of
withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a "Dissenting Stockholder"), and PFS shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. FMBT shall not, except with the prior written consent of PFS,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting
Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the New
Jersey Banking Law. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall
be made by the Surviving Corporation.

3.1.5. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at
or prior to the Effective Time, such holders shares of FMBT Common Stock
shall be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his right to such payment after the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline,
as defined below), each share of FMBT Common Stock of such holder shall be
treated as a Non-Election Share.

3.1.6. After the Effective Time, shares of FMBT Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and shall thereafter by operation of this section be the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

3.1.7. In the event PFS changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of PFS Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend,



 

9 recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding PFS Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to
the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and
appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _that_ no such adjustment shall be made
with regard to PFS Common Stock if PFS issues additional shares of PFS Common
Stock and receives fair market value consideration for such shares.

__3.2. _Election Procedures. _

3.2.1. Holders of FMBT Common Stock may elect to receive shares of PFS Common
Stock or cash (in either case without interest) in exchange for their shares
of FMBT Common Stock in accordance with the following procedures, provided
that, in the aggregate, and subject to the provisions of Section 3.2.6, 50% of
the total number of shares of FMBT Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time, including any Dissenting Shares but excluding any Treasury
Stock (the "Stock Conversion Number"), shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of FMBT Common Stock shall
be converted into the Cash Consideration. Shares of FMBT Common Stock as to
which a Cash Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made
are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of FMBT Common
Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) are referred to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of FMBT
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an Election
Form is not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as "Non-
Election Shares." The aggregate number of shares of FMBT Common Stock with
respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as the
"Stock Election Number." Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash
Election Shares, and the holders thereof shall in no event receive
consideration comprised of PFS Common Stock with respect to such shares.

3.2.2. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as FMBT and PFS shall
mutually agree ("Election Form"), shall be mailed not less than 20 business
days but not more than 40 business days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time or on such earlier date as PFS and FMBT shall mutually agree (the
"Mailing Date") to each holder of record of FMBT Common Stock as of five
business days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").
Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject to the allocation and
election procedures set forth in this Section 3.2, (i) to elect to receive the
Cash Consideration for all of the shares of FMBT Common Stock held by such
holder (a "Cash Election"), in accordance with Section 3.1.3, (ii) to elect to
receive the Stock Consideration for all of such shares (a "Stock Election"),
in accordance with Section 3.1.3, (iii) elect to receive the Stock
Consideration for a part of such holders FMBT Common Stock and the Cash
Consideration for the remaining part of such holders FMBT Common Stock (the
"Cash/Stock Consideration") (an election to receive the Cash/Stock
Consideration is referred to as a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) to indicate that
such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or PFS Common
Stock for such shares (a "Non-Election"). A holder of record of shares of
FMBT Common Stock who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another
representative capacity (a "Representative") may submit multiple Election
Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the shares of FMBT
Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner.
Any shares of FMBT Common Stock with respect to which the



 

10 holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an election
by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed
Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. All Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed shares subject to a Cash Election, and with respect to such shares
the holders thereof shall in no event receive consideration comprised of PFS
Common Stock, subject to Section 3.1.5 hereof.

3.2.3. To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted
to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as PFS and FMBT
may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline"); provided, however, that the
Election Deadline may not occur on or after the Closing Date. FMBT shall make
available up to two separate Election Forms, or such additional Election
Forms as PFS may permit, to all persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of FMBT Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline. FMBT
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for
it to perform as specified herein. An election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates)
representing all shares of FMBT Common Stock covered by such Election Form,
together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election
Form. If an FMBT stockholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed
Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to
the Election Deadline, the shares of FMBT Common Stock held by such
stockholder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election Form may
be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of
revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior
to the Election Deadline. PFS shall cause the Certificate or Certificates
relating to any revoked Election Form to be promptly returned without charge
to the person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent
shall have discretion to determine when any election, modification or
revocation is received and whether any such election, modification or
revocation has been properly made.

3.2.4. If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.7
hereof, each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the
Stock Consideration only with respect to that number of Stock Election Shares
held by such holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which
is the Stock Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders
Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration.

3.2.5. If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted



 

11 into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares
and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 3.2.7 hereof,
each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election
Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration, and, subject to Section 3.2.7 hereof, each holder of Cash
Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1)
the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

3.2.6. Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, if the
aggregate value of the Stock Consideration to be delivered as of
the Effective Time less the amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
of PFS Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2.7 (the "Stock Value") is less than
42.5% of the sum of (i) the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration to
be delivered as of the Effective Time, plus (ii) the value of any
consideration described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(1)(ii),
plus (iii) cash paid to holders of Dissenting Shares, plus (iv) the value of
any consideration paid by PFS or any of its Subsidiaries (or any "related
person" to PFS or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) to acquire shares of FMBT Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time (such sum, the "Aggregate Value"), then PFS may
reduce the number of shares of outstanding FMBT Common Stock entitled to
receive the Cash Consideration and correspondingly increase the number of
shares of FMBT Common Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration by
the minimum amount necessary to cause the Stock Value to equal 42.5% of the
Aggregate Value.

3.2.7. _No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
PFS Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to PFS Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of PFS. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, PFS shall pay to each former holder of FMBT Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of PFS Common Stock,
an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent 



 

12 and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of
the daily closing sales prices of a share of PFS Common Stock as reported on
the NYSE for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all
shares of FMBT Common Stock owned by a FMBT stockholder shall be combined so
as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of PFS Common Stock
issuable to such FMBT stockholder.

__3.3. _Procedures for Exchange of FMBT Common Stock._

3.3.1. _PFS to Make Merger Consideration Available._ After the Election
Deadline and no later than the Closing Date, PFS shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
FMBT Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3,
certificates representing the shares of PFS Common Stock and an aggregate
amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant
to this Article III (including the estimated amount of cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of FMBT Common Stock) (such cash and certificates
for shares of PFS Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto (without any interest thereon) being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

3.3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. PFS shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates who has not
previously surrendered such certificates with an Election Form, a form letter
of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the FMBT Common
Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a result
of the Merger if any. The letter of transmittal (which shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of FMBT) shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration to which such holder of FMBT common stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.3 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash
Consideration or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. 

3.3.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
FMBT Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect
to such FMBT Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for
the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to PFS Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of PFS Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.



 

13 3.3.4. _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate
evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and
signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and
(ii) the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

3.3.5. _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FMBT of the FMBT Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

3.3.6. _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six (6)
month period after the Effective Time, PFS shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to PFS (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither PFS nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

3.3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by PFS, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as PFS may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

3.3.8.  _Withholding._ The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of FMBT Common Stock
such amounts as the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent



 

14 that such amounts are properly withheld by the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the FMBT Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by the Exchange Agent.

__3.4. _Reservation of Shares._

PFS shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the PFS
Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of PFS Common Stock to the FMBT
stockholders in accordance with this Article III.

any FMBT Subsidiary is a party or under which FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary may
be liable contains provisions which permit an employee or independent
contractor to terminate it without cause and continue to accrue future

the balance sheet contained in the most recent FMBT Financial Statements or
acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and
properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the
date of such balance sheet), subject to no material encumbrances, liens,
mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure
liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with,
borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities,
reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by an FMBT Subsidiary acting
in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet

Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of
real and personal properties used by FMBT and the FMBT Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to
lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and
financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental
commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as
disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the FMBT Financial
Statements.

4.10.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which FMBT or any
FMBT Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if
any, FMBT or such FMBT Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security
interest (which to FMBTs Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the

value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased.

Subsidiary of FMBT under such policies. All such insurance is valid and
enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years FMBT

coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies. FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3 identifies all policies of insurance

Except as described in FMBTs DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.18, all such transactions
(a) were made in the ordinary course of business, (b) were made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral,

or has been restructured, modified or extended except for rate modifications
pursuant to FMBTs loan modification policy that is applicable to all
Persons. Neither FMBT nor any FMBT Subsidiary has been notified that principal
and interest with respect to any such loan or other credit accommodation will

otherwise, which will survive the Effective Time by reason of any agreement
to register any transaction involving any of its securities under the
Securities Act.

4.22. _Risk Management Instruments._

 

All material interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for FMBTs own account, or for the account of one or more of
FMBTs Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth in FMBT
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.22), were in all material respects entered into
in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
policies, and to the Knowledge of FMBT and each FMBT Subsidiary, with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time; and to
FMBTs and each FMBT Subsidiarys Knowledge each of them constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of FMBT or such FMBT Subsidiary,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full
force and effect. Neither FMBT nor any FMBT Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge
of FMBT, any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under
any such agreement or arrangement in any material respect.

4.23. _Fairness Opinion._

FMBT has received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. to the effect
that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein,
as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the

from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or
rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

possesses valid and binding licenses and other rights to use all patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, servicemarks and trademarks used in
their business, each without payment, and neither FMBT nor any Significant
Subsidiary of FMBT has received any notice of conflict with respect thereto
that asserts the rights of others. FMBT and each Significant Subsidiary of
FMBT have performed all the obligations required to be performed, and are not
in default in any respect, under any contract, agreement, arrangement
or commitment relating to any of the foregoing.

4.25. _Trust Accounts_

FMBT and each of its Subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts for
which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for
which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of
the governing documents and applicable laws and regulations. Neither FMBT nor
any FMBT Subsidiary, and to their Knowledge, nor has any of their respective

Agreement, subject to obtaining the approvals set forth in Section 8.3.

5.11.3. For the period beginning January 1, 2005, and except as set forth in
PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.11.3, neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary

any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is material

or any PFS Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or
purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of PFS

"Regulatory Agreement"). Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has consented to
or entered into any currently effective Regulatory Agreement. The most recent

34 5.12. _Employee Benefit Plans._

5.12.1. PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.1 includes a list of all existing bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-
sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
severance, welfare benefit plans, fringe benefit plans, employment, severance
and change in control agreements and all other benefit practices, policies
and arrangements maintained by PFS or any PFS Subsidiary and in which
employees in general may participate (the "PFS Compensation and Benefit
Plans"). Each PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan has been administered in form
and in operation, in all material respects with its terms and all applicable
requirements of law and no notice has been issued by any Governmental
Authority questioning or challenging such compliance. With respect to each of
the PFS Compensation and Benefit Plans, if applicable, PFS has provided or
made available to FMBT copies of the most recent summary plan description (or
other such summary of the terms of the plan).

5.12.2. To the Knowledge of PFS and except as disclosed in PFS DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.12.2, each PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other
applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or
other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") _and_ which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received or has
requested and expects to receive a favorable determination letter from the
IRS, and PFS is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no
material pending or, to the Knowledge of PFS, threatened action, suit or claim
relating to any of the PFS Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine
claims for benefits). Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation
and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject PFS or any PFS
Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

5.12.3. No liability, other than PBGC premiums arising in the ordinary course
of business, has been or is expected by PFS or any of its Subsidiaries to be
incurred with respect to any PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a
defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA ("PFS Defined Benefit
Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by PFS or any entity which
is considered one employer with PFS under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred
to as an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). No PFS Defined Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer pension plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA. To the Knowledge of PFS, except as set forth in PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
5.12.3, no PFS Defined Benefit Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last
day of the end of the



 

35 most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof. Except as set forth in
PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.3, the fair market value of the assets of each
PFS Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the benefits guaranteed
under Section 4022 of ERISA under such PFS Defined Benefit Plan as of the end
of the most recent plan year with respect to the respective PFS Defined
Benefit Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such PFS
Defined Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and no notice of a "reportable
event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived has been required to be filed for any PFS
Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.
Neither PFS nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to
provide, security to any PFS Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has
taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a lien under Section
412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA. Neither PFS, its Subsidiaries, nor
any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after January 1, 1998. To the Knowledge of
PFS, there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by any Bank
Regulator with respect to any PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan or any ERISA
Affiliate Plan.

5.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
PFS Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements to which PFS or any PFS Subsidiary is a party or a
sponsor have been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding
obligations are accrued on PFSs consolidated financial statements to the
extent required by GAAP. PFS and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as
a liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes as required by
GAAP.

5.13. _Environmental Matters._

5.13.1. To the Knowledge of PFS, neither the conduct nor operation of their
business nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned
or operated by any of them (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or
agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a lien, results or resulted in
a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon PFS or
any PFS Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of PFS, no condition has existed or event
has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that, with
notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any
material liability to PFS or any PFS Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental
Laws. Neither PFS nor any PFS Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any Person that PFS or any PFS Subsidiary or the operation or condition of
any property ever owned, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary
capacity by any of them are currently in violation of or otherwise are alleged
to have financial exposure under any Environmental Laws or relating to
Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to,
responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or
originating from any such property) for which a material liability is
reasonably likely to be imposed upon PFS or any PFS Subsidiary.



 

36 5.13.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the PFSs

governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary.

6.2.2. FMBT and The Provident Bank shall meet on a regular basis to discuss
and plan for the conversion of FMBTs data processing and related electronic

Effective Time. In the event that FMBT takes, at the request of The Provident
Bank, any action relative to third parties to facilitate the conversion that
results in the imposition of any termination fees or charges, The Provident
Bank shall indemnify First Morris Bank and Trust for any such fees and
charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process, if for any reason
the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach of this
Agreement by FMBT, or a termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1.8 or
11.1.9.

6.2.3. FMBT shall provide PFS, within fifteen (15) business days of the end
of each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the term

Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled
Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned, (iv)
all loans ninety (90) days or more past due) as of the end of such month and

loan type and other material features of the loan.

6.2.4. FMBT shall promptly inform PFS upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary under any
labor or employment law.

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records._

Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, FMBT shall permit PFS reasonable access upon
reasonable notice to its properties and those of the FMBT Subsidiaries, and
shall disclose and make available to PFS during normal business hours all of
its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties, operations,
obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of
account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter FMBT reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and stockholders meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which PFS may have a
reasonable interest; provided, however, that FMBT shall not be required to
take any action that would provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure, in FMBTs reasonable judgment, would interfere with
the normal conduct of FMBTs business or would violate or prejudice the
rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other person or
would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel. FMBT shall provide and shall request its
auditors to provide PFS with such historical financial information regarding
it (and related audit reports and consents) as PFS may reasonably request for
securities disclosure purposes. PFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with FMBTs regular business operations during
any such access to FMBTs property, books and records. FMBT and each FMBT
Subsidiary shall permit PFS, at its expense, to cause a "phase I environmental
audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at any physical
location owned or occupied by FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary.



 

44 6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, FMBT will furnish to PFS copies of each
annual, interim or special audit of the books of FMBT and the
FMBT Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and copies of all

Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations,
without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current
financial reporting practices.

of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of FMBT or

financial data that FMBT possesses and as PFS may reasonably
request, including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements
and loan reports.

such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary
in relation to the character and location of its properties and the nature of
its business

6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, FMBT will promptly supplement
or amend the FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith
with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct
any information in such FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such FMBT
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

FMBT shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each FMBT
Subsidiary to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any
other persons necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions

foregoing, FMBT shall utilize the services of a professional proxy soliciting
firm to provide assistance in obtaining the stockholder vote required to
be obtained by it hereunder.



 

45 6.8. _All Reasonable Efforts._

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, FMBT agrees to use, and
agrees to cause FMBT Subsidiaries to use, all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

In the event that FMBT determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify PFS.

6.10. _No Solicitation._

From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither FMBT, nor any FMBT Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, agents and affiliates (including,
without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
FMBT or any of the FMBT Subsidiaries), will, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions
or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an
Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, or employees or any of its
Subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by any of its Subsidiaries to take any such
action, and FMBT shall notify PFS orally (within one business day) and in
writing (as promptly as practicable) of all of the relevant details relating
to all inquiries and proposals which it or any of its Subsidiaries or any
such officer, director or employee, or, to FMBTs Knowledge, investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative of
FMBT may receive relating to any of such matters,  _provided, however_ , that
nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of FMBT from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal or
state law; or (ii) furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of FMBT
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors), taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal and the Person making the proposal, that such proposal, if
consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable
to FMBTs stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger; (B)
the Board of Directors of FMBT determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors) that the failure to furnish information
to or enter into discussions with such Person would likely cause the Board of
Directors to breach its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law
(such proposal that satisfies clauses (A) and (B) being referred to herein as
a "Superior Proposal"); (C) FMBT promptly notifies PFS of such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with FMBT
or any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries,



 

46 proposals or offers, and receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement in form and substance identical in all material respects to the
confidentiality agreements that FMBT and PFS entered into; and (D) the FMBT
Stockholders Meeting has not occurred. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer as to any of the
following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder) involving FMBT
or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, or other similar transactions; (ii) any sale, lease,
exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of
the assets of FMBT and the FMBT Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single
transaction or series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange
offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of FMBT or
the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

6.11. _Reserves and Merger-Related Costs._

On or before the Effective Time, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, the
rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and
regulations, FMBT shall establish such additional accruals and reserves as
may be necessary to conform the accounting reserve practices and methods
(including credit loss practices and methods) of FMBT to those of PFS (as such
practices and methods are to be applied to FMBT from and after the Closing
Date) and PFSs plans with respect to the conduct of the business of FMBT
following the Merger and otherwise to reflect Merger-related expenses and
costs incurred by FMBT, provided, however, that FMBT shall not be required to
take such action unless PFS agrees in writing that all conditions to closing
set forth in Article IX have been satisfied or waived (except for the
expiration of any applicable waiting periods). No action shall be required
to be taken by FMBT pursuant to this Section 6.11 if, in the opinion of
FMBTs independent auditors, such action would contravene GAAP.

COVENANTS OF PFS

7.1. _Conduct of Business._

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective

each PFS Subsidiary to: conduct its business only in the usual, regular and

(ii) adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements
under this Agreement; (iii) result in the representations and warranties
contained in Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the

or in any of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being
satisfied; (iv) change or waive any provision of its Certificate of

47 7.2. _Financial and Other Statements._

As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date such
documents are filed with the SEC, PFS will deliver to FMBT the

Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of PFS or any of the PFS
Subsidiaries.

 

7.3. _Disclosure Supplements._

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, PFS will promptly supplement
or amend the PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any
information in such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to such PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall
have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article IX.

7.4. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

PFS and The Provident Bank shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other
Persons necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, PFS agrees to use and
agrees to cause The Provident Bank to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

7.6.  _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

In the event that PFS or The Provident Bank determines that a condition to its
obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not
waive that condition, it will promptly notify FMBT.

7.7. _Employee Benefits; Advisory Board._

7.7.1 In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided
by FMBT are changed or terminated by PFS, in whole or in part, PFS shall
provide Continuing Employees (as defined below in Section 7.7.5) with
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to
the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated



 

48 PFS employees (as of the date any such compensation or benefit is provided).
Subject to the terms of this Section 7.7.1, its is agreed that all Continuing
Employees shall become eligible to participate in any applicable PFS
Compensation and Benefit Plans as soon as practicable following the Closing.
All FMBT Employees who become participants in an PFS Compensation and Benefit
Plan shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any applicable
vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual
purposes) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements in
such plans for service as an employee of FMBT prior to the Effective Time,
provided, however, that Continuing Employees will enter PFSs tax-qualified
employee plans on the applicable entry dates set forth in said
plan documents, and provided further, that credit for prior service shall not
be given under the PFS retiree health plan. This Agreement shall not be
construed to limit the ability of PFS or The Provident Bank to terminate the
employment of any employee or to review employee benefits programs from time
to time and to make such changes as they deem appropriate.

7.7.2 Prior to the Effective Time, FMBT shall amend the change in control
agreements listed on FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.13 to terminate each such
agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time and to distribute as of the
Effective Time to each executive who is a party to said agreement an amount
equal to 2.0 of such persons "base amount" as defined in the change in
control agreements, except Brian Giovanazzi, who will receive 2.999 of his
"base amount" as defined in Section 280G of the Code. At the time of payment
of the amounts set forth above, each officer or employee receiving payment
thereunder shall enter into an acknowledgment and release, satisfactory in
form to PFS, acknowledging that no further payments are due under such
sections and releasing FMBT, PFS and The Provident Bank and their respective
officers, directors and employees from any and all claims arising thereunder.

7.7.3 In the event an FMBT employee (i) is not offered employment with PFS at
a rate of compensation no less than provided by FMBT or is offered employment
with PFS but is terminated by PFS (other than a termination for cause) within
one year of the Effective Time or (ii) is not offered employment with PFS at a
place of business within 20 miles from such persons place of employment as of
the date of this Agreement or is subsequently relocated to such place of
employment (although this Section 7.7.3(ii) shall not apply if the place of
business is the PFS Loan Center in Woodbridge, New Jersey), PFS shall pay, or
in the event of a termination prior to or at the Effective Time, FMBT shall
pay if requested by PFS, a severance benefit pursuant to the terms of The
Provident Bank Severance Policy for Employees without Contracts for Reduction
in Force of Job Elimination in an amount which would cause such benefits to
not be considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A; provided,
however, that the persons listed on FMBT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.7.3 shall be
considered "Senior Management" for purposes of such plan.

7.7.4 At the Closing, PFS and Brian Giovinazzi shall enter into the non-
compete agreement attached as PFS DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.7.4.

7.7.5 In the event of any termination of any FMBT health plan or consolidation
of any such plan with any PFS or The Provident Bank health plan, PFS
shall make available to employees of FMBT who continue employment with PFS or
a PFS Subsidiary ("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-
provided health coverage on the same basis as it



 

49 provides such coverage to PFS employees. Unless a Continuing Employee
affirmatively terminates coverage under a FMBT health plan prior to the time
that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in the PFS
health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the FMBT health plans prior to
the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees
of PFS and their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of
any FMBT health plan, terminated FMBT employees and qualified beneficiaries
will have the right to continued coverage under group health plans of PFS in
accordance with Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with the provisions below.
In the event of any termination of any FMBT health plan, or consolidation of
any FMBT health plan with any PFS health plan, any coverage limitation under
the PFS health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the
PFS health plan to the degree that such condition was covered by the FMBT
health plan and such condition would otherwise have been covered by the PFS
health plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. All FMBT Employees who
cease participating in an FMBT health plan and become participants in a
comparable PFS health plan shall receive credit for any co-payment and
deductibles paid under FMBTs health plan for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the PFS health
plan, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to PFS that such co-payment
and/or deductible has been satisfied.

7.7.6 Effective as of the Closing Date, PFS shall establish the Morris
County, New Jersey Advisory Board (the "Advisory Board"). Each person who
serves on the Board of Directors of FMBT (except for the director who may join
the PFS Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement) both on
the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be appointed to the Advisory Board effective immediately following the
Effective Time. The Advisory Board shall meet quarterly, and each advisory
board member shall receive an annual advisory board fee of $24,000. The
Advisory Board shall be continued for a period of at least two years.

7.8. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

7.8.1. PFS shall maintain, or shall cause The Provident Bank to maintain, in
effect for six years following the Effective Time, the current directors and
officers liability insurance policies maintained by FMBT (provided, that PFS
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no
event shall PFS be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.9.1 more
than 200% of the annual cost currently expended by FMBT with respect to such
insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided, further,_ that if the amount of
the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Amount, PFS shall maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, FMBT agrees in order
for PFS to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers liability
insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or substitute insurer
with such representations as such insurer may request with respect to the
reporting of any prior claims.



 

50 7.8.2. In addition to Section 7.8.1, for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, PFS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes
before the Effective Time, an officer or director of FMBT or an FMBT
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior
written consent of PFS, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each
a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a
party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of
the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of FMBT or
a FMBT Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware (to the extent not prohibited by federal law), PFSs
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and under FMBTs Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws. PFS shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware (to the extent not prohibited by federal
law) upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if the
Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 7.8.2 upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify PFS (but the failure so to notify PFS shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this Section 7.8.2, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices PFS) and shall deliver to PFS
the undertaking referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any
such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) PFS shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such
assumption PFS shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if PFS
elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are or may be (whether
or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest
between PFS and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and PFS shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the
extent otherwise required due to conflicts of interest, PFS shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties whose reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid promptly
as statements are received unless there is a conflict of interest that
necessitates more than one law firm, (3) PFS shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (4) no Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a matter
as to which (x) he shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary, or (y) in the
event that a proceeding is compromised or settled so as to impose any
liability or obligation upon an Indemnified Party, if there is a
determination that with respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did not
act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of FMBT or any FMBT Subsidiary. Such
determination shall be made in accordance with the New Jersey Banking Laws.



 

51 7.8.3. In the event that either PFS or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of PFS shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.8.

7.8.4. The obligations of PFS provided under this Section 7.8 are intended to
be enforceable against PFS directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of PFS. PFS shall
pay all reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, as incurred and in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.8 to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law; however such payment of costs should be
immediately reimbursed to PFS by such Indemnified Party if they are not
successful enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this
Section 7.8. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under applicable
law.

__7.9. _Stock Listing._

PFS agrees to list on the NYSE (or such other national securities exchange on
which the shares of the PFS Common Stock shall be listed as of the Closing
Date), subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of PFS Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger.

__7.10. _Stock and Cash Reserve._

PFS agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of PFS Common Stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or borrowing
capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

REGULATORY AND OTHER MATTERS

__8.1. _Meeting of Stockholders._

FMBT will (i) as promptly as practicable after the Merger Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC, take all steps necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which
may be an annual meeting, for the purpose of considering this Agreement and
the Merger, and for such other purposes as may be, in FMBTs reasonable
judgment, necessary or desirable (the "FMBT Stockholders Meeting"), (ii) in
connection with the solicitation of proxies with respect to the FMBT
Stockholders Meeting, have its Board of Directors recommend approval of this
Agreement to the FMBT stockholders; and (iii) cooperate and consult with PFS
with respect to each of the foregoing matters.



 

52 __8.2. _Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Merger Registration Statement._

8.2.1. For the purposes (x) of registering PFS Common Stock to be offered to
holders of FMBT Common Stock in connection with the Merger with the SEC under
the Securities Act and (y) of holding the FMBT Stockholders Meeting, PFS shall
draft and prepare, and FMBT shall cooperate in the preparation of, the Merger
Registration Statement, including a proxy statement and prospectus satisfying
all applicable requirements of applicable state securities and banking laws,
and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed by FMBT to the
FMBT stockholders, together with any and all amendments or supplements
thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). PFS
shall provide FMBT and its counsel with appropriate opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to the time it is initially
filed with the SEC or any amendments are filed with the SEC. PFS shall file
the Merger Registration Statement, including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus,
with the SEC. Each of PFS and FMBT shall use their best efforts to have the
Merger Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and FMBT shall thereafter promptly
mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its stockholders. PFS shall also use
its best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and FMBT shall furnish all information concerning FMBT and

8.2.2. PFS shall, as soon as is practicable, file the Merger Registration
Statement with the SEC under the Securities Act in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that time
is of the essence in connection with the preparation and filing of the Merger
Registration Statement. PFS will advise FMBT promptly after PFS receives
notice of the time when the Merger Registration Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order or the suspension of the qualifications of the shares of PFS Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement, or the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request
by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Merger Registration
Statement, or for additional information, and PFS will provide FMBT with as
many copies of such Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto
promptly upon the filing thereof as FMBT may reasonably request.

8.2.3. FMBT and PFS shall promptly notify the other party if at any time it
becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger Registration
Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, FMBT shall cooperate with PFS in the
preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus
that corrects such misstatement or omission, and PFS shall file an amended
Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and FMBT shall mail a Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to FMBTs stockholders.



 

53 __8.3. _Regulatory Approvals._

Each of FMBT and PFS will cooperate with the other and use all reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare and, within 60 days after the date hereof or as
soon thereafter as practicable, file all necessary documentation to obtain
all necessary permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of the
FRB, FDIC and the Department and any other third parties and governmental
bodies necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. FMBT and PFS will furnish each other and each others counsel with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, petition or other statement made by or on
behalf of FMBT or PFS to any Bank Regulator or governmental body in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each party acknowledges that time is of the essence in connection with the
preparation and filing of the documentation referred to above. FMBT shall have
the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to FMBT and any of its Subsidiaries which appear in any
filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with any governmental body. In addition, FMBT and PFS shall each furnish to
the other for review a copy of each such filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any governmental body prior
to its filing.

__8.4. _Affiliates._

8.4.1. FMBT shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each director,
executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule
145 under the Securities Act) of FMBT to deliver to PFS, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date of the FMBT Stockholders Meeting, a written agreement, in
the form of Exhibit B hereto, providing that such person will not sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of PFS Common Stock to be

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of FMBT:

11.1.1. At any time by the mutual written agreement of PFS and FMBT;

11.1.2. By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the

notice of such breach by the terminating party to the other party; provided,
however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1.2 unless the breach of representation or
warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating
party not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section
9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by FMBT) or
Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by
PFS);

11.1.6. By either party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank Regulator

11.1.7. By the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the

58 into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal. After
providing such notice, FMBT shall provide a reasonable opportunity to PFS
during the five-day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable FMBT to proceed with the Merger

11.1.10 By FMBT, if its Board of Directors so determines by a majority vote of
the members of its entire Board, at any time during the five business-
day period commencing on the Determination Date if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(i) The PFS Market Value on the Determination Date is less than $15.37,
adjusted as indicated on the last sentence of this Section 11.1.10; and

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the PFS Market Value on the Determination
Date by the Initial PFS Market Value ("PFS Ratio") shall be less than the
quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial
Index Price, minus 0.175;

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If FMBT elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to PFS. During the five business day period commencing
with its receipt of such notice, PFS shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of FMBT Common Stock who elect to
receive PFS Common Stock hereunder by adjusting the Exchange Ratio to one of
the following quotients at its sole discretion: (i) a quotient, the numerator
of which is equal to the product of the Initial PFS Market Value, the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio minus 0.175, and the
denominator of which is equal to PFS Market Value on the Determination Date;
or (ii) the quotient determined by dividing the Initial PFS Market Value by
the PFS Market Value on the Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient
by the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and .825. If PFS so
elects, it shall give, within such five business-day period, written notice to
FMBT of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1.10
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this Section 11.1.10, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

"Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation, or any
similar transaction, involving the relevant companies, (ii) a purchase, lease
or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant
companies, (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the relevant companies; or (iv) an agreement or
commitment by the relevant companies to take any action referenced above.

"Determination Date" shall mean the first date on which all Regulatory
Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation of
the Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period).



 

59 "Final Index Price" means the sum of the Final Prices for each company
comprising the Index Group multiplied by the weighting set forth opposite
such companys name in the definition of Index Group below.

"Final Price," with respect to any company belonging to the Index Group,
means the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of common stock
of such company (and if there is no closing sales price on any such day, then

exchange on which such common stock is principally traded, for the twenty
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

"Index Group" means the financial institution holding companies listed below,
the common stock of all of which shall be publicly traded and as to which

stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or an Acquisition
Proposal for such company to be acquired, or for such company to acquire
another company in a transaction with a value exceeding 25% of the acquirors
market capitalization based on the table below, is announced at any time
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the

exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement
and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company
