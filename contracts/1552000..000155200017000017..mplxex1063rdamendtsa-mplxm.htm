generally-accepted industrial standards, MPC's then current vetting program or
applicable Laws, and Terminal Owner fails to correct any deficiency identified
by MPC to MPC's satisfaction within 30 days of being notified of such
deficiency, MPC may terminate this Agreement as to such non-compliant
Terminal. MPC shall provide a copy of its then current vetting procedures to
Terminal Owner upon Terminal Owner's written request.

3.12 Public Use. This Agreement is made as an accommodation to MPC. In no
event shall Services provided by Terminal Owner be deemed to be those of a
public utility or a common carrier. If any action is taken or threatened by
any Governmental Authority to declare the Services provided by Terminal Owner
hereunder to be those of a public utility or a common carrier, in that event,
at the option of the Terminal Owner and upon MPC's receipt of Terminal Owner's
notice, Terminal Owner and MPC shall negotiate in good faith to restructure
and restate this Agreement or, in the event the Parties are unable to reach an
agreement following such good faith efforts, Terminal Owner may terminate this
Agreement on the effective date of such action as to any affected Terminal or
Services.

3.13 MPC Third Party Contracts. MPC may contract with third Persons for the
provision of Services up to, but not exceeding, the Reserved Capacity (any
such contract, a "MPC Third Party Contract") and Terminal Owner shall provide
such Services as directed by MPC.

3.14 Services at Newly Acquired Terminals. Terminal Owner and its Affiliates
may not offer or enter into any agreement with any Person other than MPC with
respect to Services in connection with any terminal that is subsequently
acquired by Terminal Owner or its Affiliates without first offering to MPC the
opportunity to procure such Services at such subsequently acquired terminal
from Terminal Owner; provided, however, this Section 3.14 shall not apply to
any offer made or agreement entered into or assumed as a part of and
concurrently with the closing of such terminal acquisition. If MPC indicates
its intent to exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 3.14 within 20 days
of receipt of Terminal Owner's written notice, the Parties shall modify
Schedule 3.1 and Schedule 5.1 as appropriate to reflect any additional
Terminals, new Reserved Capacity, new or modified Minimum Quarterly Terminal
Volume Commitment and new or modified Fees. If MPC waives or fails to indicate
its intent to exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 3.14 within 20 days
of receipt of Terminal Owner's written notice, Terminal Owner may, for the
next 90 days, proceed with negotiations and enter into an agreement with any
third Person with respect to the provision of Services in connection with such
subsequently acquired terminal. If no such contract with a third Person is
consummated during such 90 day period, the terms and



conditions of this Section 3.14 shall again become effective as to procurement
of Services at such subsequently acquired terminal.



ARTICLE 4

MINIMUM VOLUME COMMITMENTS

4.1 Quarterly Volume Commitment.

(a) Commitment. During each Calendar Quarter, MPC shall tender the respective
volumes of Products identified by Calendar Quarter for each Terminal in
Schedule 3.1 (each a "Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitment") for
redelivery (including transshipments but excluding Transmix) at each Terminal.

(b) Third Party Throughput Credit. If a third Person throughputs volumes
pursuant to a MPC Third Party Contract at the Terminals during any Calendar
Quarter, such volumes shall be applied to the applicable Minimum Quarterly
Terminal Volume Commitment for each such Terminal.

4.2 Partial Period Proration. If this Agreement is terminated on any day other
than the last day of a Calendar Quarter, then any calculation determined with
respect to a Calendar Quarter will be prorated by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in that part of the Calendar Quarter ending on the
date of such termination and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the Calendar Quarter. If this Agreement is terminated on any day other than
March 31, then any calculation determined with respect to a full year (April 1
through March 31) will be prorated by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in that part of the year ending on the date of such
termination and the denominator of which is the number of days in such year.

4.3 Special Provisions Relating to Minimum Volume Commitments.

(a) Force Majeure Events. At the conclusion of a Force Majeure event lasting
longer than 7 days, the applicable Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitments at affected Terminals with respect to each Calendar Quarter in
which the suspension due to the Force Majeure event remained in effect at such
Terminals shall be ratably reduced to reflect such suspension; provided,
however, that in the event of a Force Majeure event affecting MPC and not
Terminal Owner (a "MPC Force Majeure") such ratable reduction of the
applicable Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments shall be limited to
the lesser of (i) the actual ratable reduction or (ii) a 5% reduction for the
duration of such MPC Force Majeure.

(b) Action by Governmental Authorities and Landowners. If Terminal Owner's use
of all or part of a Terminal for the provision of Services is restrained,
enjoined, restricted or terminated by any Governmental Authority, any right of
eminent domain or the owner of leased land (in each case, other than a Force
Majeure event), Terminal Owner, upon being notified of such restraint,
enjoinder, restriction or termination, shall notify MPC and the applicable
Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments shall be proportionately reduced
to the extent that Terminal Owner's use of the applicable Terminal is so
restrained, enjoined, restricted or terminated.



(c) Other Loss of Available Capacity. If, for any reason not otherwise covered
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) or Section 4.3(b), the average daily capacity of a
Terminal for any Service provided during a given Calendar Quarter is less than
the applicable Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments for such Calendar
Quarter, or if the capacity of a Terminal for any Service is required to be
allocated among third Persons with the result that the average daily capacity
of the Terminal available for any Service during a given Calendar Quarter is
less than the applicable Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments for
such Calendar Quarter, then such Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments
for the applicable Calendar Quarter shall be reduced to equal the average
daily capacity available to MPC during such Calendar Quarter.

(d) Prospective Volume Adjustment Opportunity.

(i) Commencing with the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date and continuing
every five years under the Term thereafter (each such date, an "Adjustment
Opportunity Date"), Terminal Owner shall provide a statement to MPC, along
with reasonable supporting documentation, showing (A) the Terminals or
Terminal Complexes for which a Terminal Deficiency Payment was made during the
previous five year period; (B) the average actual volumes of Products tendered
for redelivery (including transshipments but excluding Transmix) at each such
Terminal or Terminal Complex, as applicable, on a Calendar Quarter basis; and
(C) a calculation showing the percentage decrease of the volumes calculated in
Section 4.3(d)(i)(B) ("x") versus the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitments or Aggregate Committed Complex Volume, as applicable ("y"), such
calculation being expressed mathematically as (x-y)/y.

(ii) If the percentage reduction calculated for any such Terminal or Terminal
Complex, as applicable, in Section 4.3(d)(i)(C) is equal to or greater than
25%, then MPC, at its option, may require Terminal Owner to negotiate in good
faith, a reasonable reduction in the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitments for such Terminals not to exceed the percentage reduction
determined in Section 4.3(d)(i)(C); provided, however, that if MPC requires
Terminal Owner to negotiate a volume adjustment pursuant to this Section,
Terminal Owner may require MPC to negotiate in good faith (A) a reasonable
reduction in the Reserved Capacity for such Terminals not to exceed the
percentage difference determined in Section 4.3(d)(i)(C), and (B) a reasonable
increase in the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitments at Terminals
where the average actual volumes of Products tendered for redelivery
(including transshipments but excluding Transmix) at each such Terminal on a
Calendar Quarter basis exceeds the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitments by 25% or more for the same previous five year period.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) Terminal Owner shall have no right to
seek the volume adjustment described in the proviso of Section 4.3(d)(ii)
unless it first agrees with MPC to a reduction of the Minimum Quarterly
Terminal Volume Commitment with respect to the applicable Adjustment
Opportunity Date, and (B) any adjustment to a Minimum Quarterly Terminal
Volume Commitment made pursuant to this Section shall be applied only
prospectively from the Adjustment Opportunity Date and shall not be further
adjusted (unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties pursuant to a valid
amendment hereunder) until the next Adjustment Opportunity Date.



4.4 Reserved Capacity.



(a) Reserved Capacity. At a minimum, the full throughput capacity at each
Terminal (the "Reserved Capacity" of such Terminal) and the lanes, docks and
shell capacities set forth on Schedule 3.1 supporting the Reserved Capacity at
each Terminal (collectively, the "RC Assets") as may be adjusted pursuant to
this Agreement, shall be kept operational by Terminal Owner during the Term.
Prior to making or allowing any reduction to the RC Assets for each Terminal
set forth on Schedule 3.1, Terminal Owner shall meet with MPC, negotiate in
good faith with respect to any reduction in Fees hereunder and obtain MPC's
written consent to such changes in Reserved Capacity.

(b) Exclusivity. The Reserved Capacity shall be allocated to MPC and the Fees
reflect MPC's right hereunder to the exclusive use of such Reserved Capacity.

(c) MPC Non-Participation in Terminal Projects. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if MPC declines participation in a Terminal Project which
increases the throughput capacity at any Terminal and Terminal Owner elects to
proceed with such Terminal Project without reimbursement from MPC pursuant to
Section 5.5(a), such increased throughput capacity shall be excluded from the
Reserved Capacity and Terminal Owner may enter into one or more agreements
with third Persons in respect of such throughput capacity.

(d) Terminal Owner Third Party Contracts. Terminal Owner shall not make any
commitments to third Persons that would interfere with MPC's ability to
utilize the Reserved Capacity, except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this
Agreement or consented to in advance by MPC, which consent may be conditioned
or withheld in MPC's sole discretion. If MPC provides such consent, Terminal
Owner may enter into one or more agreements with third Persons in respect of
utilization of such Terminal capacity (that, absent such consent, would
otherwise be Reserved Capacity) and the Reserved Capacity shall be accordingly
reduced at such Terminal and Schedule 3.1 shall be modified by the Parties
accordingly.

ARTICLE 5

COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT

5.1 Fees. In consideration of the Reserved Capacity and the Services performed
by Terminal Owner hereunder, MPC shall pay Terminal Owner the following fees
(collectively, the "Fees"):

(a) Base Throughput Fee. The base throughput fee for each corresponding
Terminal set forth on Schedule 5.1 (each a "Base Throughput Fee") shall apply
to volumes of MPC's Products (excluding Transmix) redelivered hereunder up to
the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitment. The Base Throughput Fee
shall be charged on a per Gallon basis measured at the redelivery point and,
except for the Marine Docks, butane blending, ethanol denaturing, and Unit
Train Ethanol Receipts, is inclusive of all Services provided hereunder,
including additization, renewable fuel blending and Transmix handling.

(b) Excess Throughput Fee. For volume of MPC's Products (excluding Transmix)
redelivered hereunder in excess of the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitment, the excess throughput fee for each corresponding Terminal set
forth on Schedule 5.1 (each an "Excess Throughput Fee") shall apply. The
Excess Throughput Fee shall be charged on a



per Gallon basis measured at the redelivery point and, except for the Marine
Docks, butane blending, ethanol denaturing, and Unit Train Ethanol Receipts,
is inclusive of all Services provided hereunder, including additization,
renewable fuel blending and Transmix handling.

(c) Marine Docks. With respect to the Marine Docks, the Fees shall also
include a Monthly facility fee set forth on Schedule 5.1 for the exclusive
suite of Services typically applicable to marine dock facilities and provided
at the Marine Docks. Such facility fees for the Marine Docks shall be payable
by MPC on a Monthly basis during the Term, regardless of the actual volumes of
Products throughput by or on behalf of MPC at such Marine Docks.

(d) Butane Blending. The fees for butane blending Services provided by
Terminal Owner to MPC or its designated customers hereunder shall be
calculated and charged as set forth on Schedule 5.1.

(e) Ethanol Denaturing. The fees for ethanol denaturing Services provided by
Terminal Owner hereunder shall be calculated and charged as set forth on
Schedule 5.1.

(f) Deficiency.

(i) Quarterly Deficiency. If MPC fails to meet any of its Minimum Quarterly
Terminal Volume Commitments during any Calendar Quarter, then MPC will pay
Terminal Owner a deficiency payment (each, a "Terminal Deficiency Payment")
equal to the volume in Gallons of the Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume
Commitment deficiency multiplied by the applicable Base Throughput Fee for the
affected Terminal; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein including the fact that MPC failed to meet a Minimum Quarterly
Terminal Volume Commitment for a particular Terminal during a Calendar
Quarter, (A) MPC shall not be liable for payment of any Terminal Deficiency
Payment if (1) such Terminal is included in a Terminal Complex; and (2) the
applicable Aggregate Actual Complex Volume for the applicable Calendar Quarter
meets or exceeds the Aggregate Committed Complex Volume for such Calendar
Quarter; and (B) if, with respect to any Terminal Complex, the Aggregate
Committed Complex Volume for such Calendar Quarter exceeds the Aggregate
Actual Complex Volume for such Calendar Quarter, the Terminal Deficiency
Payment for each Terminal included in such Terminal Complex which failed to
meet its Minimum Quarterly Terminal Volume Commitment will be an amount equal
to the product of: (1) the volume in Gallons of the Minimum Quarterly Terminal
Volume Commitment deficiency for such Terminal divided by the sum of the
differences between the volume in Gallons of the Minimum Quarterly Terminal
Volume Commitment and the actual volume of Products in Gallons tendered for
redelivery at each of the Terminals in such Terminal Complex that experienced
a deficiency during such Calendar Quarter, (2) multiplied by the difference by
which the Aggregate Committed Complex Volume for such Calendar Quarter exceeds
the Aggregate Actual Complex Volume for such Calendar Quarter, and (3)
multiplied by the applicable Base Throughput Fee for such Terminal.

(ii) Quarterly True-Up. Promptly following each Calendar Quarter, Terminal
Owner shall provide MPC a written statement showing the Quarterly Aggregate
Volume Commitment versus the Actual Quarterly Aggregate Volume. If the Actual
Quarterly Aggregate Volume exceeds the Quarterly Aggregate Volume Commitment,
MPC shall not owe and shall be relieved from payment to Terminal Owner of any
Terminal Deficiency Payments determined pursuant to Section 5.1(f)(i) for the
applicable Calendar Quarter.



(iii) Exclusive Remedy. Section 5.1(f) sets forth Terminal Owner's sole and
exclusive remedy for MPC's failure to meet any of its Minimum Quarterly
Terminal Volume Commitments or, if applicable, Aggregate Committed Complex
Volumes, during any applicable Calendar Quarter.

(g) Unit Train Ethanol Receipts. The fees for Services provided by Terminal
Owner to MPC to support Unit Train Ethanol Receipts shall be calculated and
charged as set forth on Schedule 5.1.

5.2 Taxes. The Fees are exclusive of any and all inspection fees, sales taxes,
consumer excise taxes, or any other taxes of any Governmental Authority and
other charges which may be levied, assessed or due upon the Services provided
by Terminal Owner, except for taxes based on or measured by Terminal Owner's
income, gross receipts or net worth (collectively "Taxes"). MPC shall render
payment of Taxes due and payable directly to the taxing Governmental
Authority, unless such Taxes are collected and remitted to the taxing
Governmental Authority by Terminal Owner, in which case, such Taxes shall be
passed through to MPC, and identified as Taxes on the Monthly invoice. MPC
shall provide any applicable tax exemption certificates to Terminal Owner for
purposes of the collection and remittance of Taxes under this Agreement. Each
Party is responsible for all Taxes in respect of its own real and personal
property.

5.3 Adjustments. As of January 1, 2017, and as of January 1 of each year
thereafter during the Term, Terminal Owner shall upwardly adjust each of the
Fees (excluding fees for Unit Train Ethanol Receipts) annually by two percent
(2%).

5.4 Invoices; Payment. Terminal Owner shall furnish MPC a Monthly invoice
setting forth the total Fees and separately stating each of the Taxes payable
with respect to Services performed hereunder during the preceding calendar
Month and any other amounts due, including, as applicable, any quarterly
Terminal Deficiency Payments. Any credits due MPC pursuant to Schedule 5.1,
Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.2 and charges for VRU Gains pursuant to Section
7.3 shall also be reflected on the invoice for the month in which the
applicable credit, losses or VRU Gains occurred. MPC shall pay such invoice
within 10 days of the date of receipt thereof.

5.5 Terminal Projects.

(a) Terminal Projects. With respect to any Terminal, (i) Terminal Owner may
propose projects to MPC which expand, modify, debottleneck or otherwise
enhance the capacity of the Terminal or ability of Terminal Owner to provide
Services to MPC; and (ii) MPC may request Terminal Owner to complete projects,
including tank switches or other reconfigurations of the Terminals on behalf
of MPC (in each case of subparts (i) and (ii), a "Terminal Project"). Terminal
Projects will be identified and agreed upon by both Parties prior to the
conceptual or feasibility phase of such Terminal Project. If Terminal Owner
and MPC agree to undertake a Terminal Project, MPC shall reimburse Terminal
Owner upon completion or termination of such Terminal Project or, at Terminal
Owner's option, and if the Parties agree, any applicable Fees will be
increased, or additional fees shall be added to Schedule 5.1, or an alternate
mechanism shall be adopted to allow Terminal Owner to recover expenditures
relating to the Terminal Project over time (each, a "Project Reimbursement
Method.") The terms agreed upon by the Parties with respect to the applicable
Terminal Project and the Project Reimbursement Method shall be memorialized in
an agreement known as the "Project and Services Recovery Agreement" and shall
be signed by



Authorized Representatives of each Party. If a Terminal Project increases or
reduces the RC Assets at a particular Terminal as shown on Schedule 3.1 of
this Agreement, the Parties shall, at the written request of either Party,
execute one or more amendments, including without limitation, Schedule 3.1 and
Schedule 5.1 of this Agreement, to reflect said change.

(b) Regulatory Projects. If, after the Effective Date, Terminal Owner incurs
increased costs in operations or is required to make modifications to its
Terminals in connection with new or amended Laws, such modifications known as
"Regulatory Projects," MPC shall reimburse Terminal Owner, in each case, for
MPC's proportionate share of such costs or, at Terminal Owner's option, and if
the Parties agree, the Parties will select a Project Reimbursement Method to
allow Terminal Owner to recover such costs over time. The terms agreed upon by
the Parties with respect to any Regulatory Projects and the Project
Reimbursement Method associated therewith shall be memorialized in a Project
and Services Recovery Agreement and shall be signed by Authorized
Representatives of each Party. If Regulatory Projects completed pursuant to
this Section 5.5(b) increase or reduce the RC Assets at a particular Terminal
as shown on Schedule 3.1 of this Agreement, the Parties shall, at the written
request of either Party, execute one or more amendments, including without
limitation, Schedule 3.1 and Schedule 5.1 of this Agreement, to reflect said
change.

5.6 Audit. Terminal Owner will retain its books and records related to the
charges to MPC for Services provided hereunder for a period of at least 2
years from the date the Services are invoiced to MPC. MPC may audit such books
and records at Terminal Owner's offices where such books and records are
stored upon not less than 21 days' prior written notice. Any such audit will
be at MPC's sole expense and will take place during Terminal Owner's business
hours.

ARTICLE 6

TITLE AND CUSTODY

6.1 Title. Title to all Products delivered by MPC to Terminal Owner hereunder
shall be and remain in the name of MPC and Terminal Owner acknowledges it has
no title to or interest in said Products. Terminal Owner shall not create,
incur or suffer to exist any pledge, security interest, lien, levy, or other
encumbrance of or upon any such Products and will make all payments when due,
the nonpayment of which might result in the imposition of such lien or levy on
the Products; provided, however, that Terminal Owner shall not be required to
make any payments on behalf of MPC. If any such lien or levy does attach to
the Products, Terminal Owner shall promptly make all payments or, at its
option, take such other action necessary or prudent in its discretion to
obtain the release and discharge of same.

6.2 Custody.

(a) Custody of Receipts. Custody of all Products received by Terminal Owner at
the Terminal via (i) truck or rail shall pass to Terminal Owner when such
Products pass the last permanent flange connection between the delivering
truck's or railcar's unloading assembly and the receiving pipeline at the
Terminal; (ii) a connecting pipeline shall pass to Terminal Owner when such
Products pass the flange connection between the delivering pipeline and the
intake manifold of the Terminal; and (iii) marine vessel shall pass to
Terminal Owner as such Products pass the off-



loading arm flange connection between the marine vessel and the Terminal's
receiving hose, dock connection or pipeline.

(b) Custody of Redeliveries. Custody of all Products redelivered to MPC or its
customers from the Terminal via: (i) truck or rail shall pass back to MPC or
its customer, as applicable, when such Products pass the connection between
the Terminal's loading arm and the receiving truck or railcar; (ii) a
connecting pipeline shall pass back to MPC or its customer when such Products
pass the discharge flange connection at the demarcation point between the
discharge manifold of the Terminal and the receiving pipeline and (iii) marine
vessel shall pass back to MPC or its customer when such Products pass the
connection between the Terminal's discharge hose, dock connection or pipeline
and the marine vessel's loading arm.

6.3 Tank Heels. A portion of MPC's Product inventory at the Terminals shall be
allocated to tank heels and not be available for delivery. The portion of
MPC's Product inventory allocated to tank heels shall be calculated on an
annual basis for each Product at the Terminals separately for MPC and, if
designated by MPC, MPC's customers, according to the following formula: (the
average minimum total available storage space at the Terminal for MPC and its
designated customers divided by the Total Storage Space) multiplied by the
Total Tank Heels. The tank heels for the Terminals shall be returned to MPC or
its customers, as applicable, at the end of the Term and may be pulled by MPC
or its customers, as applicable, at any time within 120 days of the end of the
Term.

ARTICLE 7

PRODUCT LOSSES, GAINS AND DOWNGRADES

7.1 Ordinary Handling Losses.

(a) Evaporation, Clingage, Shrinkage and Line Losses. Terminal Owner
anticipates that in the normal course of its handling, storage and transport,
as applicable, of MPC's Products, there will be evaporation, clingage,
shrinkage, and line losses ("Ordinary Handling Losses"). As such, MPC
acknowledges that the quantity of Products it delivers to the Terminals may
differ from the amount actually redelivered by Terminal Owner from the
Terminals.

(b) MPC Responsibility. MPC shall be responsible, and Terminal Owner may make
adjustments, for such quantity differences to reflect Ordinary Handling Losses
of MPC's Products up to 0.25% of the total volume of MPC's Products
redelivered by Terminal Owner each Month.

(c) Terminal Owner Responsibility. Subject to Section 7.2, Section 7.5 and
MPC's reasonable confirmation of Terminal Owner's probable responsibility
following a duly conducted investigation of the Ordinary Handling Losses,
Terminal Owner shall be responsible for quantity differences to reflect
Ordinary Handling Losses of MPC's Products in excess of 0.25% of the volume of
MPC's Products redelivered by Terminal Owner across all of the Terminals each
Month. Any such Ordinary Handling Losses shall be settled and reflected as a
credit to MPC on the invoice for such Month in an amount equal to the Gallons
of Ordinary Handling Losses in excess of 0.25% of the volume of MPC's Products
redelivered by Terminal Owner each Month multiplied by the appropriate market-
based pricing formula set forth on Schedule 7.1 (each, a "Market Price



Formula"). This Section 7.1(c) sets forth MPC's sole and exclusive remedy for
Ordinary Handling Losses.

7.2 Extraordinary Losses and Downgrades. Excluding losses of Products which
are Ordinary Handling Losses subject to Section 7.1, Terminal Owner shall be
responsible for downgraded, damaged, lost, or destroyed Products (each, a
"Product Incident") that exceed one-hundred (100) barrels per Product
Incident, but only to the extent such Product Incident is caused by the
negligence, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Terminal Owner in the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement (the "Extraordinary
Losses"). Any such Extraordinary Losses shall be promptly self-reported in
writing by Terminal Owner to MPC and thereafter settled and reflected as a
credit to MPC on the invoice for such Month in an amount equal to, as
applicable, (a) the decrease in value of the downgraded Product, or (b) the
Gallons of Extraordinary Losses multiplied by the appropriate Market Price
Formula for the Terminal in question as agreed to by the Parties. Terminal
Owner shall account for the volume of Product downgraded or lost, and MPC's
inventory of Products and interface shall be appropriately adjusted. This
Section 7.2 sets forth MPC's sole and exclusive remedy for Extraordinary
Losses.

7.3 Gains.

(a) Vapor Recovery Unit Gains. Each Month, Terminal Owner shall calculate the
Gallons of gains in MPC's Products resulting from use of vapor recovery units
at each Terminal in accordance with the formula set forth on Schedule 7.3(a)
(the "VRU Gains"). MPC shall retain any such VRU Gains for each Month in its
inventory; provided, that, Terminal Owner's invoice to MPC for such Month
shall include a charge for such VRU Gains in an amount equal to the Gallons of
VRU Gains multiplied by the appropriate Market Price Formula for the Terminal
in question as agreed to by the Parties.

(b) Other Gains. Excluding VRU Gains, all gains of MPC's Products by Terminal
Owner each Month at a Terminal shall belong to MPC.

7.4 Loss and Gain Reconciliation. Terminal Owner shall reconcile the balance
of MPC's Product gains and losses, including VRU Gains, Ordinary Handling
Losses and Extraordinary Losses, at the end of each Month and adjust MPC's
inventory based on such reconciliation. The Product gain or loss shall be
prorated by the total volume MPC throughputs at each Terminal versus the total
volume of Products throughput at such Terminal during such Month.

7.5 Transmix. Interface volume ("Transmix") received shall be allocated among
MPC and other customers receiving Products generating such Transmix in the
same shipment or stored in commingled storage in proportion to each customer's
volume of Products in such shipment or storage. MPC shall remove its Transmix
upon notice from Terminal Owner and shall be subject to additional Transmix
handling fees upon its removal. If Transmix is not removed within 15 days
after notification (such time period to be extended to the extent of any delay
of hindrance by Terminal Owner, its agents or contractors for any reason),
Terminal Owner shall have the right to sell such Transmix at market rates and
return any proceeds to MPC, less applicable Transmix handling fees in effect
at the time of such sale.





ARTICLE 8

PRODUCT QUALITY

8.1 Quality. MPC shall not deliver, or cause to be delivered, any Non-
Conforming Product into storage in any Terminal. In the event the Parties
disagree as to the existence or extent of a failure of Product received from
or redelivered to MPC to meet Product specifications provided by the
applicable connecting pipeline operator and the specifications for such
Products as determined by applicable Law, samples shall be taken and referred
to an independent inspection laboratory or MPC's Research and Analytical
Development laboratory, as is mutually agreeable to both Parties for analysis
and any necessary investigation. The inspector's fee for services rendered and
all other expenses incurred by either Party in connection with such inspection
and investigation shall be borne equally by Terminal Owner and MPC.

8.2 Environmental Fuels Requirements; Oversight Programs. The Parties shall
establish an oversight program in compliance with applicable Laws which
program, at a minimum, shall allow the applicable Party to satisfy an
affirmative defense to presumptive liability under the RVP program, the
gasoline sulfur program, the ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel program, the RFG
program, or the gasoline-ethanol blend requirements for Products which are
subject to such programs. Gasoline-ethanol blend oversight shall include
regular checks to reconcile volumes of ethanol in inventory and regular checks
of equipment for proper ethanol blend rates. To the extent Terminal Owner
provides Services involving RFG or RBOB, it shall conduct, or cause to be
conducted, periodic sampling and testing of representative RFG or RBOB for
oxygen, benzene, RVP (summer only) or volatile organic compound emission
performance. Each Party and its Affiliates shall be entitled to utilize any of
the information obtained from such oversight program as if it were such
Party's own information. To the extent Terminal Owner provides Services
involving different levels of RVP Product during the summer RVP season,
Terminal Owner shall maintain a program to ensure that a recipient of Product
for a specified low RVP destination is locked out from access to non-
conforming high RVP Product. Non-destination specific loading cards shall not
carry such Product restrictions. To the extent Terminal Owner provides
Services involving both RFG and conventional at a Terminal, Terminal Owner
shall maintain a program to ensure that a recipient obtaining Product for a
specified RFG destination shall be locked out from access to conventional
gasoline. Non-destination specific loading cards shall not have such product
restrictions. The Parties shall retain copies of all PTDs and all oversight
program results as required by applicable Law. MPC shall be responsible for
procuring, at its sole expense, any third-party (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, MPC's refining organization) sampling and testing services pursuant
to this Section 8.2.

8.3 Non-Conforming Products. MPC shall be liable for all reasonable costs and
losses of Terminal Owner in curing, removing, or recovering any Non-Conforming
Products, except to the extent that such non-conformity is due to the
negligence or willful misconduct of Terminal Owner (in which event, the
provisions of Section 7.2 shall govern Terminal Owner's liability with respect
to such costs and losses). Terminal Owner, with the advance written consent of
MPC (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
may attempt to blend the Non-Conforming Products, remove and dispose of the
Non-Conforming Products or, if necessary, recover any Non-Conforming Products
from Terminals and, except to the extent that such non-conformity is due to
the negligence or willful misconduct of Terminal Owner, MPC shall reimburse
Terminal Owner for all reasonable costs associated therewith. Except to the
extent that a non-



conformity is due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Terminal Owner,
if MPC's Non-Conforming Products cause any contamination, dilution or other
damages to Terminal Owner or to the Products of other customers of Terminal
Owner, MPC agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Terminal Owner harmless from
and against any Claims pursuant to the indemnity obligations and limitations
set forth in Article 10. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
cure, removal or recovery of Non-Conforming Products shall be performed in
conformance with Law.

ARTICLE 9

ENVIRONMENTAL

9.1 Environmental Pollution. MPC shall comply with all requirements of Law,
and shall not subject Terminal Owner to any liability, obligations, claims,
judgments, penalties, fines, costs or expenses, in either case arising out of
or relating to air, surface or subsurface soil, or water pollution.

9.2 Spill Response. Except for breaches of MPC's covenant set forth in Section
9.1, in the event of any Product spills or other environmental releases or
discharges from a Terminal or arising from the operations of a Terminal,
cleanup and any resulting liability for such spills or discharges shall be the
sole responsibility of Terminal Owner. In the event of any Product spills or
other environmental releases or discharges caused by MPC or its customer or
carrier, Terminal Owner may, and MPC hereby authorizes Terminal Owner to,
commence containment, clean-up and disposal operations as deemed appropriate
or necessary by Terminal Owner or as required by any Governmental Authorities.
The Parties shall cooperate for the purpose of obtaining reimbursement if a
third Person is legally responsible for costs or expenses associated with any
Product spills initially borne by Terminal Owner or MPC.

9.3 Emergency Notification. Both Parties shall undertake to notify the other
as soon as reasonably practical, but in no event more than 24 hours, after
becoming aware of any accident, spill or incident involving the other Party's
employees, agents, contractors, sub-contractors or their equipment, or MPC's
Products at a Terminal and to provide reasonable assistance in investigating
the circumstances of the accident, spill or incident. Notices required by this
Section 9.3 shall be delivered in person, by telephone or by email. When an
accident, spill or incident involving MPC's Products requires a report to be
submitted to a Governmental Authority, this notification shall be made as soon
as reasonably practical in compliance with applicable Law, and a copy of the
required report shall be delivered to MPC.

9.4 Marine Vessel Vetting. MPC shall have procedures in place to ensure that
all marine vessels accepted to call at any marine dock at a Terminal,
including the Marine Docks, meet the minimum standards of safe operation
established by Terminal Owner. Terminal Owner shall advise MPC of specific
requirements applicable to each such Marine Dock.

ARTICLE 10

INDEMNITY

10.1 Indemnification by MPC. MPC will protect, defend, indemnify and hold
Terminal Owner harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, causes
of action,



liabilities, losses, reasonable attorneys' fees or costs (collectively, the
"Claims") arising out of, resulting from, incident to, or in connection with
(a) MPC's breach of this Agreement; or (b) the acts or omissions of MPC or
Terminal Owner, their respective employees, agents or subcontractors, or MPC's
third party authorized carriers or customers, except to the extent such Claims
are caused by the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of Terminal
Owner, its employees, agents or subcontractors.

10.2 Indemnification by Terminal Owner. Terminal Owner shall protect, defend,
indemnify and hold MPC harmless from and against any and all Claims arising
out of, resulting from, incident to, or in connection with (a) Terminal
Owner's breach of this Agreement; or (b) the negligent or intentional acts or
omissions of Terminal Owner, its employees, agents or subcontractors.

10.3 Survival. Any indemnification granted in this Article 10 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement until all applicable statutes of limitation
have run regarding any Claims that could be made with respect to the
activities contemplated by this Agreement.

10.4 Consequential Damages. In no event will either Party be liable to the
other Party for special, indirect, consequential (including loss of profits),
or punitive damages resulting from or arising out of this Agreement,
regardless of cause.

10.5 Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
each Party shall be discharged from any and all liability with respect to
Services performed and any loss or damage Claims arising out of this Agreement
unless suit or action is commenced with respect to such Services or Claims
within 2 years after the applicable cause of action arises.

ARTICLE 11

INSURANCE.

11.1 Insurance. Insurance for MPC's Products, if any, that may be desired by
MPC shall be carried by MPC at MPC's expense. Should MPC elect to carry
insurance, then without prejudice to MPC's rights to directly assert self-
insured claims for losses, each policy of insurance shall be endorsed to
provide a waiver of subrogation rights against Terminal Owner and its
Affiliates to the extent of the liabilities and obligations assumed by MPC
under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

FORCE MAJEURE

12.1 Force Majeure. As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure
event, a Party affected by such Force Majeure event shall provide the other
Party written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure event. Subject to
Section 4.3(a), each Party's obligations (other than an obligation to pay any
amounts due to the other Party which shall not be suspended under this Section
12.1) shall be temporarily suspended during the occurrence of, and for the
entire duration of, a Force Majeure event to the extent that such an event
prevents Terminal Owner from performing its obligations under this Agreement.





12.2 Obligation to Remedy Force Majeure Events. A Party affected by a Force
Majeure event shall take commercially reasonable steps to remedy such
situation so that it may resume the full performance of its obligations under
this Agreement within a reasonable period of time.

12.3 Strikes and Lockouts. The settlement of strikes, lockouts and other labor
disturbances shall be entirely within the discretion of the affected Party and
the requirement to remedy a Force Majeure event within a reasonable period of
time shall not require the settlement of strikes or lockouts by acceding to
the demands of an opposing Person when such course is inadvisable in the
discretion of the Party having the difficulty.

12.4 Action in Emergencies. Terminal Owner may temporarily suspend performance
of the Services to prevent injuries to Persons, damage to property or harm to
the environment.

ARTICLE 13

TERMINATION; NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES

13.1 Default; Right to Terminate.

(a) Default. If either Party defaults in the prompt performance and observance
of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and if such default
continues for 15 days or more after written notice thereof by the non-
defaulting Party to the defaulting Party, or should either Party become
insolvent, commence a case for liquidation or reorganization under the United
States Bankruptcy Code (or become the involuntary subject of a case for
liquidation or reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code, if such
case is not dismissed within 30 days), be placed in the hands of a state or
federal receiver or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, then
the other Party shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this
Agreement immediately upon delivery of written notice to the defaulting Party.

(b) Effect of Default. In the event of a default by MPC, the amounts accrued
with respect to this Agreement shall, at the option of Terminal Owner, become
immediately due and payable. In the event of default by Terminal Owner under
this Agreement, MPC shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this
Agreement, provided that MPC shall have paid Terminal Owner amounts that have
accrued under the Agreement to the date of such termination.

13.2 Termination Following a Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure event
prevents Terminal Owner or MPC from performing its respective obligations at
one or more Terminals for a period of more than 12 consecutive Months, this
Agreement as to the Terminals so affected may be terminated by either Party
and any time after the expiration of such 12 Month period upon at least 30
days' written notice to the other Party.

13.3 Non-Exclusive Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the remedies of Terminal Owner and MPC provided in this Agreement shall not be
exclusive, but shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to all other
remedies in favor of Terminal Owner or MPC at law or in equity.

shall comply with, all valid and applicable Laws, including environmental and
product quality Laws applicable to fuels.



14.10 Waiver. No waiver by either Party of any default of the other Party
shall operate as a waiver of any further or future default, whether of like or
different character.

14.11 Governing Law. This Agreement, and any dispute arising hereunder, shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflict of laws provisions thereof to the extent such rules or principles
would require or permit the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

14.12 Terms Severable. Any invalid or unenforceable provision shall adjusted

Butane Blending



From and after September 1, 2016, Terminal Owner's fee for performing the
butane blending service shall be calculated as follows:



Ninety-five percent (95%) of the difference between the Daily Gasoline Value
(defined below) and the Daily Butane Value (defined below). Expressed as a
formula, the Butane Blending Service Fee is:



Butane Blending Service Fee = (DGV-DBV)* 95%





Bay City Butane Blending Service Fee = (DGV-DBV+CPP)* 95%



Definitions:



1. Daily Gasoline Value ("DGV"): Expressed as a formula: 

DGV = (GB)*(GPV+TF)



GB: number of gallons of butane blended on a given day at the terminal site.

GPV: daily gasoline posted value per gallon.

TF: the transportation fee for moving spot purchased gasoline to the terminal
for the gasoline grade in which the butane is blended.

The TF is the avoided MPC cost of transporting one Gallon of gasoline (in the
most cost effective method possible) to a terminal blending location, as
verified and provided by MPC's Supply Distribution and Planning - Light Products
Project Analysis organization. 

 

2. Daily Butane Value ("DBV"): the daily agreed upon butane purchase price ("BPP") from Sunoco Logistics ("SXL"), plus the total daily RIN value (DRV), multiplied by the daily total number of butane gallons blended ("GB"). Expressed as a formula:



DBV = (GB)*(BPP+DRV)





"DRV" will be determined by using the percentage of each type of RINs
specified by the Renewable Fuel Standard Program updated annually or the most
recent requirements and will be adjusted retroactively for any difference
between the requirements at the time of the calculation and the requirements
contained in a final rule establishing Renewable Volume Obligations for the
year. OPIS daily posting for the respective RINs pricing will be used. In
order to minimize the daily average RINs Cost, postings for prior years RINs
will be used up to the maximum allowable percentage.

Conditional Performance Payment ("CPP"): For each calendar month, a
Conditional Performance Payment is paid by Sunoco Partners Marketing and
Terminals L.P. ("SPMT") to MPC for volumes blended at the Bay City terminal.
The ("CPP") is calculated as the greater of (1) the volume of gallons blended
("GB") at Bay City in such month multiplied by fifty percent multiplied by the
following value: (A) the daily average of the high and low assessments of
Argus posted Chicago Cycle 1 gasoline price (85 CBOB or 91 PREM) minus (B) the
daily average of the high and low assessments of the OPIS posted Mt. Belvieu
TET normal butane price minus (C) $0.60 per gallon; and (2) $0. 

 

Fee calculations pursuant to this Schedule 5.1 for butane blending services
completed prior to September 1, 2016 shall not be affected by changes in the
foregoing formulas.



Ethanol Denaturing



$0.02 per Gallon of undenatured ethanol.





Unit Train Ethanol Receipts



Beginning on January 15, 2017 and continuing thereafter for so long as the
Master Terminal Services Agreement by and between MPC and ECO Energy
Distribution Services, LLC dated October 19, 2015 (the "ECO Agreement") has
not terminated, been cancelled or otherwise expired pursuant to its terms or
agreement of the parties thereto, each of the following shall apply:



1. MPC shall pay Terminal Owner $0.0135 per Gallon for Unit Train Ethanol Receipts; provided that the invoice for the month ending March 31 of each year (or upon termination of the ECO Agreement, prorated according to the time of such termination) shall include an additional fee of $0.0135 per Gallon of Unit Train Ethanol Receipts that are less than 111,360,000 Gallons for the 12-month period ending on March 31 of the same year (prorated for the time period between January 15, 2017 through March 31, 2017. The $0.0135 per Gallon fee set forth in this Section shall be adjusted at the time of and in an amount equal to any adjustment to the Throughput Fees (as defined in the ECO Agreement) pursuant to Section 6.1(b) of the ECO Agreement, as may be amended from time to time.





2\. At the end of each Calendar Quarter, Terminal Owner shall credit MPC on
the monthly invoice (or upon termination of the ECO Agreement, prorated
according to the time of such termination) an amount equal to the sum of (a)
the Base Throughput Fee for Selma (Buffalo) set forth in Schedule 5.1 (as
adjusted) multiplied by the volume (in Gallons) of ethanol redelivered by
truck from the Selma (Buffalo) Terminal to the Selma (West Oak) or Selma (JV)
- Johnston County Terminals during such Calendar Quarter; and (b) the Base
Throughput Fee for Selma (Buffalo) set forth in Schedule 5.1 (as adjusted)
multiplied by the volume (in Gallons) of ethanol redelivered per MPC's
direction from the Selma (Buffalo) Terminal into trucks for ECO during such
Calendar Quarter.





Schedule 7.1 - Market Price Formula



Each terminal location is assigned to the CHICAGO (Midwest) or US GULF COAST
(Southeast) region based on Schedule 3.1.



Ordinary Handling Losses in excess of 0.25% will be valued via pricing
gasoline and distillate proration between OPIS 87 CBOB and OPIS Ultra-low
sulfur diesel, considering CHICAGO/US GULF COAST markets to determine one
weighted average price for the given month.



Extraordinary Losses will be valued based on individual incident. The OPIS
price for commodity or commodities involved in the incident will be used,
considering CHICAGO/US GULF COAST pricing based on the Terminal Location
Assignment. If the incident involves Transmix, valuation should be based on
the lower of the OPIS 87 CBOB or Ultra-low sulfur diesel value less
$0.10/gallon, considering CHICAGO/US GULF COAST pricing based on the Terminal
location.



VRU Gains will be valued using the OPIS 87 CBOB price for given market based
on the Terminal location.







Schedule 7.3(a) - VRU Gains



VRU Gains for truck rack throughput at Terminals equipped with TAS shall be
calculated via logic in the TAS for any Products with a default product group
of "Gasolines." The TAS shall be programmed to calculate the VRU Gains by
multiplying the applicable "Gasolines" throughput volumes at such Terminal by
a factor of 1.5 and dividing the resulting product by 1,000. Calculations made
prior to January 1, 2017 pursuant to this Schedule 7.3(a) shall not be
affected by the change in the foregoing factor.



At Terminals that are not equipped to calculate the VRU Gains via TAS at the
rack or via other modalities, including barge loading facilities, Terminal
Owner shall calculate the VRU Gains by multiplying the applicable actual
gasoline throughputs at such Terminal for the applicable Calendar Month by a
factor of 1.5 and dividing the resulting product by 1,000. Calculations made
prior to January 1, 2017 pursuant to this Schedule 7.3(a) shall not be
affected by the change in the foregoing factor.



The factor used in calculating the VRU Gains is subject to unilateral
adjustment, at Terminal Owner's option, provided that the VRU data reviewed
annually supports said adjustment. Further, Terminal Owner may elect, at its
option, to utilize factors based on terminal location rather than a general
factor applied to all terminal locations. If Terminal Owner elects to
determine VRU Gains utilizing terminal-specific factors, then Terminal Owner
and MPC shall execute an amendment to this Agreement that provides a list of
terminal locations and their respective factors. In either case, Terminal
Owner shall provide MPC with all documentation supporting any factor
adjustments. If MPC believes that the documentation does not support a factor
adjustment, MPC shall provide written notice to Terminal Owner within 30
calendar days, and the Parties shall negotiate a mutually agreeable factor.
Calculations made prior to any such unilateral adjustment pursuant to this
Schedule 7.3(a) shall not be affected by any such adjustment in the foregoing
factor; such adjustments to be prospectively applied unless otherwise agreed
by the Parties.
