"Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
specified.

(f) Joint Participation. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or

Section 2.2; and

(B) deliver to Seller the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to

Seller shall provide Purchaser with a statement with a written estimate of
each of (i) Working Capital, (ii) Indebtedness of the Company and (iii) the
CapEx Shortfall Amount, in each case as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing
Statement"), which shall be accompanied by a notice that sets forth (A)
Seller's determination of the Closing Payment Adjustments and the Purchase
Price after giving effect to the Closing Payment Adjustments and (B) the
account or accounts to which Purchaser shall transfer the Purchase Price

Indebtedness of the Company as of the Closing set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement shall give effect to the repayment of Repayment Debt
pursuant to Section 5.16, which repayment shall have been completed at or

(b) The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles attached as Schedule I hereto (the "Accounting
Principles") and in accordance with GAAP, in each case, applied consistently
with their application in connection with the preparation of the Company
Financial Statements. It is understood and agreed that Annex A of Schedule I
sets forth the calculation of the Target Working Capital (the "Target Working
Capital Statement").

(c) From and after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement until the
day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to,
(i) reasonably assist Purchaser and its Representatives in Purchaser's review
of the Estimated Closing Statement and (ii) make available the Representatives
responsible for preparing the Estimated Closing Statement to discuss the
Estimated Closing Statement with Purchaser. Seller shall consider in good
faith any comments on the Estimated Closing Statement submitted by Purchaser.

2.5 Post-Closing Statement.

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to Seller statements of (i) Working Capital, (ii)
Indebtedness of the Company, and (iii) the CapEx Shortfall Amount, in each
case as of the Closing (collectively, the "Initial Closing Statement"). The Initial Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and in accordance with GAAP, in each
case applied consistently with their application in connection with the
preparation of the Company Financial Statements.

(b) Following the Closing through the date that the Final Closing Statement
becomes final and binding, Seller and its Affiliates and representatives shall
be permitted to access and review the books, records and work papers of the
Company, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company) and its and their respective employees, accountants and other
representatives to, cooperate with and assist Seller and its Affiliates and
representatives in connection with such review, including by providing access
to such books, records and work papers and making available personnel to the
extent reasonably requested; provided, that the accountants of Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall not be obliged to make any books, records or work papers
available to Seller and its Affiliates except in accordance with such
accountant's normal disclosure procedures and then only after Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to books, records and work papers.

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding, it will not take or permit
to be taken any actions with respect to any accounting books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Company Financial Statements or the
Initial Closing Statement is based, or on which the Final Closing Statement is
to be based, that would impede or delay the determination of the amount of
Working Capital, Indebtedness of the Company as of the Closing or the CapEx
Shortfall Amount or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the Final
Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods provided by this
Agreement.

2.6 Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statement.

(a) Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing no later than 30 days after
Seller's receipt of the Initial Closing Statement if Seller disagrees with the
Initial Closing Statement, which notice shall describe the basis for such
disagreement (the "Notice of Disagreement"). If no Notice of Disagreement is
delivered to Purchaser by such time, then the Initial Closing Statement shall
become final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with Section 2.6(c).

(b) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement (the "Resolution Period"), Seller and Purchaser shall seek to
resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

(c) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement to Grant Thornton LLP (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). Within
30 days after submission of such matters to the Independent Accounting Firm,
the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final determination in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and the terms and definitions of this Agreement
and based solely on the written submissions of the Parties, binding on the
Parties, of the appropriate amount of each of

 the matters that remain in dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement
that Seller and Purchaser have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
With respect to each disputed matter, such determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the
higher, or less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller in the
Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser in the Initial Closing Statement with
respect to such disputed matter. The Independent Accounting Firm shall not
review or make any determination with respect to any matter other than the
matters that remain in dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement. The
statements of (i) Working Capital, (ii) Indebtedness of the Company and (iii)
the CapEx Shortfall Amount that are final and binding on the Parties, as
determined either through agreement of the Parties pursuant to Section 2.6(a)
or Section 2.6(b) or through the action of the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 2.6(c), are referred to as the "Final Closing
Statement."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser on the other hand. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Company) and
its and their respective employees, accountants and other representatives to,
each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such
personnel, and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be
reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its
obligations under Section 2.6(c); provided, that the accountants of Seller or
Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the
Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with such accountants' normal
disclosure procedures and then only after such Independent Accounting Firm has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers. In acting
under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert
and not an arbitrator.

(e) The process set forth in Section 2.5 and this Section 2.6 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of any of the Parties and their respective
Affiliates for any disputes related to the Closing Payment Adjustments, the
Post-Closing Adjustment and the calculations and amounts on which they are
based or set forth in the related statements and notices delivered in
connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, the calculations to be made
pursuant to Section 2.5 and this Section 2.6 and the Closing Payment
Adjustments and Post-Closing Adjustment are not intended to be used to adjust
for errors or omissions that may be found with respect to the Company
Financial Statements or any inconsistencies between the Company Financial
Statements or the Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the
other hand. After the determination of the Final Closing Statement, none of
the Parties shall have the right to make any claim based upon the preparation
of the Final Closing Statement or the calculation of Working Capital,
Indebtedness or the CapEx Shortfall Amount as of the Closing (even if
subsequent events or subsequently discovered facts would have affected the
determination of the Final Closing Statement or the calculations of Working
Capital, Indebtedness or the CapEx Shortfall Amount had such subsequent events
or subsequently discovered facts been known at the time of the determination
of the Final Closing Statement).

2.7 Post-Closing Adjustment. The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be equal to
(a) (i) the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus (ii) the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus (b) (i) the amount of Indebtedness of
the Company set forth in the Final Closing Statement minus (ii) the amount of Indebtedness of the Company
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement minus (c) (i) the CapEx Shortfall
Amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement minus (ii) the Estimated CapEx
Shortfall Amount. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, pay in cash to Seller
(or one or more Affiliates designated by Seller) the amount of the Post-
Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then
Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) shall pay in cash to Purchaser
the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such
payment pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be made within ten Business Days
after the determination of the Final Closing Statement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

2.8 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under the Code, or any
other provision of applicable Law; provided, that prior to making any such
deduction or withholding, Purchaser shall notify Seller of its intent to
withhold amounts from such payments no less than 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing or, if later, as soon as reasonably practicable and shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to establish an applicable exemption from such deduction
or withholding, if available. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts (i) will be remitted by Purchaser to the applicable
taxing authority and (ii) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was
made.

Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of the Company's
Subsidiaries, each of which is under the exclusive direct or indirect control
of the Company or its designees. Other than as set forth in Section 3.1 of the

subscriptions, options, warrants, stock appreciation rights, redemption

securities or other agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the issued or unissued share capital or other equity ownership
interest in the Company or any other securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company, and no securities
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company has
no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations that provide the

exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the sole stockholder
of the Company on any matter.

3.3 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Seller has, and each member of the

delivery and performance by Seller and each member of the Seller Group of this
Agreement and the Final Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been,

applicable, of this Agreement or any Final Ancillary Document to which it is a
party. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Seller, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes, and each Final Ancillary
Document to which Seller or any member of the Seller Group is a party, when
executed and delivered by the members of the Seller Group party thereto, and,

Document by Parent, Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate party thereto, will
constitute, a valid, legal and binding agreement of the applicable members of
the Seller Group, enforceable against each such member in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, or general principles of equity
(collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions").

3.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. No filing with or notice to, and no
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required on the part of
Seller or any member of the Seller Group for the execution, delivery and

by Seller of this Agreement or any Final Ancillary Document to which Seller or

the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) conflict with or
result in any breach or violation of any provision of its Organizational
Documents or the Organizational Documents of the Company, (ii) result in a

filing (or furnishing) date and, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of each such amendment, each Company SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date

Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective prior to
the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material

income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes

external purposes in conformity with GAAP. The Company has disclosed to the
Company's external auditors (a) any "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company, as applicable, required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

unlawful accounting or auditing matters with respect to the Company and (ii)
no attorney representing Seller or its Subsidiaries (including the Company),
whether or not employed by Seller or its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence

violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Seller's or the Company's
Board of Directors or any of the respective committees thereof or to the
general counsel or chief executive officer of Seller or the Company or any
Subsidiary of Seller pursuant to the rules of the SEC adopted under Section
307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except, in each case, as has not resulted in,
and that would not reasonably be expected to result in, (x) any material
adjustment or change to the Company Financial Statements or (y) a finding of a
"significant deficiency" or a "material weakness" (as such terms are defined
in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board).

(b) Section 3.8(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each

of what is being withheld. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
from and against any Losses incurred by Seller, its Affiliates or its or their

afforded by the applicable Party upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours, and will be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere with the operation of the business of any Party or its respective
Affiliates. The Party exercising the right of access hereunder will be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by either Party in connection
therewith. Each Party shall retain such books and records for a period of
seven years from the Closing Date.

5.3 Confidentiality.

(a) For a period of two years following the Closing, each of Parent and
Purchaser will, and will cause their respective Affiliates and the Purchaser's
Representatives to, hold all of Seller's Confidential Information in strict
confidence and not disclose any of Seller's Confidential Information to any
Person other than its Affiliates and its Representatives; provided, however,
that upon the Closing, the provisions of (x) this Section 5.3 and (y) the
Confidentiality Agreement will, in each case, expire with respect to any
information to the extent related to the Company ("Company Confidential
Information").

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 5.3(a), Parent or Purchaser may
disclose Seller's Confidential Information to the extent that such information
(i) becomes publicly available after the Closing other than as a result of a
disclosure, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Purchaser or their respective
Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) becomes available to
Parent or Purchaser after the Closing on a non-confidential basis from a
source that Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, reasonably believes is not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation or (iii) is developed by Parent or Purchaser
independently after the Closing without use of any of Seller's Confidential
Information. In the event that Parent, Purchaser or their respective
Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable Law to
disclose any of Seller's Confidential Information, Parent, Purchaser or such
Representative, as applicable, shall promptly notify Seller so that Seller may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and Parent, Purchaser or
such Representative, as applicable, will cooperate with Seller in such effort.
In the absence of such protective order or other remedy, Parent, Purchaser or
such Representative, as applicable, will furnish only that portion of Seller's
Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required
(after consulting with Seller and its counsel as to such disclosure and the
nature and wording of such disclosure) and will exercise all reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such Confidential Information.

(c) If the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, at Seller's
request, Parent and Purchaser will promptly return to Seller or destroy all
copies of any Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of, and as
required by, the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) For a period of two years following the Closing, Seller will, and will
cause its Affiliates and its Representatives to, hold (x) all of Purchaser's
Confidential Information and (y) all Company Confidential Information, in each
case, in strict confidence and not disclose any of Purchaser's Confidential
Information or Company Confidential Information to any Person other than its
Affiliates and Representatives; provided, however, that the terms
"Confidential Information" and "Company Confidential Information" shall not
include information that (i) becomes publicly available after the Closing
other than as a result of a disclosure, directly or indirectly, by Seller or
its Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) becomes available to
Seller after the Closing on a non-confidential basis from a source that Seller
reasonably believes is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (iii) is developed by Seller

Information or Company Confidential Information. In the event that Seller or
its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable Law
to disclose any of Purchaser's Confidential Information or any Company
Confidential Information, Seller or its applicable Representative shall
promptly notify Purchaser so that Purchaser may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy, and Seller (or its applicable Representative) will
cooperate with Purchaser in such effort. In the absence of such protective
order or other remedy, Seller or its applicable Representative will furnish
only that portion of Purchaser's Confidential Information and/or Company
Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required
(after consulting with Purchaser and its counsel as to such disclosure and the
nature and wording of such disclosure) and will exercise all reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such Confidential Information and/or Company Confidential
Information.

 5.4 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at any time or from time to time after the Closing, each of Seller, Parent and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such other documents and instruments, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper
or advisable, to the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement and to cause the Sale and other transactions contemplated
hereby to occur.

(a) Seller and Purchaser will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate,
prepare and file as promptly as practicable all necessary applications,

to it or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which appear in
any filing made by the other Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Purchaser and Seller, acting reasonably and in good faith, will

the process for obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations of any Governmental Entity (including the Required Regulatory
Approvals), and the making or discussing of any and all proposals relating to
any regulatory commitments of Purchaser, Seller, their respective Affiliates
or business, or with any Governmental Entity, its staff, intervenors or
customers, in each case, in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Seller, acting reasonably and in good
faith, will coordinate, and Seller will cause the Company to coordinate, with
respect to the scheduling and conduct of all meetings with Governmental
Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Required Regulatory Approvals); provided, however, to the
fullest extent practicable and permitted by Law, in connection with any
communications, meetings, or other contacts, oral or written, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and will cause its Affiliates to): (i)

including the subject matter, contents, intended agenda, and other aspects of any of the foregoing;

contacts; (iv) notify the other Party of any oral communications with any
Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing; and (v) provide the
other Party with copies of all written communications with any Governmental
Entity relating to any of the foregoing. Nothing in this Section 5.5(b) will
apply to or restrict communications or other actions by a Party with or with
respect to any Governmental Entity in connection with its business in the
ordinary course of business.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any action, including (i)
acquiring any asset, property, business or Person (by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, investment, or other business combination,
asset, stock or equity purchase, or otherwise) from any Person (other than, in
the case of Purchaser, from Seller or its Affiliates), (ii) making any filing
or (iii) any other action, that, in each case, could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect obtaining or making, or the timing of obtaining or making,
any consent or approval contemplated by this Section 5.5. In furtherance of
and without limiting any of Purchaser's or Seller's covenants and agreements
under this Section 5.5, each of Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all
undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the Required
Regulatory Approvals, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable, including (A) agreeing to conditions imposed by, or
taking any action required by, any Governmental Entity, (B) defending through
litigation on the merits, including appeals, any Action asserted by any court
or other proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Entity, that

Burdensome Condition or Seller Burdensome Condition, and proposing alternative

of (1) with respect to Purchaser, any assets or business of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or of the Company, and (2) with respect to Seller, any Unregulated
Non-Retail Business, in each case, including entering into customary ancillary
agreements relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition,
and (E) agreeing to take any other action as may be required by a Governmental
Entity in order to effect each of the following: (1) obtaining all Required
Regulatory Approvals as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event before
the Outside Date, (2) avoiding the entry of, or having vacated, lifted,
dissolved, reversed or overturned, any Order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of, or impedes, interferes with or delays, the Closing and (3)

otherwise have the effect of preventing, prohibiting or restricting
consummation of the Closing or impeding, interfering with or delaying the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the entry
into any settlement with a Governmental Entity or intervenor, or the filing
with any Governmental Entity or the publication of any document containing any
commitments regarding a Required Regulatory Approval of any Party or their
Affiliates, must be mutually agreed

 between Seller and Purchaser, provided that nothing in this sentence shall
modify or diminish any of Seller's or Purchaser's obligations under this
Section 5.5.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to,
and neither Seller nor the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall, in connection with obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals or
setting such filings for hearing, settlement or other investigation, consent
to, or take any action, in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, results of operations or financial condition of Purchaser
and its Affiliates (including the Company), taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Sale; provided, that Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company) shall be deemed to be the same size as the Company for purposes of
this Section 5.5(d) (any such action or requirement, a "Purchaser Burdensome
Condition"); and provided further, any regulatory mitigation action taken by
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Plants EIPA
or any mitigation ordered relating directly to the transactions contemplated
by the Plants EIPA shall not be taken into account in the determination of
whether there has been a Purchaser Burdensome Condition. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the exclusions set forth in the definition of "Company Material
Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to apply to any reference to "material adverse
effect" in this Section 5.5(d).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to, and
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, in connection with
obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals or setting such filings for
hearing, settlement or other investigation, consent to, or take any action, in
each case, that, (i) would require Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company) to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or
business, other than any assets or business of the Unregulated Non-Retail
Business, (ii) individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of
operations or financial condition of Seller's remaining electric businesses,

effect to the Sale; provided, that for the purposes of this clause (ii) such
remaining electric businesses shall be deemed to be the same size as the
Company; (iii) individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of
operations or financial condition of the Unregulated Non-Retail Business,
taken as a whole; provided, that for the purposes of this clause (iii) the
Unregulated Non-Retail Business shall be deemed to be the same size as the
Company, or (iv) individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on the manner in which the remaining transmission or generation
assets of Seller or any of its Affiliates are operated, including a change in
control over such operations (any such action or requirement in (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv), a "Seller Burdensome Condition"); and provided, further, that
none of the obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates set forth in or
contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements (in, for the avoidance of doubt, the
forms attached to this Agreement), the matters set forth in Section 5.20 or
the matters set forth in Section 5.20(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
shall be taken into account in the determination of whether there has been a
Seller Burdensome Condition.

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to, and neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall, in connection with obtaining the Required
Regulatory Approvals, consent to the taking of any action or the imposition of
any terms, conditions, limitations or standards of service the effectiveness
or consummation of which is not conditional upon the occurrence of the
Closing.

(g) In furtherance, and not in limitation, of Sections 5.5(a), 5.5(b) and
5.5(c), but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.5(d) (with
respect to Purchaser and its Affiliates) and Section 5.5(e) (with respect to
Seller and its Affiliates), Seller and Purchaser will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other and use reasonable best
efforts to cause the FERC to accept for filing pursuant to Section 205 of the
Federal Power Act, 18 U.S.C. s. 824d ("Section 205") the Final Ancillary
Documents.

5.6 Consents. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to obtain any consents required from third parties in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under Company Material Contracts or Permits at or prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither
Seller nor Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any
obligation to make any payments or incur any Liability to obtain any consents
of third parties contemplated by this Section 5.6, and the failure to receive
any such consents shall not be taken into account with respect to whether any
condition to the Closing set forth in Article VIII shall have been fulfilled
(but the accuracy of Section 3.4 will be taken into account).

5.7 Public Announcements. Purchaser and Seller shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other written public statements with
respect to the Sale, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such written public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party
reasonably concludes (after consultation with outside counsel) to be required
by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall limit a Party's (or its respective Affiliates') rights to
disclose the existence of this Agreement and the general nature of the
transaction described herein on any earnings call or in similar discussions
with financial media or analysts, stockholders and other members of the
investment community, provided that such disclosures are consistent in all
material respects with disclosures previously made pursuant to this Section
5.7.

5.8 Intercompany Accounts. At or prior to the Closing, all intercompany
accounts between Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall be settled except as set forth on Section
5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

5.9 Settlement of Intercompany Arrangements. At or prior to the Closing, all
Contracts (other than those Contracts set forth on Section 5.9 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter) between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand (collectively, the "Intercompany Arrangements")
shall be settled or terminated, without any party having any continuing
obligations or liability to the other. No such Intercompany Arrangement
(including any provision thereof which purports to survive termination) shall
be of any further force or effect after the Closing and Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after the Closing, the Company) shall be released from all
Liabilities thereunder.

5.10 Guarantees. Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause itself, one of its Affiliates or the Company to be substituted in all
respects for Seller and any of its Affiliates, and for Seller and its
Affiliates to be released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of, or
otherwise terminate (and cause Seller and its Affiliates to be released in
respect of), all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under each of
the guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort,
commitments, understandings, agreements and other obligations of such Persons
related to the Company that are set forth on Section 5.10 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Substituted Guarantees"). For any of the
guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments,
understandings, agreements and other obligations of Seller and any of their
respective Affiliates related to the Company for which Purchaser or the
Company, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects for Seller and its
Affiliates (or for which Seller and its Affiliates are not released) effective
as of the Closing and that cannot otherwise be terminated effective as of the
Closing without causing an adverse effect on the Company (with Seller and its
Affiliates to be released in respect thereof), (a) Seller shall, or shall
cause its applicable Affiliates, to keep in place such Substituted Guarantees
("Continuing Guarantees"), (b) Purchaser shall continue to use its
commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause the Company to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution or termination and
release with respect to the Continuing Guarantees as promptly as practical
after the Closing and (c) Purchaser or Parent shall reimburse Seller for all
amounts paid or incurred by Seller or its Affiliates to the extent any
guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments,
understandings, agreements and other obligations are called upon and Seller or
any of its Affiliates make any payment or are obligated to reimburse the
issuing thereof. In addition, commencing on the date that is six months after
the Closing Date, on the last Business Day of each three month period
following the Closing Date until such time as no Continuing Guarantees remain
outstanding, Purchaser shall pay Seller or its designee a fee in respect of
each Continuing Guarantee equal to the amount of fees Seller or such
applicable Affiliate would have incurred if it posted a letter of credit in
respect of the amounts covered by such Continuing Guaranty for such three
month period (or, with respect to any Continuing Guarantee outstanding for a
portion, but not all, of such three month period, for such portion of such
three month period). Without limiting the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates shall extend or renew any Contract containing or underlying
a Continuing Guarantee unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension or
renewal, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including the Company) is
substituted in all respects for Seller and any of its Affiliates under such
Continuing Guarantee. For purposes of this Section 5.10, "commercially
reasonable efforts" will be limited to offering to provide to the applicable
beneficiary of a Substituted Guarantee, and providing such beneficiary, such
replacement guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort,
commitments, understandings, agreements and other obligations as are
substantially similar in form and substance to the Substituted Guarantees.

5.11 Usage of Certain Marks. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within 150 days following Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company to, cease using Seller Marks, including removing Seller Marks from any
properties or assets relating to the Company. Except for the limited
transitional use of Seller Marks as immediately set forth above, Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, use Seller Marks belonging to
Seller or

 any Affiliate thereof immediately following the Closing, and Purchaser
acknowledges that it and its Affiliates have no rights whatsoever to use
Seller Marks or related Intellectual Property of Seller and its Affiliates. In
addition, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 150 days
following Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease
using Company Marks, including removing Company Marks from any properties or
assets relating to Seller and its Affiliates, and Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, use Company Marks or any logos, trademarks or
trade names belonging to the Company or any Affiliate thereof immediately
following the Closing, and Seller acknowledges that it and its Affiliates have
no rights whatsoever to use Company Marks or such logos, trademarks or trade
names or related Intellectual Property of the Company and its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding Purchaser's right to use Seller Marks and Seller's right to
use Company Marks for the time periods set forth above, each Party agrees that
(a) neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be deemed an agent,
representative or joint venture partner of Seller, (b) neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall be deemed an agent, representative or joint venture
partner of Purchaser, (c) Seller and its Affiliates shall retain sole and
exclusive ownership of Seller Marks and all goodwill and rights related
thereto, (d) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall retain sole and exclusive
ownership of Company Marks and all goodwill and rights related thereto, (e)
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not knowingly take any action in respect of
Seller Marks that would adversely affect Seller or its Affiliates, or the
interest of Seller or its Affiliates in the Seller Marks and (f) Seller and
its Affiliates shall not knowingly take any action in respect of Company Marks
that would adversely affect the Company or its Affiliates, or the interest of
Company or its Affiliates in the Company Marks.

5.12 Alternative Transactions. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller
shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, negotiate with, provide any
nonpublic information regarding the Company to, enter into any Contract with,
or in any manner encourage, any proposal of, any Person (other than Purchaser
and its Affiliates) relating to a potential acquisition of all or a material
portion of the equity interests or assets of the Company, whether by merger,
sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise (collectively, "Acquisition
Proposals"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.12 is
intended to restrict or limit Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates from
entering into, engaging in or consummating any transaction not involving the
Company, its business or its assets. Seller shall immediately cease all
communications with any such Person that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof and request that each such Person
promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of Seller in connection with any such Acquisition
Proposal.

action, suits, accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, damages, claims and
other Liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in law and in
equity, arising out of or in connection with any breach by Seller or any
director or officer of the Company of any fiduciary duty in their capacity as
an equityholder, director or officer of the Company prior to the Closing Date.
Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall make, and neither Parent nor Purchaser
shall permit any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
representatives to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting
any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any
indemnification, against any of Seller or its Affiliates or any of their
Releasees with respect to any Liabilities or other matters released pursuant
to this Section 5.13.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 5.13(a) and Section 5.13(b) shall
not constitute a release from, waiver of, or otherwise apply to the terms of
(i) this Agreement, the Gas SPA, the Plants EIPA or any Final Ancillary
Document or any Liability or Contract expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, the Gas SPA, the Plants EIPA or any Final Ancillary Document to be
in effect after the Closing, or any enforcement thereof or (ii) any other
Contract, arrangement or other matter arising between Parent, Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.

5.14 Litigation Support. If and for so long as Seller, Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective Affiliates are prosecuting, contesting or defending
any Action by a third party in connection with (a) any transactions
contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection with, or
arising from this Agreement or the Company, Parent, Purchaser or Seller, as
the case may be, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company,
if applicable (and its and their officers and employees) to, cooperate with
the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective counsel (at the
expense of the requesting Party) in such prosecution, contest or defense,
including making available its personnel and providing such testimony and
access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection
with such prosecution, contest or defense.



 5.15 Financing Covenant.

(a) Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and on or prior to the Closing Date obtain any debt financing
necessary for Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Seller agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Purchaser, at Purchaser's expense and solely as an accommodation
to Purchaser, in connection with the arrangement of any financing to be
consummated with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
agreed and understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement for Purchaser to obtain any financing); provided that such requested
cooperation does not (i) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company, (ii) cause any breach of this Agreement or cause any condition of
this Agreement not to be satisfied, (iii) conflict with, violate or breach any
applicable Law, the Organizational Documents of the Company or any material
Contract to which the Company is a party, (iv) result in a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege or the protection of attorney work-product (provided
that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege) or (v) require participation by Seller in
any road shows. If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to this
Section 5.15(b), the Company shall, to the extent possible without violating
legal restrictions or risking a loss of attorney client privilege, inform
Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.15(b) shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed that Purchaser will
be permitted to disclose such information to any financing sources or
prospective financing sources that are or may become parties to any financing
to be consummated with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (and,
in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
information is furnished by Purchaser subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings in connection with such financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) neither Seller nor the
Company shall have any Liability under any Contract or other document related
to such financing or otherwise be required to incur any Liability in
connection with such financing and (B) no obligations of the Company under any
Contract or other document relating to such financing shall be effective
unless and until the Closing occurs.

(c) Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Company) for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
any of them in connection with such cooperation or otherwise in connection
with any such financing. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective representatives from and against any
and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with any such
financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except with
respect to (i) historical information furnished in writing by the Company,
including financial statements, or (ii) any fraud of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.



 5.16 Treatment of Certain Indebtedness. Seller shall, and shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take other actions
required to facilitate (a) the termination of commitments in respect of the
Repayment Debt at or prior to the Closing Date, (b) repayment in full of all
obligations in respect of such Repayment Debt at or prior to the Closing Date
and (c) release of any Encumbrances and guarantees in connection therewith at
or prior to the Closing Date.

5.17 Final Ancillary Documents. Purchaser and Seller shall commence
discussions in good faith within 15 Business Days following the date of this
Agreement to establish a migration plan with respect to matters contemplated
by the Ancillary Agreements. At or prior to the Closing, each of Seller,
Parent and Purchaser shall, or shall cause their respective applicable
Affiliates to, execute and deliver, and cause the effectiveness of, each of
the Final Ancillary Documents.

5.18 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) For a period of six years commencing on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Company to: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, all
of the past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company (in
all of their capacities) (collectively, the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against
any and all Losses incurred in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided under
the Company's Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof, (ii)
without limitation of clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, cause to be maintained in effect the provisions regarding
elimination of liability of directors, and indemnification of and advancement
of expenses to directors, officers and employees contained in the
Organizational Documents of the Company that are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement and (iii) not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened proceeding (and in which
indemnification could be sought by a DandO Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent (A) includes an unconditional release
of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
proceeding or (B) provides solely for monetary damages to be paid by Purchaser
or the Company pursuant to this Section 5.18(a), or such DandO Indemnified Party
otherwise consents in writing to the entry of such judgment, and cooperates in
the defense of such proceeding or threatened proceeding.

(b) The obligations of Purchaser and the Company under this Section 5.18 shall
not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this Section 5.18 applies without the written consent
of such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.18 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.18, and this Section 5.18 shall be enforceable
by such DandO Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and
legal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Purchaser and the Company).

(c) If Purchaser or, following the Closing, the Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or

 merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.18.

(d) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.18 shall be
in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company, or under any applicable contracts or
Laws, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, honor and perform
under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company.

5.19 Insurance. With respect to events, circumstances or claims relating to
the Company or its business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
that result or are reasonably expected to result in losses in excess of (a)
$3,000,000 and are covered by Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence-based
property insurance or third-party liability insurance, or $1,000,000 and are
covered by Seller's or its Affiliates' occurrence based workers' compensation
insurance policies that apply to the Company or the locations at which the
Company is operated (collectively, the "Pre-Closing Insurance"), Purchaser or
its applicable Subsidiary may make claims under the Pre-Closing Insurance to
the extent such coverage and limits are available to the Company under the
Pre-Closing Insurance and, with respect to occurrence-based property insurance
and third-party liability insurance, any such claim is known prior to the date
that is six months after the Closing. By making any claims under the Pre-
Closing Insurance, Purchaser agrees to reimburse, or cause its applicable
subsidiary to reimburse, Seller or its Affiliates for any direct costs
incurred by any of them as a direct result of such claims; and Purchaser or
its applicable Subsidiary shall exclusively bear the amount of any
"deductibles" or net retentions associated with such claims under the Pre-
Closing Insurance and shall be liable for all uninsured or uncovered amounts
of such claims (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not bear any liability
for any increases in premiums or other costs for the insurance policies of
Seller or its Affiliates).

5.20 Dispatch Procedures.

(a) From the date of this Agreement, the Parties will negotiate in good faith
and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to, prior to the Closing
Date, (i) dispatch procedures for Plant Scherer Unit 3 to be applied
immediately following the IIC Transition Period (the "Dispatch Procedures") in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.20 and set forth in an amendment
agreement in respect of any existing operating agreement for Plant Scherer
Unit 3 as may be necessary to ensure that the Dispatch Procedures are legally
binding obligations of certain Persons, including the Company and Georgia
Power Company, and (ii) an amendment to the existing operating agreement for,
and such other Contracts relating to, Plant Daniel necessary to implement the
terms set forth in Section 5.20(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter as
legally binding obligations of certain Persons, including the Company and
Mississippi Power Company (collectively, including any changes to such
Contracts that may be required by the FERC (but subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 5.5 as to the Parties' obligations to agree or commit to
such changes), the "Dispatch Contracts").

 (b) In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties agree to adopt and follow the
procedures in the Manual with respect to Plant Scherer Unit 3 to the extent
practicable, including the principles related to cost allocation and cost
responsibility and the scope and limitations on the dispatch rights set forth
in the Manual; provided, however, that the Parties acknowledge that the
operating characteristics of Plant Scherer Unit 3 are unique to that plant
and, therefore, the procedures in the Manual may have to be modified to
accommodate the needs and limitations of the Parties following the Closing.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, each of Seller, Parent and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver each of
the Dispatch Contracts.



ARTICLE VI


EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

6.1 Compensation and Employee Benefits.

(a) Compensation and Benefits Comparability. For a period commencing on the
Closing Date and expiring at the end of the first full calendar year following
the year in which the Closing Date occurs (the "Continuation Period"), Parent
will provide to each Company Employee, for so long as such Company Employee
remains employed during the Continuation Period, (i) base pay and annual
incentive compensation opportunity that are not less than such Company
Employee's base pay and annual incentive compensation opportunity immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the employee benefits (including equity-based compensation,
severance benefits, the non-qualified deferred compensation benefits
identified in Section 6.3(c), and other employee benefits specifically
required pursuant to this Article VI) provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, it being understood that the provisions of
this sentence shall cease to apply with respect to a Company Employee upon
termination of such Company Employee's employment with Parent and its
Affiliates, and that Parent need not replicate specific items of compensation
and employee benefits and may satisfy its obligations through a different
combination of compensation and employee benefits than are provided prior to
the Closing Date. If any Company Employee's employment is terminated without
cause during the Continuation Period, subject to such Company Employee's
execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, Parent will provide such
Company Employee with severance benefits pursuant to the terms of Parent's
applicable severance plan or policy (which shall provide benefits at least as
favorable as those available to the Company Employee pursuant to the Gulf
Power Company 2017 Separation Pay Plan); provided, however, that the
calculation of any such severance benefits shall take into account such
Company Employee's service with Seller or an Affiliate of Seller. Following
the Closing Date, Seller shall have no liability with respect to severance
benefits for Company Employees arising out of Parent's failure to comply with
its obligations under this Section 6.1(a), and Purchaser shall be obligated to
pay the benefit for and indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from any claim by or on behalf of any Company Employee for any severance
benefits that are payable due to Parent's failure to comply with its
obligations under this Section 6.1(a). The form and terms of any particular
benefit plan offered by Parent (a "New Plan") shall be as determined by
Parent, subject to the foregoing and the other provisions of this Article VI. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 6.1(a) shall not apply to any Company Employee covered
by a Labor Agreement, the terms and conditions of whose employment shall be as
set out in the applicable Labor Agreement (as it may be amended from time to
time) and applicable Law.

(b) Service Credit. Parent will recognize the service and seniority of each of
the Company Employees recognized by Seller for all benefits purposes,
including eligibility for, vesting and accrual of, and determination of the
levels of such benefits. However, service will not be recognized (i) to the
extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, (ii) except as expressly provided in Section 6.3(b), under defined
benefit pension plans or (iii) for purposes of grandfathered benefits.

(c) Welfare Plans. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to waive or cause
the waiver of any limitation on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions,
actively-at-work exclusions, evidence of insurability, and waiting periods for
the Company Employees under a New Plan providing medical, life or disability
benefits, to the extent that such limitations are waived or otherwise
inapplicable to a Company Employee under any comparable plan of Seller as of
the Closing Date. All healthcare expenses incurred by Company Employees or any
eligible dependent thereof, including any alternate recipient pursuant to
qualified medical child support orders, in the portion of the calendar year
preceding the Closing Date that were qualified to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller
health care plans will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any
deductible or out-of-pocket limit under the healthcare plan of Parent for such
calendar year. Seller will use reasonable best efforts to provide such
information to Parent. Seller will be responsible for making available COBRA
Continuation Coverage to any current and former employees of Seller, including
Company Employees, or to any qualified beneficiaries of such employees, who
become entitled to COBRA Continuation Coverage as a result of loss of group
health plan coverage under a Seller Benefit Plan. Parent will be responsible
for making available COBRA Continuation Coverage to any Company Employees (and
their qualified beneficiaries) who become entitled to such COBRA Continuation
Coverage on or after the Closing as a result of their loss of group health
plan coverage under any New Plan.

(d) Vacation. From and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, assume and honor all accrued but unused vacation and other paid
time-off of the Company Employees; provided, however, if Seller or any of its
Affiliates is required under applicable Law to make a payment in settlement of
accrued vacation or paid time off of any Company Employee, Parent shall make
or reimburse and hold harmless the Seller Group for such payment. For the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, assume and honor all supplemental paid vacation time
purchased by Company Employees pursuant to the Seller vacation purchase
option, subject to Seller's provision of sufficient information for Parent and
its Affiliates to provide such benefits.

6.2 Benefit Plan Assets and Liabilities Generally.

(a) Seller Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing, the Company Employees
shall cease to be active participants in the Seller Benefit Plans that are not
Company Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Article
VI, the Seller Group shall

 assume or retain, and indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company) in respect of, all assets and Liabilities related to
Seller Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans.

(b) Company Benefit Plans. Except as specifically set forth herein, the
Company shall assume or retain all assets and Liabilities related to all
Company Benefit Plans. Prior to Closing, Seller shall cause any assets and
Liabilities that do not relate to Company Employees to be transferred to
Seller Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans.

(c) Flexible Spending Accounts. As of the Closing Date, with respect to each
Company Employee participating immediately prior to Closing in any Company
Benefit Plan that is a health flexible spending account or dependent care
flexible spending account plan (the "Seller FSA Plans"), Seller will, or will
cause the Company to, transfer from the Seller FSA Plans to the applicable
health flexible spending account or dependent care flexible spending account
plan designated by Parent (the "Parent FSA Plan") the account balances
(positive or negative) of such Company Employees. Each Company Employee will
be permitted to continue to have payroll deduction made as most recently
elected by him or her under the applicable Seller FSA Plan. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, but not later than ten days
after the Closing Date, Seller will provide Parent with a reconciliation of
the underspent and overspent flexible spending accounts of Company Employees
in the Seller FSA Plans. Amounts forfeited by Company Employees in the Parent
FSA Plan at the end of the plan year during which the Closing occurs will be
assets of Parent.

(d) Wellness Program Benefits. Seller and Parent shall cooperate in good faith
to ensure that following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide each Company
Employee who has earned wellness rewards prior to Closing, including wellness
rewards in the form of a balance in a health reimbursement arrangement that is
a Seller Benefit Plan, but has been unable to use such amounts to pay for
qualifying medical expenses under the Seller Benefit Plans due to the
occurrence of the Closing Date subsequent to satisfaction of the wellness
requirements, with a wellness reward employee benefit (which may, but need
not, take the form of a health reimbursement arrangement) that provides a
substantially comparable value to the applicable earned but unused amount.

(e) Incentive Program. Within 30 days following the Closing Date, Seller or
one of its Affiliates shall pay to each Company Employee who is a participant
in an annual cash performance pay program of the Company, Seller, or an
Affiliate of Seller (a "PPP") the amount of compensation accrued, but not
paid, through the Closing Date with respect to the applicable PPP, which
amount shall be no less than that required to be paid pursuant to the Seller
Change in Control Plan (as defined in Section 6.3(d) below). For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall have no Liabilities in respect of the applicable PPP for
the period elapsed through the Closing Date, all of which shall be retained by
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

6.3 Retirement Plans.

(a) Seller shall fully vest all Company Employees in their account balances
under the retirement savings plan in which such Company Employees participate
(the "Seller's

 401(k) Plan"), effective as of the Closing. Effective as of the Closing,
Parent shall maintain or designate, or cause to be maintained or designated, a
defined contribution plan and related trust intended to be qualified under
Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 501(a) of the Code (the "Parent's 401(k) Plan").
Effective as of the Closing, the Company Employees shall cease participation
in Seller's 401(k) Plan. The Company Employees shall be eligible to
participate and shall commence participation in Parent's 401(k) Plan in
accordance with the terms of Parent's 401(k) Plan. Seller and Parent shall
cooperate to permit each Company Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) to Parent's 401(k) Plan in cash in an amount equal to the full
account balance distributed to such Company Employee from Seller's 401(k)
Plan. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to permit such rollover
contributions in the form of notes representing an employee loan under
Seller's 401(k) Plan and Parent shall take (or cause to be taken) any and all
reasonable action as may be required to provide that Company Employees may
continue to service any such loans through payroll deductions after the
Closing.

(b) With regard to The Southern Company Pension Plan or the successor plan
thereto (the "Seller Pension Plan"), each Pension Participant shall cease to
be a participant under such plan effective as of the Closing. Seller shall
fully vest all Company Employees participating in the Seller Pension Plan
effective as of the Closing. Effective as of the Closing, Parent shall have in
effect a defined benefit pension plan intended to be tax-qualified (the
"Parent Pension Plan" which may, for the avoidance of doubt, be a preexisting
plan of Parent) in which the Pension Participants shall be eligible to
participate. As soon as practicable (but, subject to the final sentence of
this Section 6.3(b), in no event more than 35 days) after the Closing (the
"Pension Transfer Deadline"), Seller shall cause the calculation and transfer
to the Parent Pension Plan of assets equal to (i) the amount required to be
transferred pursuant to Section 414(l) of the Code and such other applicable
Law, as determined using the actuarial assumptions and methodology consistent
with those used by Seller in its measurement of the accumulated benefit
obligation of the Seller Pension Plan under Accounting Standards Codification
Section 715 (the "ABO") with respect to the Pension Participants as of the
Closing (which actuarial assumptions and methodology are set forth in the
Seller Pension Materials), subject to any changes made to such actuarial
assumptions and methodology in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice that are acceptable to the actuaries of Seller and Parent or, if
applicable, the Chief Actuary under the procedures contemplated by Section
6.3(e), and subject to any requirements under such Section of the Code and
ERISA (the "Section 414(l) Amount"); plus (ii) for the period between the
Closing and the date such assets are transferred (the "Pension Transfer
Date"), an interest increment on the unpaid Section 414(l) Amount at the rate
equal to the yield on the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate as of the
Closing (such rate of interest, the "Interest Rate"); less (iii) any benefit
payments that are made from the Seller Pension Plan to each Pension
Participant for the period between the Closing and the Pension Transfer Date;
less (iv) any costs or expenses incurred by Seller in respect of Pension
Participant benefits of the Seller Pension Plan for the period between the
Closing and the Pension Transfer Date (the sum of (i) through (iv), the
"Pension Transfer Amount"). The transfer of the amount from the Seller Pension
Plan to the Parent Pension Plan shall be made in cash. The Parent Pension Plan
shall recognize and credit all service (including for purposes of benefit
accrual) of the Pension Participants credited under the Seller Pension Plan
with respect to the accrued benefits transferred. Following such transfer from
the Seller Pension Plan to the Parent Pension Plan, the Seller Pension Plan
shall have no liability to or with respect to any Pension Participant with respect to their accrued benefits under the Seller Pension Plan, and
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from all
liabilities, costs and expenses that may result to Seller or such Affiliates
or the Seller Pension Plan from any claim by or on behalf of any Pension
Participant for any benefit payable under the Seller Pension Plan. To the
extent that the amount of assets transferred to the Parent Pension Plan
pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) is less than the ABO (such as because of the
operation of Section 414(l) of the Code), Seller shall pay Parent the
difference in cash (plus interest at the Interest Rate for the period from the
Closing Date through the date of such payment) no later than the Pension
Transfer Deadline (or, if later, the date of final transfer pursuant to the
final sentence of this Section 6.3(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
asset transfer contemplated by this Section 6.3(b) is not made by the Pension
Transfer Deadline, then no later than the Pension Transfer Deadline, Seller
shall transfer to the Parent Pension Plan an amount in cash equal to 90% of
Seller's actuaries' reasonable estimate of the Pension Transfer Amount, and
Seller shall transfer the remaining amount in cash contemplated to be
transferred by this Section 6.3(b) (for the avoidance of doubt, including
interest at the Interest Rate for the period from the Closing Date through the
date of such transfer) within 90 days following the Closing Date (or such
later time as contemplated by Section 6.3(e)).

(c) Parent shall provide each former employee who was employed by the Company
as of his or her last day of employment and retired prior to the Closing and
is included on a list provided by Seller to Parent prior to the date hereof,
as such list is updated through Closing pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(iii)(y)(C)
(a "Retiree Welfare Participant") with benefits that are equivalent to those
benefits that would have been available to such Retiree Welfare Participant
had he or she remained covered under the Southern Company Services, Inc.
Healthcare Plan for Retirees, the Southern Company Services, Inc. Retiree Life
Insurance Plan or the Southern Company Services, Inc. Health and Welfare
Benefits Plan, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof, for the period
beginning immediately following the Closing and ending on the fifth
anniversary thereof (such period, the "Protection Period"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may change the benefits provided to Retiree Welfare
Participants during the Protection Period, as long as the replacement benefits
for each Retiree Welfare Participant has an actuarial value that is no less
than the actuarial value of the Seller Retiree Welfare Benefits for such
Retiree Welfare Participant and there is no reduction in the employer
contribution to such benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, Retiree Welfare
Participants who are grandfathered or capped immediately prior to Closing,
will continue to be considered grandfathered or capped, as applicable, during
the Protection Period, regardless of how such categories may be defined with
respect to Parent Retirees. After the expiration of the Protection Period,
Parent may continue to provide retiree health and welfare benefits to Retiree
Welfare Participants provided that Parent must treat Retiree Welfare
Participants consistent with the manner in which it treats similarly situated
(in terms of age and tenure of service (after giving effect to crediting of
service for service with the Company before the Closing)) retirees of Parent
and its Affiliates ("Parent Retirees"). As soon as practicable following the
Closing, the assets held in the Seller Welfare Trust (plus interest at the
Interest Rate for the period from the Closing Date through the date of such
transfer), shall be transferred to a voluntary employees beneficiary
association plan maintained by Parent (the "Parent Welfare Trust"). The Seller
Welfare Trust assets shall be transferred in cash. In addition, as soon as
practicable after the Closing, the assets held in the Seller 401(h) Account
shall be transferred to the Parent Pension Plan (plus interest at the Interest
Rate for the period from the Closing Date through the date of such transfer).
The Seller 401(h)

 Account assets shall be transferred in cash. For the Protection Period, Parent
shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, allow otherwise eligible Retiree
Welfare Participants to enroll in the retiree medical benefits contemplated
under this Section 6.3(c).

(d) With regard to The Southern Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(the "Seller SERP"), The Southern Company Supplemental Benefit Plan (the
"Seller SBP"), and the Southern Company Deferred Compensation Plan (the
"Seller DCP"), and pursuant to the Southern Company Change in Control Benefits
Protection Plan (the "Seller Change in Control Plan"), Seller shall fully vest
all Company Employees and all Pension Participants participating in the Seller
SERP, the Seller SBP, and the Seller DCP (collectively, the "Nonqualified
Benefits Participants"), and, as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Seller shall fund the Southern Company Deferred Compensation Trust
(the "Seller DC Trust") as required by the Seller Change in Control Plan with
respect to the Company Employees and all Pension Participants (subject to the
provisions of Section 6.3(e)). Effective as of the Closing, each Nonqualified
Benefits Participant shall cease to be a participant under the Seller SERP,
the Seller SBP, and the Seller DCP, and Parent shall provide each Nonqualified
Benefits Participant with the benefits that are accrued as of the Closing in
respect of service prior to the Closing on the payment terms that apply as of
the date hereof to such Nonqualified Benefits Participant under the Seller
SERP, the Seller SBP, and the Seller DCP (such benefits provided by Parent,
the "Parent SERP", the "Parent SBP", and the "Parent DCP"). Effective as of
the Closing, Parent shall establish a trust (the "Parent DC Trust")
substantially similar to the Seller DC Trust to hold assets to pay benefits to
Nonqualified Benefits Participants under the Parent SERP, the Parent SBP, and
the Parent DCP. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the assets and
the liabilities associated with the Nonqualified Benefits Participants in the
Seller DC Trust (plus interest at the Interest Rate for the period from the
Closing Date through the date of such transfer) shall be transferred to the
Parent DC Trust. The Seller DC Trust assets shall be transferred in cash.

(e) Seller shall cause its actuaries to provide Parent a report of the
actuaries' determinations under Sections 6.3(b), 6.3(c) and 6.3(d) within 90
days of the Closing Date and any back-up information reasonably required by
Parent to confirm the accuracy of such determinations. If Parent disputes the
accuracy of any calculation, Parent and Seller shall cooperate to identify the
basis for such disagreement and act in good faith to resolve such dispute. To
the extent that a dispute is unresolved after a 45-day period following
identification of such dispute, the calculations shall be verified by the
Chief Actuary, Retirement, of AON Hewitt (the "Chief Actuary"). The decision
of the Chief Actuary shall be final, binding and conclusive on Seller and
Parent. Seller and Parent shall share equally the costs of the Chief Actuary
incurred in connection with its determination pursuant to this Section 6.3(e).
Any amounts that the Chief Actuary determines are required to be paid as a
result of its determination under this Section 6.3(e) shall be paid within 30
days following the Chief Actuary's determination (plus interest at the
Interest Rate for the period from the Closing Date through the date of such
payment).

6.4 Labor and Employment Law Matters.

(a) Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate to
take all steps, on a timely basis, as are required under applicable Law or any
Labor Agreement to

 notify, consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact, terms or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each union, labor board,
employee group, or Governmental Entity where so required under applicable Law.
Seller shall regularly review with Parent the progress of the notifications,
consultations and negotiations with each union, labor board, employee group
and Governmental Entity regarding the effect, impact or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Seller shall provide to Parent on the Closing Date, a written list of all
terminations of Company Employees that occurred within the 90-day period prior
to the Closing Date. Parent will indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, from and
against any Liabilities that may be incurred by Seller under the WARN Act
arising at or after the Closing as a result of any action or omission of
Parent or its Affiliates occurring following the Closing.

6.5 Disability Employees. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the
employment of each employee of the Company who is on long-term disability
leave as of the Closing (a "Disability Employee") to be transferred to an
Affiliate of Seller other than the Company. Parent shall make an offer of
employment to any such Disability Employee who otherwise would have been a
Company Employee and who returns to active employment during the Continuation
Period. A Disability Employee shall not be considered a Company Employee
unless and until his or her employment commences with Parent or its
Affiliates. A Company Employee who is on short-term disability leave as of the
Closing who subsequently qualifies for long-term disability benefits shall
receive long-term disability benefits pursuant to the applicable Seller
Benefit Plan (under which Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all
Liabilities) and not pursuant to a long-term disability benefit plan of Parent
or its Affiliates; provided, however, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, promptly after receipt of any accounting statement
from Seller, for any long-term disability premium payments made by Seller or
its Affiliates with respect to each such Company Employee for the period from
Closing through the date on which such Company Employee's elimination period
ends (or if sooner, when such Company Employee returns to work and ceases to
be eligible for long-term disability benefits with respect to the disability
for which the Company Employee was on short-term disability leave as of the
Closing).

6.6 Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. This Article VI is included for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their respective transferees and permitted assigns
and does not and shall not create any right in any Person, including any
current or former employee of any Affiliate of Seller or the Company Employee,
who is not a Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement (express or implied)
(a) is intended to create or amend, or to require Parent or its Affiliates to
establish or maintain, any employee benefit plan or arrangement or (b) is
intended to confer upon any individual any right to employment for any period
of time, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment. No
current or former employee of any Affiliate of Seller or any Company Employee,
including any beneficiary or dependent of the foregoing, or any other Person
not a Party, shall be entitled to assert any claim against Parent, Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates under this Article VI.

6.7 Charitable Contributions. For a period of five years after the Closing
Date, Purchaser will cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to make charitable
disbursements only in the Company's retail service area.

 ARTICLE VII


TAX MATTERS

7.1 Tax Indemnification by Seller. Effective as of and after the Closing Date,
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company from and after the Closing Date)
(collectively, the "Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties") and hold each
Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (a) any Taxes (i) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(allocated in respect of a Straddle Tax Period in accordance with Section
7.4); (ii) of any member of the Seller Group (other than the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) for any period, (iii) of Seller or any other Person (other
than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or becomes liable (under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or under any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) as a
result of having joined as a member (or having been required to join as a
member) of any consolidated, combined, affiliated, aggregate or unitary group
prior to the Closing; (iv) of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes
liable as a transferee or successor, as a result of a Contract (other than
this Agreement) or otherwise by operation of Law; (v) arising out of or
resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement; (vi) for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 7.11 or (vii) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, other than Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.11; and (b) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any
item described in clause (a) of this Section 7.1 (any such Taxes described in
this Section 7.1, "Seller Indemnified Taxes"). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Seller Indemnified Taxes shall not include any
Taxes taken into account in determining the payment pursuant to Section 2.2 or
the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to Article II.

7.2 Tax Indemnification by Purchaser. Effective as of and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify the Seller
Group (collectively, the "Seller Tax Indemnified Parties") and hold each
Seller Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (a) any Taxes (i) of
the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period (allocated in respect of a
Straddle Tax Period in accordance with Section 7.4); (ii) arising out of or
resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Parent
contained in this Agreement; or (iii) for which Purchaser is responsible under
Section 7.11; and (b) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item
described in clause (a) of this Section 7.2, provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be responsible for any Seller Indemnified Taxes.

7.3 Survival. The indemnification obligations, covenants and agreements
pursuant to this Article VII shall survive the Closing until 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period (giving effect to
any extension thereof) with respect to the Tax item to which an indemnity
claim relates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnification obligation
with respect to any claim asserted pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 hereof in
good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and
in writing by notice from the

 indemnified Party to the indemnifying Party prior to the expiration date of
the survival period provided in the preceding sentence shall survive until
finally resolved.

7.4 Straddle Tax Periods. To the extent permitted or required by applicable
Law, the taxable year of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that begins
before and includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and
including) the Closing Date. To the extent the foregoing is not permitted or
required by applicable Law, for purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Tax Period, (a) Property Taxes of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the
Straddle Tax Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Tax Period, and
(b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if
such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and in
a manner consistent with past practices of the applicable entity (or of Seller
with respect to such entity); provided, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period.

7.5 Tax Returns.

(a) Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand (a "Combined Tax Return") and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any
Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return"). Seller shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed any Combined Tax Return and any Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed on or before the
Closing Date (taking into account any extensions). In the case of any such
Combined Tax Return and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return, Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with
past practices of the relevant entity (or of Seller with respect to such
entity). Seller shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
Purchaser all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions), or as early as possible
before such due date if, at the time of Closing, any such Tax Return is due in
less than 30 days, together with payment for any Seller Indemnified Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns not less than five Business Days before such
Taxes are due, and Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
such Tax Returns and timely pay any Taxes shown to be due with such Tax
Returns.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for
Straddle Tax Periods. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review and
comment a copy of any such Tax Return that is required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Tax Period
before the later of (i) as soon as reasonably practicable and (ii) 30 days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions) accompanied
by a statement calculating in reasonable detail Seller's indemnification obligation, if any,
pursuant to Section 7.1. If for any reason Seller does not agree with
Purchaser's calculation of its indemnification obligation, Seller shall notify
Purchaser of its disagreement within 15 days of receiving a copy of the Tax
Return and Purchaser's calculation (but in any event within a reasonable
period of time prior to the last date for timely filing such Tax Return).
Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle the
dispute with respect to such indemnification obligation promptly. If Seller
and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute prior to the due date of such
Tax Return (giving effect to valid extensions), Purchaser shall file the Tax
Return as originally prepared (but, reflecting any items on which Seller and
Purchaser have agreed), and the dispute resolution provisions of Section 7.15
shall apply.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Final
Ancillary Document, except to the extent such Tax Return relates solely to the
Company, (i) Seller shall not be required to provide any Person with any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return of Seller and (ii) Purchaser
shall not be required to provide any Person with any consolidated, combined,
affiliated, aggregate or unitary Tax Return (or copy thereof) of Purchaser.

7.6 Refunds and Credits. Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
or against any Seller Indemnified Taxes for which Seller is responsible under
Section 7.1. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or
against any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled
pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Tax Period shall be
equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 7.4 and the first two sentences of this
Section 7.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall (and Seller shall
not) be entitled to a refund or credit to the extent such refund or credit was
reflected in, reserved for or taken into account in the determination of the
payment pursuant to Section 2.2 or the Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to
Article II. Each Party actually receiving or realizing a refund or credit of
Taxes to which the other Party is entitled under this Section 7.6 shall pay,
or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the Party so entitled the amount of such
refund or credit (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes and
other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to the Party receiving such refund or
credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) in
readily available funds within 15 days of the actual receipt of the refund or
credit or the application of such refund or credit against amounts otherwise
payable. If any such refund or credit in respect of which a Party made a
payment to the other Party pursuant to this Section 7.6 is subsequently
disallowed or reduced, such other Party shall promptly repay the amount of
such refund or credit received, to the extent disallowed or reduced, to the
Party that made such payment, together with any interest, penalties or other
charges imposed thereon by the applicable taxing authority.

7.7 Tax Contests.

(a) If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party first
receiving notice of such Tax Claim shall provide prompt written notice thereof
to the other Party; provided, however, that the failure of such Party to give
such prompt notice shall not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations
under this Article VII, except to the extent that the other Party is
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for

 such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the taxing authority.

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Tax Period
(in each case, other than a Tax Proceeding described in Section 7.7(c)), the
Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own
expense, such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that (i) the Controlling
Party shall provide the non-Controlling Party with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Controlling
Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the
Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iv)
the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good
faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Tax Proceeding, and (vi) the Controlling Party shall not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, however,
that the Controlling Party shall not have any obligations (and the Non-
Controlling Party shall not have any rights) under the immediately foregoing
proviso with respect to any portion of such Tax Proceeding (and any actions,
written materials, meetings or conferences relating exclusively thereto) that
could not reasonably be expected to affect the liability of, or otherwise have
an adverse effect on, the Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Controlling Party" shall mean Seller in the case
of any Tax Proceeding of or with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or, in the case of any Tax Proceeding of or with respect to the
Company for any Straddle Tax Period, Seller if Seller and its Affiliates are
reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding; and "Non-Controlling Party" means whichever of Seller or Purchaser
is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding
with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return of Seller,
provided, however, that Seller shall notify Purchaser to the extent any such
Tax Proceeding involves any issues that would materially adversely affect the
Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties, shall keep Purchaser reasonably appraised
of the status of such Tax Proceeding with respect to such issues, shall
consult with Purchaser regarding such issues, shall consider any comments of
Purchaser in good faith and shall otherwise act in good faith with respect to
such issues.

7.8 Cooperation and Exchange of Information.

(a) Not more than 60 days after the receipt of a request from Purchaser,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Purchaser a
package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers,
requested by Purchaser to enable Purchaser to

 prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Seller shall prepare such package
completely and accurately, in good faith and in a manner consistent with
Seller's past practice.

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other
Party such cooperation, documentation and information as either of them
reasonably may request in (i) preparing and filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an
indemnity obligation under this Article VII or a right to refund of Taxes or
(iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation, documentation and
information shall include providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant
portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and
other relevant information that any such Party may possess. Each Party shall
make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its
own cost to provide an explanation of any documents or information so
provided.

(c) Each Party shall retain (to the extent in its possession or the possession
of its Affiliates) all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all
material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for its Tax periods ending on or prior to or including
the Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (y) eight years following the due date (without extension) for such
Tax Returns. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other documents
may dispose of them unless the other Party provides reasonable notice and
requests the opportunity to take possession of any portion of such Tax Returns
and other documents that relate solely to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at such other Party's own expense (provided, that any such notice
must in any event be made in writing at least 60 days prior to such
disposition).

7.9 Tax Sharing Agreements. On or before the Closing Date, the rights and
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to all Tax sharing
agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which such
entity, on the one hand, and any member of the Seller Group, on the other
hand, are parties, shall terminate, and neither any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall have any rights or obligations to each other after the
Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

7.10 Tax Treatment of Payments. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), Seller,
Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all
payments under this Article VII, Section 2.7 and Article X as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

7.11 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller shall pay, when due, and be
responsible for, one half of any sales, use, transfer, real property transfer,
registration, documentary, stamp, value added or similar Taxes imposed on or
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

 Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). The Party responsible under applicable Law for
filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and
timely file such Tax Returns (after providing the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to comment) and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the
other Party. Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any such Tax Returns or
other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for
exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes; provided, that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, neither Party nor
their respective Affiliates shall be required to file any claim for exemption
or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes, or any
claim for any reduction thereof, if such Party determines in its reasonable
discretion that the filing of such claim or any related action would have an
adverse effect on such Party or any of its Affiliates.

7.12 Timing of Payments. Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to
this Article VII shall be made within ten days after the indemnified Party
makes written demand upon the indemnifying Party, but in no case earlier than
five days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes or other amounts are
required to be paid to the applicable taxing authority.

7.13 Tax Matters Coordination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures
relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this Article VII, and the
provisions of Article X shall not apply.

7.14 Tax Elections. The Parties agree that no elections pursuant to Code
sections 336(e), 338(g) or 338(h)(10) will be made by Seller, any Affiliate of
Seller, Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, or the Company, with respect to
the Sale.

7.15 Tax Disputes.

(a) If any dispute between the Parties should arise regarding their respective
rights and obligations pursuant to this Article VII (a "Tax Dispute"), Seller
and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle such Tax
Dispute.

(b) If, within 30 days, such commercially reasonable efforts do not resolve
such Tax Dispute, Seller and Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to such Tax Dispute to Ernst and Young (the "Tax Referee").
Within 30 days after submission of such matters to the Tax Referee, the Tax
Referee shall make a final determination pursuant to such procedures as the
Tax Referee deems advisable. The Tax Referee shall resolve the Tax Dispute
according to such procedures as the Tax Referee deems advisable and shall
furnish written notice to the Parties of its resolution of any such Tax
Dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than 45 days after
its acceptance of the matter for resolution. Any such resolution by the Tax
Referee shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and if so
consistent shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties.

(c) The fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Tax Referee shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand. During the review by the Tax Referee, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates (including, in the
case of Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries) and its and their
respective employees, accountants and other representatives to, each make
available to the Tax Referee interviews with such personnel and such information, books
and records and work papers, as may be reasonably requested by the Tax Referee
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 7.15; provided, that the
accountants of Seller or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work
papers available to the Tax Referee except in accordance with such
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Tax Referee
has signed a customary nondisclosure agreement relating to such access to work
papers.

7.16 Purchaser Tax Acts. None of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall,
following the Closing (including the portion of the Closing Date after the
Closing), other than an action taken in the ordinary course of business,
required by applicable Law, or contemplated hereunder, take any of the
following actions, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed): (a) make any Tax
election, or change in tax accounting period or method, with an effective date
on or prior to the Closing Date or during a Straddle Tax Period, (b) amend any
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period, (c) initiate
or execute any voluntary disclosure agreement or similar agreement with any
Tax authority with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (d) extend the statute of limitations with respect to
any Tax Return filed with respect to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Tax Period, in the case of clauses (c) and (d), that could
reasonably be expected to create any Tax obligation for which Seller would be
liable under this Agreement. Upon the request of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand, and Purchaser and its
Affiliates on the other hand, shall cooperate in good faith to determine, in
advance of any proposed action by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that may
be described in this Section 7.16, the amount of any income or gain that would
be described in this Section 7.16 as a result of such proposed action.

been fulfilled or are capable of being fulfilled at the Closing, then the
Outside Date will be December 31, 2019, and; provided, further, that if the
Outside Date would otherwise occur during the pendency of the notice period contemplated by Section 9.3(a)(ii)(B), Section
9.3(b)(ii)(B), or clause (y) of the proviso to Section 9.3(b) then the Outside
Date shall be automatically extended until the expiration of such notice
period;

(ii) Seller (in the case of a termination by Purchaser) or Parent or Purchaser
(in the case of a termination by Seller) shall have breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and
such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) (in the case of termination by
Purchaser) or Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) (in the case of termination by Seller),
and (B) (1) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (2) if
capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured prior to
the earlier of (x) 60 days after the date on which Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, receives notice of such alleged breach or failure to perform from
the party seeking termination, stating such party's intention to terminate
this agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) and the basis for such
termination and (y) the Outside Date; provided, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any
Party if such Party is then in breach in any material respect of any of its
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement;

(iii) the condition in Section 8.1(a) is not satisfied and the Legal Restraint
giving rise to the non-satisfaction shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to any Party if such Party shall
have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement with respect to such
Legal Restraint, including Section 5.5; or

(iv) any Governmental Entity that must grant a Required Regulatory Approval
shall have denied such grant, and such denial shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(b)(iv) shall not be available to any Party if such Party shall
have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement with respect to such
consent, authorization or approval, including Section 5.5.

9.2 Notice of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice
of such termination shall be given by the terminating Party to the other.

9.3 Termination Fees.

(a) Seller Termination Fee. In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to (A) Section 9.1(b)(i) at a time when only the conditions (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but which conditions would be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date
were the date of such termination) in Section 8.1(a) (but only if the
applicable Legal Restraint relates to a Required Regulatory Approval or is in
connection with the assertion by a Governmental Entity that an approval (other
than the Required Regulatory Approvals) is required from such Governmental
Entity) or Section 8.1(b) have not been satisfied, (B) Section 9.1(b)(iii)
(but only if the applicable Legal Restraint relates to a Required Regulatory
Approval or is in connection with the assertion by a Governmental Entity that an approval (other than the Required Regulatory Approvals) is required
from such Governmental Entity) or (C) Section 9.1(b)(iv) and (ii) the
conditions in Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) would have been satisfied but
for (A) Seller's failure to agree or to commit to undertake a Seller
Burdensome Condition (other than pursuant to clause (i) of the definition
thereof) or (B) Seller's failure to perform in any material respect its
obligations under Section 5.5 (written notice of which failure to perform was
provided by Purchaser to Seller at least 30 days prior to the termination of
this Agreement), then, subject to Section 9.3(c), Seller will by way of
compensation, pay to Purchaser an amount equal to $100,000,000 (the "Seller
Termination Fee") by wire transfer (to an account designated by Purchaser) of
immediately available funds (x) prior to or concurrently with such termination
in the event of a termination by Seller or (y) no later than five Business
Days following such termination in the event of a termination by Purchaser. In
no event will Seller be required to pay the Seller Termination Fee other than
in the instance described in this Section 9.3(a) and in no event will Seller
be required to pay the Seller Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The
Parties acknowledge that the Seller Termination Fee will not constitute a
penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Purchaser and Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Except
in the case of Willful Breach or Actual Fraud, in any circumstance in which
Purchaser receives the Seller Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3(a),
receipt of the Seller Termination Fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Purchaser, Parent and their respective Affiliates against Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives for any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
upon receipt of the Seller Termination Fee, none of the foregoing Persons will
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

(b) Purchaser Termination Fee. In the event that: (i) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to (A) Section 9.1(b)(i) at a time when only the
conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination) in Section
8.1(a) (but only if the applicable Legal Restraint relates to a Required
Regulatory Approval or is in connection with the assertion by a Governmental
Entity that an approval (other than the Required Regulatory Approvals) is
required from such Governmental Entity) or Section 8.1(b) have not been
satisfied, (B) Section 9.1(b)(iii) (but only if the applicable Legal Restraint
relates to a Required Regulatory Approval or is in connection with the
assertion by a Governmental Entity that an approval (other than the Required
Regulatory Approvals) is required from such Governmental Entity) or (C)
Section 9.1(b)(iv); and (ii) the conditions in Section 8.1(a) and Section
8.1(b) failed to be satisfied other than as a result of (A) Seller's failure
to agree or to commit to undertake a Seller Burdensome Condition or (B)
Seller's failure to perform in any material respect its obligations under
Section 5.5 (written notice of which failure to perform was provided by
Purchaser to Seller at least 30 days prior to the termination of this
Agreement), then, subject to Section 9.3(c), Parent will pay, or cause to be
paid, by way of compensation to Seller an amount equal to $100,000,000 (the
"Regulatory Termination Fee"); provided, however, that, if this Agreement has
been terminated in the circumstances set forth in the preceding clause (i) and
the conditions in Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) would have been satisfied
but for

 (x) Purchaser's failure to agree or to commit to undertake a Purchaser
Burdensome Condition or (y) Purchaser's failure to perform in any material
respect its obligations under in Section 5.5 (written notice of which failure
to perform was provided by Seller to Purchaser at least 30 days prior to the
termination of this Agreement), then, subject to Section 9.3(c), Parent will
pay, or shall cause to be paid, by way of compensation to Seller an amount
equal to $200,000,000 (the "Purchaser Termination Fee"). If the Regulatory
Termination Fee or the Purchaser Termination Fee becomes due and payable in
accordance with this Section 9.3(b), then such fee shall be paid in each case
by wire transfer (to an account designated by Seller) of immediately available
funds (I) prior to or concurrently with such termination in the event of a
termination by Purchaser or (II) no later than five Business Days following
such termination in the event of a termination by Seller. In no event will
Parent be required to pay the Purchaser Termination Fee or Regulatory
Termination Fee other than in the circumstances described in this Section
9.3(b) and in no event will Parent be required to pay both the Purchaser
Termination Fee and the Regulatory Termination Fee. In the event that both the
Purchaser Termination Fee and the Regulatory Termination Fee are payable
pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), then Seller shall only be entitled to
receive, and Purchaser shall only be required to pay, the Purchaser
Termination Fee. In addition, Parent shall not be required to pay the
Purchaser Termination Fee or the Regulatory Termination Fee, as the case may
be, on more than one occasion. The Parties acknowledge that each of the
Purchaser Termination Fee and the Regulatory Termination Fee will not
constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Seller for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Except in the case of Willful Breach or Actual Fraud, in any
circumstance in which Seller receives the Purchaser Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Termination Fee, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section
9.3(b), receipt of such fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives against Purchaser,
Parent and their respective Affiliates and Representatives for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and upon receipt of the Purchaser Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Termination Fee, none of the foregoing Persons will have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise.

(c) Anything to the contrary in Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.3(b)
notwithstanding: (i) Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive, and Seller
shall not be obligated to pay, the Seller Termination Fee in the event that
(A) Purchaser has failed to agree or to commit to undertake a Purchaser
Burdensome Condition or (B) Purchaser has failed to perform in any material
respect any of its obligations under Section 5.5 and the conditions in Section
8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) would have been satisfied but for such failure; and
(ii) Seller shall not be entitled to receive, and Purchaser shall not be
obligated to pay, the Purchaser Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee
in the event that (A) Seller has failed to agree or to commit to undertake a
Seller Burdensome Condition or (B) Seller has failed to perform in any
material respect any of its obligations under Section 5.5 and the conditions
in Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) would have been satisfied but for such
failure.

9.4 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement
shall terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall be no
liability on the part of any Party, except as set forth in Section 9.3 and the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that termination
of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from liability for Willful
Breach or Actual Fraud. For purposes hereof, "Willful Breach" shall mean a
breach that is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act
undertaken by the breaching Party with the knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would cause the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated; provided that, without
limiting the meaning of Willful Breach, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
any failure by any Party to consummate the Sale after the applicable
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, and which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at
the time of such failure to consummate the Sale) shall constitute a Willful
Breach of this Agreement by such Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) in the
event that all applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII
have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, and which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the
Sale), but Purchaser fails to close for any reason, such failure to close
shall be considered a Willful Breach by Purchaser and (b) Parent and Purchaser
acknowledge that the availability or unavailability of financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have no effect on
Purchaser's obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the provisions of Section 3.20, Section 4.9, Section 5.3(c),
Section 5.7, Section 9.3, Article XI, and this Section 9.4 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

9.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, either Seller or
Purchaser may (but shall not be required to) (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by the other
Party pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party
contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party granting such
extension or waiver sent in accordance with Section 11.3 and referencing this
Section of the Agreement.

ARTICLE X 

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.

(a) The Seller Fundamental Representations and Purchaser Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing until the 12-month anniversary
thereof. All other representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall expire upon the Closing.

(b) The covenants and agreements to be performed at or prior to Closing
contained in Sections 5.1 (other than Section 5.1(a)(iii)(y)(I)), 5.2, 5.3,
5.6, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.16 shall survive the Closing until the 12-month
anniversary thereof, and written notice of a claim for breach of such covenant
or agreement must be given by Purchaser to Seller or by Seller to Purchaser,
as applicable, in accordance with the provisions hereof on or prior to such
12-

 month anniversary, and any other covenant and agreement contained herein that
by its terms is to be performed solely at or prior to Closing shall expire at
the Closing. Any covenant and agreement to be performed, in whole or in part,
after the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with its terms.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in connection with this
Agreement in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching Party to the
breaching Party prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period
shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant
representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until finally
resolved.

10.2 Indemnification by Seller.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article X and except with respect to
Closing Payment Adjustments (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
II) and indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by
Article VII), effective as of and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses incurred
or suffered by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or
related to:

(i) any breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation, at and as of the
Closing as though made at and as of the Closing, or any breach of the
representation and warranty made in Section 3.16;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing; and

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement to be performed, in whole or in part, after the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary (except with respect
to indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
VII)): (i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified
Party for, any Losses pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii), solely to the extent
such Losses arise out of or relate to a breach of Section 5.1, until the
aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Losses under Section
10.2(a)(ii) exceeds $20,000,000 (the "Threshold"), after which Seller shall be
obligated for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' Losses under Section
10.2(a)(ii) for the full amount of such Losses, from the first dollar thereof
and without regard to the Threshold; and (ii) the cumulative indemnification
obligations of Seller under Section 10.2(a) shall in no event exceed, in
aggregate, the Purchase Price (the "Cap").

10.3 Indemnification by Parent.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article X and except with respect to
Closing Payment Adjustments (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
II) and indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by
Article VII), effective as of and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or related
to:

(i) any breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representations, at and as of the
Closing as though made at and as of the Closing, contained in Article IV;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing; and

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement to be performed, in whole or in part, after the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary (except with respect
to indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
VII)), the cumulative indemnification obligations of Parent and the Company
under Section 10.3(a) shall in no event exceed, in aggregate, the Cap.

10.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Person entitled to receive indemnification
under this Agreement (an "Indemnitee") receives notice of any demand or claim
by any Person who is neither a Party nor an Affiliate of a Party (a "Third
Party Claim") which has or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder, or for which the Indemnitee may claim a right to
indemnification hereunder from the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party"), the
Indemnitee will promptly give written notice (a "Third Party Claim Notice") of
such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party. Any such Third Party Claim
Notice shall (i) describe the nature, facts and circumstances of the Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) state the estimated amount of the
indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee, if
practicable, (iii) state the method and computation thereof and (iv) contain
specific reference to the provision or provisions of this Agreement in respect
of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. The Indemnitee
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information known to it
or in its possession with respect to the Third Party Claim as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and
expense, will have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnitee within 30
days (or such earlier time as may be required by the nature of the Third Party
Claim) of receiving a Third Party Claim Notice, to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee;
provided, that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at
its expense, and the Indemnitee may assume control of the defense of the Third
Party Claim, if at the Indemnifying Party's expense (i) upon the advice of
Indemnitee's counsel, a conflict of interest exists (or would reasonably be
expected to arise) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and Indemnitee in connection with a
Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute
the defense of the Third Party Claim or (iii) such Third Party Claim (A) seeks
non-monetary relief or (B) involves criminal or quasi criminal allegations,
and, provided further, that if the aggregate dollar amount of the Third Party
Claim, together with all other Third Party Claims of which the Indemnifying Party is aware or has received Third Party Claim Notices, and all costs and
expenses reasonably estimated to be incurred in connection with the defense
thereof, would exceed the Cap, the Indemnitee may, at its option, and to the
extent in excess of the Cap at its sole cost and expense, assume the defense
of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice upon written notice to the
Indemnifying Party within 15 days of receiving a Third Party Claim Notice.

(b) Defense of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.4(a), the Indemnifying
Party will diligently pursue such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed with respect to such defense. The Indemnitee shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel, including making available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnitee's possession or
under the Indemnitee's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will have the right to participate in
such defense, including appointing separate counsel, but the costs of such
participation shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee. Subject to Section
10.4(a), the Indemnifying Party will, in consultation with the Indemnitee,
make all decisions and determine all actions to be taken with respect to the
defense and settlement of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
provided that it will not be deemed to be unreasonable for an Indemnitee to
withhold its consent if (A) such payment, compromise, settlement or
disposition does not involve solely the payment of money, (B) such payment,
compromise, settlement or disposition does not involve solely the payment of
money by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the Indemnitee, (C) such
payment, compromise, settlement or disposition involves a finding or admission
of violation of any Law, Order or Permit or rights of any Person by the
Indemnitee or its Affiliates, or (D) such payment, compromise, settlement or
disposition does not contain an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from
the subject matter of such payment, compromise, settlement or disposition. In
no event will the Indemnifying Party have authority to agree, without the
consent of the Indemnitee, to any relief binding on the Indemnitee other than
the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the
Indemnitee.

(c) Failure to Assume Defense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend
such Third Party Claim, fails to timely notify the Indemnitee in writing of
its election to defend, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all indemnifiable Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitee
shall not pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Direct Losses. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an indemnifiable
Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Loss") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, (i)
describing the nature, facts and circumstances of such indemnifiable Loss in
reasonable detail, (ii) stating the amount of the indemnifiable Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee, if practicable, (iii) stating the
method and computation thereof, and (iv) containing specific reference to the provision or provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. The Indemnitee shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to the
Direct Loss as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, including permitting
reasonable access to books, records, and personnel, in connection with
determining the validity of any claim for indemnification by the Indemnitee
and in otherwise resolving such matters. The Indemnifying Party will have a
period of 30 Business Days within which to respond to such claim of a Direct
Loss. If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, or does not respond within
such period, the Indemnitee may seek enforcement of its rights to
indemnification under this Agreement.

(e) Delay. A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 10.4
will affect the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such notice
was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no claim for indemnification first made after the expiration of the
applicable survival period with respect to the representation, warranty or
covenant on which such claim is based set forth in Section 10.1 will be valid
and any such claim shall be deemed time-barred.

10.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to the matters covered by Sections
2.5 through 2.7 (which shall be governed exclusively by such sections) and
with respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed
exclusively by Article VII) and except for the Parties' right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief pursuant to Section 11.13, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of
Sections 10.2 and 10.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties
for any Liabilities or Losses (including any Liabilities or Losses from claims
for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or
otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of, or in connection with the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply
with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed,
or complied with, under this Agreement (but excluding the Form Ancillary
Documents). In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser hereby
waive, on behalf of themselves and the other Seller Indemnified Parties and
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, respectively, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action
(including rights of contribution, rights of recovery arising out of or
relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to the
Company, this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), or the transactions contemplated hereby, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against the other arising under or based upon any Law, common law, or
otherwise.

10.6 Additional Indemnification Provisions. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Article X, all Losses shall be
net of indemnity proceeds that have been recovered by the indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that if indemnification
proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the indemnified Party
subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of an indemnification payment in
satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall
be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent that the
indemnification payment made exceed the Losses incurred), and the indemnified
Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to seek recovery under all indemnity provisions covering such Losses
to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification hereunder.

10.7 Limitation on Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law,
no Party will be liable to the other Party, either in contract or in tort, for
any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages of the
other Party, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits
or income, diminution in value or loss of business reputation or opportunity,
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not
the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other Party in
advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party, and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits," "multiple of cash flow," "multiple of
assets" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the
amount of any indemnifiable Losses. The exclusion of consequential,
incidental, indirect, special, and punitive damages as set forth in the
preceding sentence does not apply to any such damages actually paid to a third
parties by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, in connection with Losses
that may be indemnified pursuant to this Article X after Closing.

10.8 Mitigation. Each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder, and no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any Losses to the extent they arise out of or result from the
indemnified Party's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
such Losses.

11.4 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller, Purchaser and Parent and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by
Seller, Purchaser or Parent, without the prior written consent of Seller (in
the case of an assignment by Purchaser or Parent) or of Purchaser (in the case
of assignment by Seller). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Seller,
Parent and Purchaser shall be permitted to assign its respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement, individually or collectively, to one or more
of its wholly owned, direct or indirect Subsidiaries with prior written notice
to the other Parties; provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve
a Party of, or constitute a discharge of, any of such Party's liabilities and
obligations under this Agreement.

11.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Sections 5.13, 5.18, 7.1, 7.2,
10.2 and 10.3 in each case which are intended to benefit, and to be
enforceable by, the parties specified therein, this Agreement, together with
the Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, are not
intended to confer in or on behalf of any Person not a Party (and their
successors and assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies
with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof.

11.6 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or not, all legal
and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such costs and expenses unless expressly otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement.

11.7 Governing Law. This Agreement (as well as any claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws rules thereof that
would otherwise require the Laws of another jurisdiction to apply.

11.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

11.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement will be a valid and binding agreement of
the Parties only if and when it is fully executed and delivered by Seller,
Purchaser and Parent, and until such execution and delivery no legal
obligation will be created by virtue hereof. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (and, if the Closing
occurs, the Final Ancillary Documents), together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto and thereto and the certificates and instruments delivered
hereunder or in accordance herewith, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding of Seller, Purchaser and Parent in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements (and, if the Closing occurs, the Final Ancillary Documents) supersede all prior agreements and understandings between Seller,
on the one hand, and Purchaser or Parent, on the other hand, with respect to
the matters contemplated hereby. Neither this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement nor any Ancillary Agreement (nor, if the Closing occurs, the Form
Ancillary Documents) shall be deemed to contain or imply any restriction,
covenant, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking of Seller,
Purchaser or Parent with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby other than those expressly set forth herein or therein or in any
document required to be delivered hereunder or thereunder.

11.10 Delivery. This Agreement, and any certificates and instruments delivered
hereunder or in accordance herewith, may be executed in multiple counterparts
(each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument). Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (.pdf) form, or by any other electronic means intended to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

11.12 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent
irrevocably agrees that any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by the other Party (or any of their respective successors or
assigns) shall be brought and determined in any state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware, and each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent agrees
not to commence any Action relating thereto except in the courts described
above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent further waives any argument
that such service is insufficient. Each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

11.13 Specific Performance. Each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of Seller, Purchaser and
Parent hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

11.14 Disclosure Generally. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the Seller Disclosure Letter or in this Agreement, the information and
disclosures contained in any Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosed and incorporated by reference with respect to any other
representation or warranty of Seller for which applicability of such
information and disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that
any item of information is disclosed in any Seller Disclosure Letter shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall
not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

11.15 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Each Party agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that Baker Botts L.L.P., Balch and
Bingham LLP, Beggs and Lane RLLP, Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, Jones Day and
Troutman Sanders LLP may serve as counsel to Seller and the Company in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and that, following consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, Baker Botts L.L.P., Balch
and Bingham LLP, Beggs and Lane RLLP, Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, Jones Day and
Troutman Sanders LLP (or any successors) may serve as counsel to Seller or any
Affiliate or representative of Seller, in connection with any Action or
obligation arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby notwithstanding such prior representation of the Company, and each
Party consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom.

11.16 Privilege. Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, and its and its
Affiliates' respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally acknowledges and agrees that all attorney-client privileged
communications between Seller, the Company and their respective current or
former Affiliates or representatives and their counsel, including Baker Botts
L.L.P., Balch and Bingham LLP, Beggs and Lane RLLP, Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP,
Jones Day and Troutman Sanders LLP, made before the consummation of the
Closing to the extent relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby which, immediately before
the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged communications and would not be
subject to disclosure to Purchaser (or would otherwise not be disclosable to
Purchaser without losing any such right of privilege) in connection with any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or otherwise, shall
continue after the Closing to be privileged communications with such counsel
and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company) shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that
the 

privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Purchaser or the Company
or on any other grounds.
