promptly reimburse Buyer for same and (y) for all periods of time from and
after the Effective Time, shall be the sole obligation of Buyer, and Buyer
shall promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for same.

 

 _3.3 Purchase Price Adjustment._

 

(a) The Base Purchase Price to be paid at Closing will be adjusted upward by
an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the positive amount, if any, or
downward by an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the shortfall amount,
if any, of Estimated Net Working Capital in comparison to Target Net Working
Capital.

 

(b) The Base Purchase Price to be paid at Closing will be adjusted upward by
an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate amount of any
capital expenditures (i) approved by Buyer in writing in accordance with this
Agreement after the date hereof and (ii) paid by the WTP Partnership after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer not less than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date Sellers estimate of the Net Working Capital
attributable to the WTP Partnership Interests as of Closing (based upon the
definitions of Current Assets and Current

 



-8-  Liabilities and using the determinations, calculations and methodology set
forth on the Sample Balance Sheet) (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ").
If Buyer has any questions or disagreements regarding Sellers calculation of
the Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer shall contact Seller at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and in such case Seller and Buyer
shall in good faith attempt to resolve any disagreements. If Buyer and Seller
do not agree on the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital or changes to
the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be paid at
the Closing assuming that the Estimated Net Working Capital is equal to the
Target Net Working Capital as of Closing.

(d) No later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date (or such later date
as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller Buyers calculation of the Net Working Capital attributable to the WTP
Partnership Interests as of Closing (based upon the definitions of Current
Assets and Current Liabilities and using the determinations, calculations and
methodology set forth on the Sample Balance Sheet) (the " _Final Net Working
Capital_ "). Buyer and Seller shall promptly provide to each other all
documents reasonably requested by the other to verify any of the items set
forth in the Final Net Working Capital. Each of Seller and Buyer and their
respective representatives shall be entitled to such access during normal
business hours to all books and records of the other Party as they may
reasonably request for the purpose of this Section 3.3(d). Seller shall have
the right for 30 calendar days following receipt of the Final Net Working
Capital to object to the proposed calculation of the Final Net Working
Capital. Any objection made by Seller shall be made in writing and shall set
forth the grounds for such objection in reasonable detail. Seller shall be
deemed to have waived any rights to object to any aspect of the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital to the extent Seller does not deliver written
objections to Buyer with respect to such aspects within such 30 calendar day
period. To the extent Seller delivers written objections within such 30
calendar day period, then Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to
resolve such objections. If, at the end of a 15 calendar day period from the
date of delivery of any objection by Seller or such longer period as may be
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, there are any objections that remain in
dispute, then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted for
resolution to the accounting firm of Ernst and Young LLP or such other
accounting firm as the Parties may mutually select (the " _Accounting
Arbitrator_ "). Each of Seller and Buyer agree not to engage, or agree to
engage, the Accounting Arbitrator to perform any services other than as
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto until the Final Net Working Capital has
been finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.3(d). Each Party agrees to
execute, if requested by the Accounting Arbitrator, a reasonable engagement
letter and to provide such indemnity and other agreements as the Accounting
Arbitrator may require in connection with or as a condition to such
engagement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall determine the Final Net Working
Capital as promptly as reasonably practicable after the objections that remain
in dispute are submitted to it, but in any event within 30 calendar days
after such objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If any
objections are submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution, (i) each
of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the Accounting Arbitrator and the other
Party such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Accounting Arbitrator may request and are reasonably
available to that Party (or its independent public accountants) and will
be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accounting Arbitrator any
material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to
discuss such determination

 



-9-  with the Accounting Arbitrator, (ii) the Accounting Arbitrator shall not
assign a value to any item in dispute that is greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by Seller or Buyer or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by Seller or Buyer and (iii) the determination by the
Accounting Arbitrator of the Final Net Working Capital, as set forth in a
written notice delivered to both Buyer and Seller by the Accounting
Arbitrator, shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and, absent manifest error, shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof. Buyer
and Seller shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs in connection
with any such objection; provided, that Buyer and Seller shall each bear one-
half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator. Seller and Buyer
shall promptly, and in any event within five Business Days after the final
determination of the matter submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator for
resolution, pay to the Accounting Arbitrator the amount of fees and expenses
of the Accounting Arbitrator payable by Seller and Buyer pursuant to the
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Accounting Arbitrator and procedures set forth herein shall be
the sole method for resolving any disputes regarding the Final Net Working
Capital or the provisions of this Section 3.3.

(e) Following the final determination of the Final Net Working Capital
pursuant to this Section 3.3:

(i) if (A) an adjustment was made to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant
to Section 3.3(a) and (B) the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant
to this Section 3.3 is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then an
amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of such shortfall shall be paid by
Seller to Buyer;

(ii) if (A) an adjustment was made to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant
to Section 3.3(a) and (B) the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant
to this Section 3.3 is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then an
amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of such excess shall be paid by Buyer to
Seller; or

(iii) if (A) no adjustment was made to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant
to Section 3.3(a) and (B) the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant
to this Section 3.3 is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, then an
amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the difference between the Final Net
Working Capital and Target Net Working Capital shall be paid by Buyer to
Seller, or (C) the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to this
Section 3.3 is less that the Target Net Working Capital, then an amount equal
to twenty percent (20%) of the difference between the Target Net Working
Capital and the Final Net Working Capital shall be paid by Seller to Buyer.

 

The amount, if any, payable as provided in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above
shall be paid promptly (but in any event within five Business Days of the
determination of such amount) by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to an account designated by the
applicable payee.

 



-10- (f) The provisions of this Section 3.3 shall apply in such a manner so as not
to give the components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of
adjustment and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as
described in the Sample Balance Sheet, the Parties covenant and agree that no
amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either
as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculation of the
aggregate amount of any capital expenditures or Final Net Working Capital or
any component of any of the foregoing, or any other calculated amount
pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either
as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be overstated or
understated for purposes of such calculation. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that, if there is a conflict between a determination, calculation or
methodology set forth in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained
in this Agreement, as applicable, on the one hand, and those provided by
GAAP, on the other hand, (i) the determination, calculation or methodology
set forth in the Sample Balance Sheet or the definitions contained in this
Agreement, as applicable, shall control to the extent that the matter is
included in the Sample Balance Sheet as a line item or specific adjustment or
expressly provided for in the definitions contained in this Agreement or
otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement and (ii) the determination,
calculation or methodology prescribed by GAAP shall otherwise control.

_3.4 Deposit._

 

(a) Contemporaneously with or prior to the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
will deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds with the Escrow
Agent an amount equal to 10% of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Deposit_ ").
The Deposit will be held by the Escrow Agent in a segregated interest-bearing
escrow account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If
Closing occurs, the Deposit (and all interest earned thereon) will be applied
toward the Purchase Price and released to Seller at Closing.

 

(b) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(a) or Section
11.3(c), and, in either case, Buyer does not also have the right at that time
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(a), Section 11.3(b) or
Section 11.3(e), then Seller will be entitled to receive the Deposit
(including all interest earned thereon), free of any claims by Buyer with
respect thereto.

(c) If (i) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(a),
Section 11.3(b) or Section 11.3(e); (ii) Seller terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.3(a) or Section 11.3(c), and, in either case, Buyer has
the right at that time to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.3(a), Section 11.3(b) or Section 11.3(e); or (iii) either Party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(d) or the Parties mutually agree to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.3(f), then Buyer will
be entitled to the prompt return of the Deposit (including all interest
earned thereon), free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto.

 

(d) Seller and Buyer agree to timely provide a joint instruction notice to the
Escrow Agent regarding the disposition of the Deposit (including all interest
earned thereon) in accordance with this Section 3.4.

 



-11- _3.5 Allocation of Purchase Price._

 

Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree, within 90
days after the Closing Date, upon the allocation of the Purchase Price among
the interests in Holdings and Holdings II and the underlying interests in the
WTP Partnership for financial accounting purposes, federal income tax
purposes, and any applicable state Tax purposes. Buyer and Seller shall file
any related Tax forms required by any Governmental Entity on a timely basis
consistent with such allocation or adjustments thereto. Buyer and Seller shall
not take any position on their respective federal or applicable state income
tax returns or otherwise that is inconsistent with such allocation as so
agreed to or adjusted between the Parties. In the event that any adjustment is
required to be made to the allocation of the Purchase Price initially
determined by the Parties in accordance with the foregoing as a result of any
adjustment to the consideration paid hereunder pursuant to Section 3.3, the
Parties agree to consult in good faith on such adjustment and how such
adjustment should be reflected in the allocation hereunder. If, contrary to
the intent of the Parties hereto as expressed in this Section 3.5, any
Governmental Entity makes or proposes an allocation inconsistent with any
allocation agreed to by the Parties, the Parties shall cooperate with each
other in good faith to contest such Governmental Entitys allocation (or
proposed allocation); provided, however, that, after consultation with the
Party adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the
other Party hereto may file such protective claims or Tax Returns as may be
reasonably required to protect its interests; provided further, that neither
Seller or any of its Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be
obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price
by a Governmental Entity. If the Parties are unable to agree on the allocation
of the Purchase Price as contemplated above, then each Party may file any
related Tax forms required by any Governmental Entity in a manner consistent
with such Partys proposed allocation.

be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Seller has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby to which it is or will
be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The

-13-  and the performance of the transactions contemplated hereby by Seller have
been duly and validly approved by all requisite action necessary on behalf of
Seller. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and to general
principles of equity (" _Creditors  Rights_"). At the Closing all documents
required hereunder to be executed and delivered by Seller will have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by Seller and will constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance
with their terms, subject to Creditors Rights.

 

 _5.3 No Violation or Consent._

 

The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or any other documents
required hereunder to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated

of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld), and expeditiously
settle or prosecute such proceeding to a final conclusion, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any such defense or
settlement at its own cost and with its own counsel, and (iii) if requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Claim that the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to the
Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the
Claim, or any cross complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or conduct
the defense of the Indemnified Party in the event (a) the Indemnified Party
is advised by legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party
that a conflict of interest is reasonably likely to result under applicable
rules of professional responsibility if the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party were represented by the same counsel, (b) a court in which
the Claim is pending determines that a conflict of interest exists such that
the Indemnifying Partys counsel is prohibited by the court or otherwise
unable to represent the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, (c) the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party are or become adverse parties in the
Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume
the defense of such y Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, or (d) the Indemnifying Party and/or its counsel fails to
actively and diligently conduct such defense of the Indemnified Party.

To the extent the Indemnifying Party elects not to or is otherwise not
entitled to assume and conduct the defense of any Claim as provided above,
the Indemnified Party shall, at the cost and for the account of the
Indemnifying Party, assume the defense of such Claim. In such case, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right with respect to any Claim for which it
is assuming the defense to choose counsel and make decisions regarding any
such proceeding, provided that it shall keep the Indemnifying Party advised
with respect thereto. Subject to Section 12.1(f) below, the Indemnifying Party
shall be bound by any and all rulings, judgments, compromises and settlements
reached by the Indemnified Party in good faith.

 



-31- (e) _Indemnity Claim Cooperation._ If a Party becomes an Indemnified Party, it
shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate in all reasonable
respects with the Indemnifying Party and permit the Indemnifying Party
reasonable access to the Indemnified Partys books, records, facilities and
employees for the purpose of permitting the Indemnifying Party to perform its
obligations under this Section 12.1; provided, however, that the Indemnified
Party shall not be required to disclose to the Indemnifying Party any
documents or correspondence covered by the attorney client privilege or the
work product doctrine, except pursuant to a joint defense agreement. To the
extent that any documents or correspondence are covered by the attorney client
privilege or the work product doctrine, the Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party seeks to protect such
privilege with respect to third parties. The Indemnified Party shall disclose
to the Indemnifying Party the non-privileged contents of any such documents
or correspondence. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith a joint defense
agreement with respect to the matter that is the subject of the privileged
communication or work product.

(f) _Settlement of Claims._ No third party Claim may be made the subject of a
consent decree or otherwise settled or compromised without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. No consent decree or other settlement or compromise of any such
Claim involving (i) the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to any
criminal charge, (ii) any admission of responsibility, liability or
wrongdoing, or (iii) involving or affecting Buyers ownership or use of the
Membership Interests or WTP Partnership Interest shall require the
prior consent of Buyer in its sole discretion.

(g) _Adjustment to Purchase Price._ The Parties agree that any payments made
pursuant to this Section 12.1 shall be treated for all tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by any Legal
Requirements.

 

 _12.2 Exclusive Remedy._

 

(a) If Closing occurs, Article 12 shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties
against each other for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement; provided that
nothing herein shall limit in any way any Partys remedies in respect of fraud
or willful breach or misconduct by the other Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances described in
Section 3.4(c), then (subject to Section 12.2(a) with respect to Buyers
rights to pursue Claims for fraud or willful breach or misconduct) Buyer shall
be entitled to pursue (at any time prior to termination of this Agreement):
(x) the right to receive the Deposit (and all interest thereon) pursuant to
Section 3.4, in which case such right to receive the Deposit shall be the
exclusive remedy of Buyer against Seller for breaches of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and Buyer
waives all other rights, remedies and damages to which it may be entitled in
such event (subject to Section 12.2(a) with respect to Buyers rights to
pursue Claims for fraud or willful breach or misconduct); or (y) to seek
specific performance of this Agreement, in which case Buyer shall not be
entitled to receive the Deposit

 



-32-  unless and until Buyers suit for specific performance fails, with no
further opportunity for appeal, or Buyer should subsequently elect forego its
remedy of specific performance and elect the right to receive the Deposit
(and all interest thereon) as provided in clause (x), at which time Buyer
shall have the right to receive the Deposit (and all interest thereon).

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances described in
Section 3.4(b), then (subject to Section 12.2(a) with respect to Sellers
rights to pursue Claims for fraud or willful breach or misconduct) Seller
shall be entitled to pursue (at any time prior to termination of this
Agreement): (x) the right to receive the Deposit (and all interest
thereon) pursuant to Section 3.4, in which case such right to receive the
Deposit shall be the exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer for breaches of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and Seller waives all other rights, remedies and damages to which
it may be entitled in such event (subject to Section 12.2(a) with respect to
Sellers rights to pursue Claims for fraud or willful breach or misconduct);
or (y) to seek specific performance of this Agreement, in which case Seller
shall not be entitled to receive the Deposit, unless and until Sellers suit
for specific performance fails, with no further opportunity for appeal, or
Seller should subsequently elect to forego its remedy of specific performance
and elect the right to receive the Deposit (and all interest thereon) as
provided in clause (x), at which time Seller shall have the right to receive
the Deposit (and all interest thereon).

 

 _12.3 Cooperation and Preservation of Books and Records._

 

Each Party shall provide such assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return required to be
filed in respect of the WTP Partnership Interest or Membership Interests, any
audit or other examination by a taxing authority, any judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Liability for federal, foreign, state or
local Taxes, or any claim for refund in respect of such Taxes. The Parties
shall retain, and upon request provide, any records or information which may
be reasonably relevant to such return, audit, examination, proceeding, or
claim. Such assistance shall include, but is not limited to, (a) making
employees or counsel available at and for reasonable times to provide
additional information and explanation of any material to be provided
hereunder and (b) subject to the right of each Party to refrain from
disclosing or making available any proprietary information, any written or
oral communications that are subject to the attorney client privilege and any
documents that are covered by the work product doctrine, furnishing access to,
and permitting the copying of any records, returns, schedules, documents,
work papers or other relevant materials which might reasonably be expected to
be of use in connection with such return, audit, examination, proceeding, or
claim.

 

Because the Parties and their respective Affiliates may need access, from time
to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and
information held by another Party, the Parties shall (x) use commercially
reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain such records until the 30th
day following the last date on which the period to which such records relate
is subject to audit, and (y) subject to the right of each Party to refrain
from disclosing or making available any proprietary information, any written
or oral communications that are subject to the attorney client privilege and
any documents that are covered by the work product doctrine, allow the
requesting Party and its respective agents and other representatives, at times
and dates mutually acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review, and make
copies of such records as the requesting Party may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at the requesting Partys expense.

 



-33- _12.4 Limitation of Liability._

 

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO FOR ANY
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (IN TORT,
CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) OF SUCH PARTY UNDER OR IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
FOR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE RELATED HERETO HOWSOEVER CAUSED, WHETHER OR NOT
ARISING FROM SUCH PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, UNLESS
AWARDED PURSUANT TO THE THIRD PARTY CLAIM FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE
ENTITLED TO INDEMNITY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

 

 _12.5 Taxes._

(a) Subject to Section 12.5(c), Seller shall be responsible for, and shall
bear and pay, all Taxes assessed with respect to the ownership of the
Membership Interests for (i) any period ending prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) any Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax (A) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts or wages, be deemed to
equal the amount that would be payable if the period ended (and the books of
the Acquired Companies and WTP Partnership were closed) on the Closing Date
and (B) in the case of any Taxes other than those described in clause (A)
(e.g., property or ad valorem Taxes) and Transfer Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period. All Taxes other than Transfer Taxes with respect to the
ownership of the Membership Interests arising on or after the Closing Date
(including all Straddle Period taxes not apportioned to Seller) shall be
allocated to and borne by Buyer. Upon determination of the actual amount of
Taxes, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer any additional amount necessary to
equal the Taxes with respect to the Membership Interests apportioned to Seller
pursuant to this Section 12.5(a) and any Transfer Taxes apportioned to
Seller pursuant to Section 12.5(c).

(b) Seller shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to Taxes applicable
to the Acquired Companies or with respect to Sellers interest in the
Acquired Companies due on or before the Closing Date or that otherwise relate
solely to periods before the Closing Date and shall pay any such Taxes shown
due and owing on such Tax Return, subject to Sellers right of reimbursement
for any such Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under Section 12.5(c).

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for 50% and Seller shall be responsible for
50% of any and all excise, sales, use, stamp, transfer, documentary, filing,
recordation, value added Taxes and other similar Taxes and fees, if any,
incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect
thereto and interest thereon (collectively, _"Transfer Taxes"_ ). Buyer and
Seller agree 

 



-34-  to cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes and in the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes. Seller shall be
responsible for all federal income taxes, state income taxes, and other
similar taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred or
imposed on Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

(d) For federal income tax purposes, the Parties will treat Buyers
acquisition of the Acquired Companies as an acquisition of the WTP
Partnership Interest.

SELLER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, (I) SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR

COMPANIES AND THE WTP PARTNERSHIP "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" WITH ALL FAULTS FOR
PURPOSES OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION AND THAT BUYER HAS MADE OR CAUSED TO
BE MADE SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTIONS AS BUYER DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

 

(d) SELLER AND BUYER AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE DISCLAIMERS OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN
THIS SECTION 12.6 ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS.

(e) THE INDEMNIFICATION AND RELEASE PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES IN QUESTION AROSE OR

COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW
OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS

access to the records of the Acquired Companies at reasonable times for the
purpose of defending against or prosecuting Claims asserted by or against
Seller or its Affiliates.

representations and warranties with respect to any matter first arising,

 



-36-  discovered or brought to the attention of Seller after the date hereof
which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules. For purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Article 11 have been
fulfilled, the Schedules to Sellers representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained
therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude all
information contained in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto;
provided, however, that if the Closing occurs, then all matters disclosed
pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment at or prior to the
Closing shall be waived and Buyer will not be entitled to make a claim with
respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

 

ARTICLE 13

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Agreement or any of the other documents to be delivered hereunder or the
performance, breach, validity, interpretation or enforcement thereof, it is in

resolved in the shortest time and with the lowest cost of resolution
practicable.

(a) The Party believing a dispute to exist will give the other Party prompt
written notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts alleged

-37- _13.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

sitting in Houston, Texas (in each case, including any applicable courts of
appeal thereto), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each party also
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought.
EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

_13.3 Entire Agreement._

irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any
conveyancing documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith,
the terms of this Agreement shall control.

_13.4 Waiver._

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

_13.5 Assignment. _

This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests

nothing in this Agreement is intended to create any third party beneficiary
rights respecting any Person or to confer upon any Person, other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,
remedies or obligations under or by reason of this Agreement, and the Parties
specifically negate any such intention.

enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement.

hereto are hereby made a part of this Agreement and incorporated herein by
this reference.

 



-40- _13.14 Publicity._

 

Prior to making any public announcement with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Party shall provide a copy of the contents of such
announcement to the other Party; provided, however, that any Party may make
such disclosures or statements as it reasonably believes may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements, including any rules or regulations of any stock
exchange. 

_13.15 Construction._

 

(a) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. If the date specified in this Agreement for
giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period
during which any notices required to be given or any action taken expires on a
date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or
taking such action (and the expiration date for such period during which
notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is
a Business Day.

 

(b) Whenever the context requires, reference herein made to a single number
shall be understood to include the plural; and likewise, the plural shall be
understood to include the singular. Words denoting sex shall be construed to
include the masculine, feminine, and neuter, when such construction is
appropriate; and specific enumeration shall not exclude the general but shall
be construed as cumulative. Definitions of terms defined in the singular or
plural shall be equally applicable to the plural or singular, as applicable,
unless otherwise indicated. The term "including" means "including without
limitation." All references herein to "$" or "dollars" shall refer to the
lawful currency of the United States.

(c) This Agreement, for convenience only, has been divided into articles and
sections. The rights and other legal relations of the Parties shall be
determined from this Agreement as an entirety and without regard to the
aforesaid division into articles and sections and without regard to headings
prefixed to such articles. References in this Agreement to articles, sections,
exhibits, or schedules are to such articles, sections, exhibits, or schedules
of this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

 

(d) Any item disclosed in one Section or Schedule will be deemed to be
disclosed in any other Section or Schedule where such disclosure is relevant,
even if there is no express cross reference, provided that the nature and the
relevance of the disclosure is reasonably apparent from the face and scope of
such disclosure. Disclosure of items that may or may not be required to
be disclosed by this Agreement does not mean that such items are material or
create a standard of materiality and will not be deemed an admission that any
such disclosed matter is or may give rise to a breach of any Contract or
violation of any Legal Requirement.
