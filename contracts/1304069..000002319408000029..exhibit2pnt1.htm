or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock

appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock Consideration,
and only with respect to changes in the outstanding shares of Company Common

2.3 Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "Committee") shall take all
actions necessary under the Company's Amended and Restated Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") to cause each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Option") to be cancelled
at the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. Each Company
Option shall be converted into the right to receive, from the Surviving
Entity, within two Business Days following the Effective Time, an amount (the
"Option Amount") (less any applicable withholding Taxes and without
interest) equal to the excess of (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by the Merger Consideration;
provided however that for purposes of this Section 2.3(a) only, the Per Share
Stock Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration shall be determined
using the average closing sales price of Parent Common Stock as reported by
The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding
the two Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time shall
occur (such value, the "Section 2.3 Parent Common Stock Value", over (B) the
per share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. The Option
Amount Cash Percentage of the Option Amount shall be paid in cash. The Option
Amount Stock Percentage of the Option Amount shall be paid in the form of
Parent Common Stock utilizing the Section 2.3 Parent Common Stock Value. The
"Option Amount Cash Percentage"shall be the quotient (expressed as a
percentage) of the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by the sum of the Per
Share Cash Consideration and the Section 2.3 Parent Common Stock Value.
The "Option Amount Stock Percentage" shall equal 100% less the Option Amount
Cash Percentage. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, with respect to
Company Options, the right to receive payment of the Option Amount. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Committee shall
take all actions necessary under the Stock Plan, the award agreements
thereunder and otherwise to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3(a),
including providing notice to the holders of Company Options of
such provisions

(b) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, as of the Effective
Time, the restrictions on each restricted share of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Restricted Stock") granted and then outstanding under the Stock
Plan shall, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, lapse, and each such share of Company
Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time,
and each such share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated at the
Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the
same conditions, as each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any
restrictions; provided, that upon vesting the holder may satisfy the
applicable withholding Tax obligations by returning to the Surviving Entity
or Parent a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in
value to such obligation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Committee shall take all actions necessary under the
Stock Plan, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this
Section 2.3(a).

 

 

(c) Except as contemplated by clauses (a) and (b) above, the Surviving Entity
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holders of Company Options or Company
Restricted Stock such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company Options or Company
Restricted Stock, as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be. The Surviving Entity and Parent agree that no wage
withholding shall be made with respect to Restricted Stock with respect to
which a valid and timely election has been made under Section 83(b) of the
Code unless required by applicable Law.

2.4 Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Company's transfer agent or a bank
or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent Common Stock to make
pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as
required by this Article II. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and to make payments in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.4(e). Any cash and Parent Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional
shares in accordance with Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.4(c)) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.4(c) and 2.4(e)
hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) shares of Parent Common Stock representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B)
a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 and this Article II,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(e) and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.4(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.4, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Stock. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Common
Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.4. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash due pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the
Parent Common Stock and payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such Parent Common Stock.

 

 

(d) Further Rights in Company Common Shares. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or
Section 2.4(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

 

 

(e) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common
Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five
trading days immediately preceding the two Business Days prior to the date on
which the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit such amount with the
Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after 180
days following the Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders
of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c), in
each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(g) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.

 

 

(i) Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(j) Book Entry. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

 

 

2.5 Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the
Company. From and after the close of business on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall be converted into the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.

moratorium or other Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors'
rights generally and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity

(b) The December 31, 2007 consolidated balance sheet of the Company (the
"Company Balance Sheet") and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows (including, in
each case, the related notes, where applicable), as reported in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 filed
with the SEC under the Exchange Act, fairly present (within the meaning of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the financial statements to be filed by the
Company with the SEC after the date of this Agreement will fairly present

normal in nature and amount), in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates or for the respective fiscal periods therein set forth; each
of such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies,
and the financial statements to be filed by the Company with the SEC after
the date of this Agreement will comply, with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto; and each of such statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) has been, and the financial statements to be filed by the
Company with the SEC after the date of this Agreement will be, prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as
indicated in the notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP
and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. Ernst and Young LLP is an independent public accounting
firm with respect to the Company and has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of the Company. Ernst and Young LLP has not
indicated to the Company that it has any material disagreements with the
Company's accounting policies.

 

 

(c) The Company has not received any notice from the SEC that its accounting
policies are subject to review or investigation, except for those comments

respective Stock Plan under which such Company Option was granted) of a share
of Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Company
Option, and (B) all grants of Company Options were validly issued and
properly approved by the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee or
subcommittee thereof) in material compliance with applicable Law and recorded
in the Company's financial statements referred to in Section 3.5(b) in
accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward
dating" or similar practices with respect to the effective date of grant.

 

 

3.6 Oil and Gas.

 

 

(a) The Company has furnished to Parent a reserve report prepared by Lee
Keeling and Associates, Inc. containing estimates of the oil and gas reserves
that are owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007
(the "Company Reserve Report"). The factual, non-interpretive data relating
to the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the
Company Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and gas
reserves set forth therein, to the knowledge of the Company, was accurate in
all material respects at the time such data was provided to the reserve
engineers for the Company Reserve Report. The Company Reserve Report conforms
to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the
oil and gas industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Since January 1, 2005, all of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
wells have been drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced
in compliance in all respects with applicable oil and gas leases and
applicable Laws, except where any noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Company's
knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of
any applicable Law or contract requiring the Company or such Subsidiary to
plug and abandon any well because the well is not currently capable of
producing in commercial quantities or for any other reasons. With respect to
any Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not
operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company makes the
representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.6 only to its
actual knowledge without having made specific inquiry of the operators with
respect hereto.

indirect interests in and rights with respect to oil, gas or minerals,
including working, leasehold and mineral interests and operating rights and
royalties, overriding royalties, production payments, net profit interests
and other non-working interests and non-operating interests; all interests in
rights with respect to oil, condensate, gas, casinghead gas and other liquid
or gaseous hydrocarbons (collectively, "Hydrocarbons") and other minerals or
revenues therefrom, all contracts in connection therewith and claims and
rights thereto (including all oil and gas leases, operating agreements,
unitization and pooling agreements and orders, division orders, transfer
orders, mineral deeds, royalty deeds, oil and gas sales, exchange
and processing contracts and agreements, and in each case, interests
thereunder), surface interests, fee interests, reversionary interests,
reservations, and concessions; all easements, rights of way, licenses,
permits, leases, and other interests associated with, appurtenant to, or
necessary for the operation of any of the foregoing; and all interests in
equipment and machinery (including wells, well equipment and machinery), oil
and gas production, gathering, transmission, treating, processing, and
storage facilities (including tanks, tank batteries, pipelines, and gathering
systems), pumps, water plants, electric plants, gasoline and gas processing
plants, refineries, and other tangible personal property and fixtures
associated with, appurtenant to, or necessary for the operation of any of the
foregoing.

the ordinary course of business or which would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect).

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

Company or any of its Subsidiaries received any material payment for
production which is subject to refund or recoupment out of future production.

 

 

(f) The Company has previously provided or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all Company Oil and Gas Agreements, together with all

the Company, all Company Oil and Gas Agreements are in good standing, valid
and effective and all royalties, rentals and other payment due by the Company
to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid, except in each
case, as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a

Agreements that contain restrictions on the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' ability to operate, obtain, explore for or develop interests in
a particular geographic area.

subject to (i) any instrument or agreement evidencing or related to
indebtedness for borrowed money, whether directly or indirectly, except for
the Company Credit Agreement and Permitted Liens, or (ii) any agreement not
entered into in the ordinary course of business (other than the Overriding
Royalty Interest Incentive Plan) in which the amount involved is in excess of
$1 million. In addition, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents
filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof, no Company Material
Contract contains any provision that prevents the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from owning, managing and operating the Oil and Gas Interests of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with historical practices.

 

 

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.6(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

Company Reserve Report; and none of the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are limited by terms fixed by a certain number of years
(other than primary terms under oil and gas leases).

there are no calls (exclusive of market calls) on the Company's oil or
natural gas production, and the Company has no obligation to deliver oil or
natural gas pursuant to any take-or-pay, prepayment or similar arrangement
without receiving full payment therefor, excluding gas imbalances disclosed
in Section 3.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Parent Disclosure Letter") (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent
specified therein and such other representations, warranties or covenants to
the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make its
relevance to such other representation, warranty or covenant reasonably
apparent), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

 

 

4.1 Organization.

 

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent's Subsidiaries is a corporation or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the

organization, and has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to
own, lease, use and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted.

 

 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Parent's Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (to the
extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the character of the
property owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Since the date of its formation, Merger Sub has not engaged in
any activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by
this Agreement, and Merger Sub does not have any Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) Parent has previously made available to the Company a complete, true and
correct copy of each of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other
organizational documents of each of Parent's Subsidiaries, in each case as
amended (if so amended) to the date of this Agreement, and has made available
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
each of Parent's Subsidiaries, in each case as amended (if so amended) to the
date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of the
Parent's Subsidiaries is in violation of its certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents.

 

 

(d) Section 4.1(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete,
true and correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of Parent and their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization. The respective
certificates or articles of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of Parent do not contain any provision limiting
or otherwise restricting the ability of Parent to control its Subsidiaries in
any material respect.

there are no outstanding or authorized (x) options, warrants, preemptive
rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights, convertible
securities, agreements, claims or commitments of any character obligating
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity interest in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, (y) contractual obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of Parent or any

or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the

this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and
non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Such Parent Common Stock, where
so issued, will be issued free and clear of any Liens, other than (x)

as may expect under applicable Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) (i) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or
equivalent equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of
Parent's Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent free and
clear of any Liens, other than (x) statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, (y) such restrictions as may exist under applicable Law, and (z)
Liens granted pursuant to Parent's Credit Agreement, dated as of November 1,

assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof, and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock or other securities of, or
interest in, any other Person, except for the securities of the Subsidiaries

requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject, with respect to the consummation of the Merger,
to the receipt of the Parent Required Vote. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action,
except for the Parent Required Vote. Except for the Parent Required Vote, no
corporate or other proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by either of Parent or Merger Sub and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws, now or hereafter in
effect, affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, or the certificate of incorporation,

pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, guarantee, other evidence of indebtedness, lease,
license, contract, collective bargaining agreement, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub, or any of
Parent's other Subsidiaries, is a party or by which any of them or any of
their respective assets or properties may be bound, or (iii) assuming the
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, filings or
permits referred to in Section 4.4(b) are duly and timely obtained or made
and the Parent Required Vote and the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by Parent as the sole member of Merger Sub,

flows (including, in each case, the related notes, where applicable), as
reported in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of this Agreement will
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders' equity of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates or for the respective fiscal periods therein set forth; each of such
statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies, and the
financial statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of
this Agreement will comply, with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each
of such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been,
and the financial statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the
date of this Agreement will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes

are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Ernst and

validly issued and properly approved by the Parent Board (or a duly
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in material compliance with
applicable Law and recorded in Parent's financial statements referred to in

4.6 Oil and Gas Reserves.

 

 

(a) Parent has furnished to the Company a reserve report prepared by
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. containing estimates of the oil and gas
reserves that are owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 (the "Parent Reserve Report"). The factual, non-interpretive data
relating to the Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries on which
the Parent Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and
gas reserves set forth therein, to the knowledge of Parent, was accurate in
all material respects at the time such data was provided to the reserve
engineers for the Parent Reserve Report. The Parent Reserve Report conforms
to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the
oil and gas industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Since January 1, 2005, all of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' wells have been
drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced in compliance in
all respects with applicable oil and gas leases and applicable Laws, except
where any noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. To Parent's knowledge, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in violation of any applicable Law or contract requiring
Parent or such Subsidiary to plug and abandon any well because the well is
not currently capable of producing in commercial quantities or for any
other reasons. With respect to any Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and
its Subsidiaries that are not operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent makes the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.6
only to its actual knowledge without having made specific inquiry of the
operators with respect hereto.

 

 

(b) Set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter is a list of
all material Oil and Gas Interests that were included in the Parent Reserve
Report that have been disposed of prior to the date hereof.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from Parent's Oil and Gas
Interests are being received by Parent and its Subsidiaries in a timely
manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason (except in the
ordinary course of business or which would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect).

 

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
none of Parent or its Subsidiaries has received any material deficiency
payment under any gas contract for which any Person has a right to take
deficiency gas from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries received any material payment for production which is
subject to refund or recoupment out of future production.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Parent has previously provided or made available to the Company true and
complete copies of all Parent Oil and Gas Agreements, together with all
amendments, extensions and other modifications thereof. To the knowledge
of Parent, all Parent Oil and Gas Agreements are in good standing, valid
and effective and all royalties, rentals and other payment due by Parent to
any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid, except in each
case, as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Oil and
Gas Agreements" means the following types of agreements or contracts to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, whether as an original party,
by succession or assignment or otherwise: oil and gas leases, farm-in
and farm-out agreements, agreements providing for an overriding royalty
interest, agreements providing for a royalty interest, agreements providing
for a net profits interest, crude oil or natural gas sales or purchase
contracts, joint operating agreements, unit operating agreements, unit
agreements, field equipment leases, and agreements restricting Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries' ability to operate, obtain, explore for or develop
interests in a particular geographic area. Set forth in Section 4.6(e) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter is a list of all Parent Oil and Gas Agreements that
contain restrictions on Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' ability to
operate, obtain, explore for or develop interests in a particular geographic
area.

 

 

(f) The Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not subject
to (i) any instrument or agreement evidencing or related to indebtedness for
borrowed money, whether directly or indirectly, except for the Parent Credit
Agreement and Permitted Liens, or (ii) any agreement not entered into in the
ordinary course of business in which the amount involved is in excess of
$1 million. In addition, except as set forth in the Parent SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof, no Parent
Material Contract contains any provision that prevents Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries from owning, managing and operating the Oil and Gas Interests of
Parent and its Subsidiaries in accordance with historical practices.

 

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as
of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding calls for
payments in excess of $1 million that are due or that Parent or its
Subsidiaries are committed to make that have not been made; (ii) there are no
material operations with respect to which Parent or its Subsidiaries have
become a non-consenting party; and (iii) there are no commitments for the
material expenditure of funds for drilling or other capital projects other
than projects with respect to which the operator is not required under the
applicable operating agreement to seek consent.

 

 

(h) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
there are no provisions applicable to the material Oil and Gas Interests
reflected in the Parent Reserve Report that increase the royalty percentage
of the lessor thereunder in a manner that is not accounted for in such Parent
Reserve Report; and none of the Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are limited by terms fixed by a certain number of years (other
than primary terms under oil and gas leases).

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
there are no calls (exclusive of market calls) on Parent's oil or natural gas
production, and Parent has no obligation to deliver oil or natural gas
pursuant to any take-or-pay, prepayment or similar arrangement without
receiving full payment therefor, excluding gas imbalances disclosed in
Section 4.6(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

4.7 Absence of Certain Changes.

 

 

(a) Since December 31, 2007, (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective business only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice in all material respects, and (ii) there has not occurred or
continued to exist any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, circumstance
or condition which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.7(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
since December 31, 2007 to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has (i) declared, set aside or paid any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any of
Parent's capital stock, (ii) effected or authorized any split, combination or
reclassification of any of Parent's capital stock or any issuance thereof or
issued any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for
shares of Parent's capital stock, except for issuances of Parent Common Stock

with their terms at the time of exercise or (2) in connection with
recruitment activities in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (iii) changed in any material respect, or has knowledge of any
reason that would have required or would require changing in any material
respect, any accounting methods (or underlying assumptions), principles or
practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries, including any material reserving,
renewal or residual method, practice or policy, except as required by GAAP or
by applicable Law, (iv) made any material Tax election or settled or
compromised any material income Tax liability, (v) made any material change
in the policies and procedures of Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection
with trading activities, (vi) sold, leased exchanged, transferred
or otherwise disposed of any material Parent Asset other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, (vii) revalued,
or has knowledge of any reason that would have required or would require
revaluing, any of the Parent Assets in any material respect, including
writing down the value of any of Parent Assets or writing off notes or
accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices, (viii) except as required to comply with applicable Law,
adopted or amended any new or existing Parent Benefit Plan, or (ix) made any
agreement or commitment (contingent or otherwise) to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

4.8 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Since December 31, 2007 and except
as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent
or Merger Sub, nor any of Parent's other Subsidiaries, has incurred any
liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or otherwise), except for (i)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
(ii) liabilities in respect of Litigation (which are the subject of Section
4.11(a)), and (iii) liabilities under Environmental Laws (which are the
subject of Section 4.15). None of Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of Parent's
other Subsidiaries, is in default in respect of the terms and conditions of
any indebtedness or other agreement which individually or in the aggregate
has had, or would be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

4.9 Disclosure Documents. None of the information to be supplied by Parent

compensation plans or arrangements of any type (including, without
limitation, all bonus, equity-based, change of control, incentive and plans
described in Section 3(3) of ERISA), sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Parent or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which
together with Parent would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning
of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (a
"Parent ERISA Affiliate") or with respect to which any Parent ERISA Affiliate
has any obligations or liability ("Parent Benefit Plans"), and Section
4.10(a)(2) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists each material individual
employment, severance or similar agreement with respect to which Parent or
any Parent ERISA Affiliate has any current or future obligation or liability
("Parent Employee Agreement"). With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan,

such Parent Benefit Plan, and, to the extent applicable, trust agreements,
insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, the most recent Annual
Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, summary plan

satisfies the requirements of such sections and has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its
qualification, and its related trust has been determined to be exempt from
tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the knowledge of Parent, nothing
has occurred since the date of such letter to adversely affect such
qualification or exemption; (ii) each Parent Benefit Plan has been
administered in substantial compliance with its terms and applicable Law;
(iii) neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and
Parent and each Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any
Person that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or failed to act in any
manner that would subject Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to any
liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA; (iv) no disputes
are pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate,
threatened other than ordinary claims for benefits; (v) neither Parent nor
any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and Parent and each Parent ERISA
Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any
transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code for which no exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section
4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of the Code; (vi) all contributions
and premiums due have been made on a timely basis; and (vii) each Parent
Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated unilaterally by Parent at any time
without any continuing liability for benefits other than benefits accrued to
the date of such amendment or termination. All contributions and premiums
made or required to be made under any Parent Benefit Plan meet the
requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all contributions which
are required and which have not been made have been properly recorded on the

meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), (iii) subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (iv) a multiple employer welfare
arrangement under Section 3(40) of ERISA. No event has occurred with respect

payments in the ordinary course of plan business), lien or encumbrance with
respect to any Parent Benefit Plan.

 

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
(i) no present or former employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are
covered by any Parent Employee Agreements or Parent Benefit Plans that
provide or will provide any severance pay, post-termination health or life
insurance benefits (except as required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code
or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA) or any similar benefits, (ii) neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause any payments or benefits to any
employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be
either subject to an excise Tax or non-deductible to Parent under Sections
4999 and 280G of the Code, respectively, whether or not some other subsequent
action or event would be required to cause such payment or benefit to be
triggered, and (iii) neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall result
in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of

action or event would be required to cause such payment or benefit to be
triggered, accelerated, delivered or increased.

capacities as such), (ii) there is no order, judgment, decree, injunction or
award of any Governmental Entity against and/or binding upon Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of Parent's officers or directors (in their
capacities as such) and (iii) there is no Litigation that Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries, has pending against
other parties, where such Litigation is intended to enforce or preserve

aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries
has complied, and is in compliance with, all Laws and Parent Permits which
affect the respective businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Parent Real Property and/or Parent Assets, and Parent and its Subsidiaries
have not been and are not in violation of any such Law or Parent Permit; nor
has any notice, charge, Claim or action been received in writing by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any
violation of the foregoing, except for such violations or allegations of
violations as individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of clause (b) above and mindful of the
principles of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
similar applicable foreign Laws, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, in any such case, any of their respective Representatives has (i) made,
offered or authorized any payment or given or offered anything of value
directly or indirectly (including through a friend or family member with
personal relationships with government officials) to an official of any
government for the purpose of influencing an act or decision in his official
capacity or inducing him to use his influence with that government with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar applicable
foreign Laws, (ii) made, offered or authorized any payment to any
Governmental Entity, political party or political candidate for the purpose

Entities or other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing, operation,
occupancy and use of the Parent Real Property, Parent Assets and the conduct
of their respective businesses as currently conducted ("Parent Permits"),
except where the failure to hold such Parent Permits individually or in the
aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice that any Parent Permit will be terminated or
modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and Parent
has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination,
modification or nonrenewal, in each case except for such terminations,
modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any Parent Permit, or result
in any termination, modification or nonrenewal thereof, except in each case
for such violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals
that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any violation of
the foregoing restrictions by any of the Company's Subsidiaries or by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative
is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board may take any actions described in clause
(ii) of this Section 5.3(a) with respect to a Person at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Required Vote if, prior to such vote, (w) the Company
receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
from such Person (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives after the date of this Agreement),
(x) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal from the Person that
made the applicable Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, (y) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company and the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that the Person making such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to
have the ability to consummate such Acquisition Proposal, provided that the
Company shall not deliver any information to such Person without entering
into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; no actions taken in accordance
with this sentence shall constitute a violation of clause (i) of this
Section 5.3(a). Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case
to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after the Company's
receipt thereof), the Company shall advise Parent in writing of any request
for information from a Person that has made, or the Company reasonably
believes may be contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company received from
any Person, or any inquiry made or discussions or negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company, and the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by
the Company in connection with any of the foregoing and any correspondence
related thereto, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company which was not previously provided to
Parent as promptly as practicable after it provides such information to such
other Person. The Company shall keep Parent fully and promptly informed
of the status of any Acquisition Proposals with respect to the Company
(including the identity of the parties and price involved and any material
changes to any terms and conditions thereof). The Company agrees not to
release any third party from or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality
agreement related to any potential Acquisition Proposal or any standstill
agreement, in each case in favor of the Company.

 

 

(c) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii) shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries execute or enter into, any agreement, including any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(a))
(each an "Acquisition Agreement") with respect to the Company or (B)
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, and subject to the Company's compliance at all times with the
provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (as a result of such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change) cancel the Company Special Meeting: (x) if,
not in connection with an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company and the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; or (y) if in connection with an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company and the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that the
Company Board may not make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change until
five Business Days after Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company
(a "Company Notice of Change") advising Parent that the Company Board
has determined:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) in the case of clause (x) of this Section 5.3(c), that the Company Board
intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and containing the
material facts and information constituting the basis for such determination
by the Company Board that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company and the stockholders of the Company (it being understood and agreed
that any material change to such facts and information shall require a new
Company Notice of Change and a new five Business Day period). During such
five Business Day period, the Company shall, at the request of Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes or
modifications to this Agreement that would allow the Company Board not to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary
duties; provided that a determination by the Company Board in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that, after taking into account any such changes or modifications, the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company and the stockholders of the Company
shall not require a new Company Notice of Change or a new five Business Day
notice period; and

 

 

(2) in the case of clause (y) of this Section 5.3(c), that such Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company constitutes a Superior Proposal, that
the Company Board intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and containing all information required by Sections 5.3(a) and 5.3(b),
together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of such
Superior Proposal unless previously provided and a summary of the terms and
conditions of such proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Change and a new five Business
Day notice period). During such five Business Day period, the Company shall,
at the request of Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to
any revised offer from Parent in respect of the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In making a determination that such
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company and the
stockholders of the Company, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes or modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
(in response to a Company Notice of Change or otherwise); provided that
a determination by the Company Board in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, after taking into
account any such changes or modifications, such Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company and the stockholders of
the Company shall not require a new Company Notice of Change or a new five
Business Day notice period.

(d) Parent agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective Representatives not to, (i)
directly or indirectly initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Parent, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
disclose any non-public information relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent or to any Person that Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives knows or has reason
to believe is contemplating making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Parent, or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or
enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent or agreement in
principle (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
circumstances contemplated in the penultimate sentence of this Section
5.3(d)), (x) providing for, constituting or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent or (y) that would require, or would have the
effect of causing, Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of Parent's Subsidiaries or by
any Representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Parent
Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(d)
with respect to a Person at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Required
Vote if, prior to such approval, (w) Parent receives a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent from such Person (and
such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged
or facilitated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives after the date of this Agreement), (x) the Parent
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal from the Person that made
the applicable Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, (y) the Parent
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Parent and the stockholders of Parent under applicable
Law, and (z) the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably expected to have the ability to
consummate such Acquisition Proposal, provided that Parent shall not deliver
any information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; no actions taken in accordance with this sentence
shall constitute a violation of clause (i) of this Section 5.3(d). Nothing
contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from
taking and disclosing to Parent's stockholders a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law.

(e) Parent agrees that in addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in
paragraph (d) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after Parent's receipt thereof),
Parent shall advise the Company in writing of any request for information
from a Person that has made, or Parent reasonably believes may be
contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent received from any Person, or any
inquiry made or discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent,
and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and Parent shall promptly provide to
the Company copies of any written materials received by Parent in connection
with any of the foregoing and any correspondence related thereto, and the
identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place.
Parent agrees that it shall provide to the Company any non-public information
concerning Parent or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person or group
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent which was
not previously provided to the Company as promptly as practicable after it
provides such information to such other Person. Parent shall keep the Company
fully and promptly informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals with
respect to Parent (including the identity of the parties and price involved
and any material changes to any terms and conditions thereof). Parent agrees
not to release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality agreement related to any potential Acquisition Proposal or
any standstill agreement, in each case in favor of Parent.

 

 

(f) Neither (i) the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the
Company), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Parent Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to

an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(d))
with respect to Parent or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Parent Required Vote, and subject to Parent's
compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section
5.6, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and (as
a result of such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) cancel the
Parent Special Meeting: (x) if, not in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, the Parent Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent and the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law; or (y) if in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent that the Parent Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Parent and the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law; provided,
however, that the Parent Board may not make any Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change until five Business Days after the Company's receipt of written notice

period, Parent shall, at the request of the Company, negotiate in good faith

of Change or a new five Business Day notice period; and

 

 

(2) in the case of clause (y) of this Section 5.3(f), that such Acquisition

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with
respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, any proposal, whether
or not in writing (other than by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Company, or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with
respect to Parent), for the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
a business or assets that generates or constitutes 25% or more of the net
revenues, net income or the assets (based on the book or fair market value
thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including
capital stock of or ownership interest in any Subsidiary), (ii) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more of any class of
equity securities or capital stock of such party or any of its Subsidiaries
whose business generates or constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets (based on the book or fair market value thereof) of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation,
restructuring, transfer of assets or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization,
stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that if consummated
would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 25% or more of any
class of equity securities of such party or any of its Subsidiaries whose
business generates or constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets (based on the book or fair market value thereof) of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean, with respect to
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to such party that was not initiated, solicited,
knowingly facilitated or encouraged by such party or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives in violation of this Agreement,
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, share, exchange, asset purchase or
other business combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) 50% or more of the equity
securities of such party, in each case on terms which the majority of
the Board of Directors of such party determines (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) in good faith (A) would
result in a transaction that, if consummated, is more favorable to the
stockholders of such party (in their capacity as stockholders), than the
Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered
by the other party in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise
pursuant to this Section 5.3), and (B) is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, any factually accurate and complete public
statement by a party hereto that does nothing more than disclose the receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party that was not initiated,
solicited or knowingly facilitated or encouraged after the date of this
Agreement by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, and the terms thereof, shall not be deemed to be a
recommendation of such Acquisition Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(i) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company
and Parent, respectively. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall
(i) take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives involved
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 5.3 and (ii) request each Person who has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the last 12 months in
connection with such Person's consideration of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to it, or any similar transaction to return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such
Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on its behalf.

 

 

5.4 Access to Information and Properties.

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives
of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel
(including lenders' counsel), financial advisors, lenders and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, offices, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books
and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other parties all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other parties may
reasonably request. No party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent and the Company will hold any information obtained or contemplated
under Section 5.4(a) above in accordance with the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as September
12, 2007, and the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent,
dated as of April 16, 2008 (collectively, the "Confidentiality Agreements").

 

 

(c) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
Representatives made pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth
in this Agreement.

 

 

5.5 Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, to
obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect
all necessary registrations and filings. Each of the parties hereto will
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and, subject to applicable Laws and any applicable privilege
relating to the exchange of information, will provide the other parties with
copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity (except
for filings available publicly on the SEC's EDGAR system) or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that
neither party is obligated to share any document submitted to a Governmental
Entity that reflects the negotiations between the parties or the valuation of
some or all of any party's business.

 

 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with the other parties to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the laws, rules, guidelines or
regulations of any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file Notification and
Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation.

 

 

(c) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Entity shall take or cause
to be taken all such necessary action.

 

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept, as a condition to
obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any
Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust
(or the imposition of any other condition or restriction with respect to) any
assets or operations of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates or any of the respective businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Company Assets.

 

 

(f) The Company shall provide to Parent as soon as available but in any event
on or before September 30, 2008 an interim reserve report prepared by the
Company containing estimates of the oil and gas reserves that are owned by
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2008 (the "Interim
Company Reserve Report"). The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the
Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the
Interim Company Reserve Report shall be based for purposes of estimating the
oil and gas reserves set forth therein shall be, to the knowledge of the
Company, accurate in all material respects at the time such data is utilized
by the Company for the Interim Reserve Report.

 

 

5.6 Proxy Statement; S-4; Company Special Meeting; Parent Special Meeting.

 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and each shall

5.8 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, advancement
of expenses and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and former officers and
directors of the Company as provided in the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or in the agreements listed in Section 5.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, in each case in effect as of the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms and without amendment thereof.

 

 

(b) Parent shall maintain the directors' and officers' ("DandO") insurance
that serves to reimburse persons currently covered by the Company's DandO
insurance in full force and effect for the continued benefit of such persons
for a continuous period of not less than three years from the Effective Time
on terms that are not materially different from the Company's DandO insurance
currently in effect (provided that the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions that are not less favorable) with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that the annual premium for
such insurance shall not exceed 150% of the per annum rate of premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance on the date of
this Agreement. In the event that the annual premium for such
insurance exceeds such maximum amount, Parent shall purchase as much coverage
per policy year as reasonably obtainable for such maximum amount.

 

 

(c) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to law, contract or otherwise.

 

 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Entity or Parent, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 

 

5.9 Publicity. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of their
respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
consultation of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with, or regulation of, any securities exchange or
regulatory authority if all reasonable best efforts have been made to consult
with the other party. In addition, the Company shall to the extent reasonably
practicable consult with Parent regarding the form and content of any public
disclosure of any material developments or matters involving the Company,
including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or release.

5.11 Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
participation or vesting (but not the accrual of benefits under any defined
benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent in which Company Employees may
participate, such Company Employees shall be credited for service accrued as
of the Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent
such service was credited under a similar plan, program or arrangement of the
Company.

 

 

(b) To the extent Company Employees and their dependents enroll in any health
plan sponsored by Parent, Parent shall waive any preexisting condition
limitation applicable to such Company Employees to the extent that the
employee's or dependent's condition would not have operated as a preexisting
condition under the group health plan maintained by the Company. In addition,
Parent shall cause such health plans (i) to waive all waiting periods
otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their dependents, other than
waiting periods that are in effect with respect to such individuals as of the
Effective Time to the extent not satisfied under the corresponding benefit
plans of the Company, and (ii) to provide each Company Employee and his or
her dependents with corresponding credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid by them under the corresponding benefit plans of Company during the
portion of the respective plan year prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) With respect to any Company Employees who become employed by Parent after
the Effective Time, Parent will permit such Company Employees to schedule and
take vacation days that have accrued prior to the Effective Time with pay
through December 31, 2008, and Parent shall give service credit for purposes
of determining post Effective Time vacation, sick leave and any other paid
time off entitlements that Parent provides to its employees generally.

 

 

(d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall terminate, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, such Company Benefit Plan(s) that are identified by
Parent, other than the Retention Bonus Plan and the Overriding Royalty
Interest Incentive Plan.

 

 

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects relating to any actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.11.
The Company shall allow Parent reasonable opportunities to meet with
employees of the Company from the date hereof to the Effective Time in order
to discuss and answer questions regarding employment and benefits.

 

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any benefit plan, program or agreement sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. No
Company Employee nor any other Person (other than the parties to this
Agreement) is intended to be a beneficiary of the provisions of this Section
5.11. Nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed or interpreted
as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of
any Company Employee after the Effective Time.

For purposes of this Section 5.11, a "Company Employee" shall mean an
individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the
Effective Time and who thereafter remains or becomes an employee of Parent or
a Subsidiary of Parent (including the Surviving Entity).

 

 

5.12 Certain Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d).

 

 

(c) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver
to Locke Lord Bissell and Liddell LLP, tax counsel for the Company, and Vinson
and Elkins L.L.P., tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the
form agreed to by the parties and such firms at such time or times as may
reasonably be requested by such firms, including contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, at the time the S-4 is declared effective by the
SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with such tax counsel's respective
delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d) hereof. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or
fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be
untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
certificates described in this Section 5.12(c).

 

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time. Each of Merger Sub and the Company shall pay, without
deduction from any amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and
without reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on
it by any Governmental Entity, which becomes payable in connection with
the Merger.

 

 

(e) Neither Parent nor Company will take (or fail to take) (and following the
Merger, Parent will cause the Surviving Entity not to take or fail to take)
any action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. With respect to the Merger, Parent will (and
following the Merger will cause the Surviving Entity to) file all required
information with its Returns and maintain all records required for Tax
purposes consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

(f) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company agrees to (i)
prepare all Returns, other than income tax Returns, for any periods ending
prior to the Closing Date and which are required to be filed within 15 days
following such date (taking extensions to file into account) using tax
accounting methods and principles consistent with those used for preceding
tax periods, unless a change is required by applicable Law or regulation, and
(ii) prepare and submit to Parent income tax Returns, including quarterly
income tax estimates, where such Returns would be required to be filed prior
to 30 days following the Closing Date (taking extensions to file into
account). The Company shall make such income tax Returns available to the
Parent for review prior to filing with the relevant Governmental Entity and
shall not refuse any reasonable request by the Parent with respect to such
Returns. Such Returns shall be prepared and filed, and all related taxes
paid, on or prior to the Closing Date.

and their respective Boards of Directors, shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action
Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP.

representations and warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement are or
shall become untrue, which untruth would give rise to the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a); provided, however, that the right of

taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the matters
presented in connection with the Merger, but after any such approval no

compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties
hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions,
to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right
or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or

irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably and
unconditionally waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding. Each of the parties hereto
further agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document in any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without

on such party. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive
