44     3    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of December 29, 2003 (this "Agreement"), among COUNTRY Life
Insurance Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Acquiror"), COUNTRY Medical
Plans, Inc., a stock insurance company (the "Acquiror Sub") and Cotton States
Life Insurance Company, a Georgia domestic stock insurance company (the
"Company").   W I T N E S S E T H   WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to
the conditions contained in this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement
intend to effect the merger of Acquiror Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company as the surviving corporation;   WHEREAS, the respective boards
of directors of each of the Company, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have adopted
resolutions approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, in the case of the board of directors of the Company,
recommending that the shareholders of the Company approve of this Agreement
and the Merger in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code, as
amended (the "GBCC");   WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to
Acquiror\'s and Acquiror Sub\'s willingness to enter into the Agreement,
certain holders and beneficial owners of Company Common Stock are entering
into Shareholder Agreements with the Acquiror (each a "Shareholder
Agreement"); and   WHEREAS, capitalized terms not defined in the context of
the section in which they first appear shall have the meanings set forth in
Section 8.12.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained
herein, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER   1.01
The Merger. At the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the following shall occur:   (a) Acquiror Sub
shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence
of Acquiror Sub shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Georgia, and the separate corporate existence of the Company
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Merger;   (b) the Merger shall have the effects
specified in the GBCC and the IBCA;   (c) the Company Articles shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation;   (d) the by-laws
of Acquiror Sub shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation; and  
(e) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
directors and officers of Acquiror Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time; such directors shall hold office until such time as their
successors shall be duly elected (or appointed) and qualified.   4   
1.02 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective upon the time
specified in the articles of merger in accordance with Section 14-2-1105
of the GBCC and Section 5/11.40 of the IBCA. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger to become effective (a) on
a day within ten Business Days after the last of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 (other than conditions relating solely to the delivery of documents
dated the Closing Date) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement (or, at the election of the Acquiror, on the
last Business Day of the month in which such day occurs), or (b) on such date
as the parties may agree in writing (the "Closing Date").   ARTICLE 2  
CONSIDERATION   2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of any shares of the Acquiror
Sub\'s common stock:   (a) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares and
Dissenters\' Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
consideration comprising $20.25 in cash (the "Consideration"), and, at the
Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and from
and after the Effective Time, certificates representing Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(a);   (b) each
share of Acquiror Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and   (c) each Company
Stock Award issued and outstanding immediately prior the Effective Time
shall, as applicable, be converted into the right to receive the payment
specified in Section 2.05 or terminated as described in Section 2.05.   (d)
each share of Company Common Stock held as Treasury Shares or Dissenters\'
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
at the Effective Time and, except as set forth in Section 2.04 with respect
to Dissenters\' Shares, no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor.   2.02 Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. At the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of
Dissenters\' Shares, if applicable) shall cease to be, and shall have no
rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than to receive any dividend or
other distribution with respect to such Company Common Stock with a record
date occurring prior to the Effective Time and the right to receive
Consideration provided under this Article 2. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock.   2.03 Payment for Shares.
Acquiror shall make available or cause to be made available to such bank as
the Acquiror shall appoint (and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company), as paying agent (the "Paying Agent"), amounts sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of Consideration to holders of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock a form (mutually agreed to by the
Acquiror and the Company) of letter of transmittal and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the certificates which, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represented any of such shares in exchange for
payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such certificates,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly cause the Paying Agent   5   to pay to each Person entitled
thereto a check in the amount of the Consideration to which such Person is
entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any amount payable upon the surrender of any
such certificate. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of
such payment that the certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to
a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. One hundred
and eighty days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) made available
to the Paying Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the
Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
cash payable upon due surrender of their certificates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to
any holder of certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   2.04 Dissenting
Shareholders. Dissenters\' Shares shall be purchased and paid for in
accordance with Sections 14-2-1301 to 14-2-1332 of the GBCC. The Company
shall give Acquiror (a) prompt notice of any written demands for fair value
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the GBCC and received by the Company,
and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for fair value under the GBCC. The Company shall not,
except with prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenters\' Shares or offer
to settle, or settle, any such demands.   2.05 Company Stock Awards.  
(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, then
outstanding, vested and exercisable, without any action on the part of the
holder shall be converted into the right to receive payment of an amount in
cash equal to the product of (a) the excess of the Consideration Per
Share over the exercise price per share, if any, subject to such Company
Stock Option and (b) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the Company
shall be entitled to withhold from such cash payment any amounts required to
be withheld by applicable law. Each Company Stock Option to which the
foregoing applies will be cancelled and shall cease to exist by virtue of
such payment. Each unvested, or otherwise unexercisable Company Sock Option
shall be cancelled and terminated without any payment to the holder thereof
as to the unvested portion.   (b) As soon as practicable following execution
of this Agreement but in no event later than the date the shareholders of the
Company vote to adopt the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and
approve the Merger, the Company will enter into agreements with each holder
of restricted stock granted under the Company\'s Performance Share Award Plan
to provide that the shareholder approval of the plan of merger contained in
this Agreement will not constitute a "change of control" of the Company for
purposes of the Performance Share Award Plan. The agreements with each holder
of restricted stock granted under the Performance Share Award Plan shall also
provide that immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
restricted stock of the Company then outstanding, without any action on the
part of the holder shall be converted into the right to receive payment of an
amount in cash equal to the Consideration Per Share, provided that the
Company shall be entitled to withhold from such cash payment any amounts
required to be withheld by applicable law. Each share of restricted stock to
which the foregoing applies will be cancelled and shall cease to exist by
virtue of such payment.   (c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
take all necessary actions, including obtaining (i) consents of each holder
of a Company Stock Option or restricted stock of the Company (collectively a
"Company Stock Award") including employees of the Company and of its
Subsidiaries and each of the   6   directors on the Company Board and
each of the directors on the board of directors of any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries, in each case, in their individual capacities and (ii)
resolutions of the Company Board, of the board of directors of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries or of a committee established under the applicable Company
Common Stock Plan, if applicable, to effect the foregoing. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the Company may be required to sell Investment Securities to
fund its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05.   ARTICLE 3   COMPANY

has delivered to the Acquiror a letter (the "Company\'s Disclosure Letter")
setting forth items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either (i) in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or (ii) as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this Article 3; provided that the inclusion of an
item in the Company\'s Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the disclosing party that
such item (or any undisclosed item or information of comparable or greater
significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
with respect to the Company. Except as Previously Disclosed in a paragraph of
the Company\'s Disclosure Letter corresponding to the relevant section below,

forth in its Disclosure Letters and as follows:   3.01 Organization,
Standing and Authority. The Company is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Georgia; and
except where, individually or in the aggregate, the failure to be qualified
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, is duly qualified
to do business and is in good standing in all the jurisdictions where its
ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified. The Company has heretofore furnished to
Acquiror a complete and correct copy of the Company Articles and Company By-
Laws as currently in effect, including all amendments.   3.02 Company Common
Stock. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company

the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein. The Company does
not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders
of the Company on any matter. Except as set forth in Section 3.02 of the
Company\'s Disclosure Letter, there are no shareholders agreements, voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates is a party or by which any of them is
bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the  
7   Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any such agreements
or understandings that may limit in any way the solicitation of proxies by or

of the Company with respect to the Merger) or granting to any Person or group
of Persons the right to elect, or to designate or nominate for election, a
director to the Company Board. There are no programs in place or outstanding

bound to sell or otherwise transfer any securities of any such Subsidiaries
(other than to the Company or its Subsidiaries), (iv) there are no contracts,
commitments, understandings, or arrangements relating to its rights to vote
or to dispose of such securities, and (v) all the equity securities of each
such Subsidiary held by the Company or its Subsidiaries are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries free and clear
of any Liens.   (b) As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries holds securities involving, in the aggregate,
Beneficial Ownership or control by the Company or any such Subsidiary of 5%
or more of any class of the issuer\'s voting securities or 25% or more of any
class of the issuer\'s securities, including a description of any such issuer
and the percentage of the issuer\'s voting and/or non-voting securities.  
(c) Section 3.03(c) of the Company\'s Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date
hereof, all partnerships, limited liability companies, joint ventures or
similar entities, in which it owns or controls, or any of its Subsidiaries
own or control, an equity, partnership or membership interest, directly or
indirectly, and the nature and amount of each such interest.   (d) Each of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization;
and except where, individually or in the aggregate, the failure to be
qualified is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in all the jurisdictions where
its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified.   3.04 Corporate Power. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and to own all its properties and
assets; and the Company has the corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.   3.05 Corporate Authority and
Action.   (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all
corporate action necessary in order (i) to authorize the execution and
delivery of, and performance of its obligations under, this Agreement and
(ii) subject only to receipt of the approval of the plan of merger contained
in this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, to consummate the Merger. This Agreement is a valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors\' rights or by general equity principles).  
8    (b) The Company has taken all action required to be taken by it
in order to exempt this Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from, and this Agreement, the
Shareholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
each is exempt from, the requirements of any applicable "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," or other antitakeover laws and regulation of
any state, including Sections 14-2-1110 to 14-2-1113 and Sections 14-2-1131
to 14-2-1133 of the GBCC (collectively, "Takeover Laws"). As of the date
hereof, the Company Board has adopted a resolution which approves and adopts
this Agreement and the Merger and resolves to recommend that the Company\'s
shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger.   (c) The Company
Financial Advisor has delivered to the Company Board its written opinion,
dated prior to or as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, based
upon and subject to the matters set forth therein and as of the date thereof,
the Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view. The
Company has been authorized by the Company Financial Advisor to permit
inclusion of such opinion (and/or a reference thereto) in the
Proxy Statement.   (d) The only vote of the shareholders the Company
required to adopt the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and approve
the Merger is the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority
of the outstanding Shares (the "Company Requisite Vote"). No other vote of
the shareholders of the Company is required by law, the Company Articles or
Company By-Laws.   3.06 Regulatory Filings; No Defaults.   (a) No
consents or approvals of, filings or registrations with or notices to any
Governmental Authority are required to be made or obtained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery
or performance by the Company of this Agreement, or to consummate the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) filing the
Proxy Statement in definitive form with the Commissioner of Insurance of the
State of Georgia, (ii) the filing of applications and notices with respect to
the Merger, as applicable, with the Georgia Insurance, Safety and Fire
Commissioner, Illinois Insurance Commissioner, Connecticut Insurance
Commissioner, and any other insurance regulatory authorities as may be
necessary or appropriate, (iii) the filing of a notification, if required,
and expiration of the related waiting period under the HSR Act, and (iv) the
filing of articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Georgia pursuant to the GBCC and the Secretary of State of the State of
Illinois pursuant to the IBCA. As of the date hereof, the Company is not
aware of any reason why the approvals of all Governmental Authorities
necessary to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not be received without the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition.   (b) Subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals, and
expiration of the waiting periods, referred to in Section 3.06(a) and the
making of required filings under federal and state securities laws and except
as set forth in Section 3.06(b) of the Company\'s Disclosure Letter, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) conflict with,
constitute a breach or violation of, result in a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or
give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies or any right of
termination under, any Contract to which the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, including the Company Contracts, (ii) constitute a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Company Articles or the
Company By-Laws, or (iii) violate any law, rule, or regulation or any
judgment, decree, order or Company Permit; except, in the case of clause (i)
or (iii) for such breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations, Liens or
violations which, individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect.   9    3.07 SEC Documents; Financial

superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then did not as
of the date of such filing) and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company

waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate

most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of
the assets of such Company Pension Plan. Except as set forth in Section
3.14(f) of the Company\'s Disclosure Letter, under each of the Company
Pension Plans, there has been no adverse change in the financial condition of

its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Compensation Plan which would increase the expense of maintaining
such Compensation Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year (other than as a result of normal increase and
decrease in the number and compensation of the Compensation Plan participants
through attrition and hiring in the ordinary course of business of the
Company). Except as set for in Section 3.14(h) of the Company\'s Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this

done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall reasonably cooperate with the other party
hereto to that end. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent or approval of all Persons party to a Contract with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent such consent or approval is
required in order to consummate the Merger or for the Surviving Corporation

nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree (a) to limit in any
manner or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the shares of Company Common Stock), or to divest, dispose of or
hold separate any securities or all or any portion of their respective
businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, assets or properties
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) to limit in any material

applicable stock exchange rules, the Company Articles and the Company By-
Laws, all action necessary to convene an appropriate meeting of shareholders
of the Company to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and
any other matters required to be approved by the Company\'s shareholders for
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any adjournment or postponement, the "Company Meeting"), and to
solicit shareholder approval, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof. The Company Board has adopted a resolution contemplated by GBCC
Section 14-2-1103, recommending that the shareholders approve this Agreement
(and will, subject to the provisions of Section 5.07, keep such resolution in
effect) and take any other action required to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The obligation of the Company to hold the
Company Meeting shall not be affected by any Acquisition Proposal or other
event or circumstance. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.07, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from shareholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Acquiror, advisable to
secure any vote of shareholders required by the GBCC to effect the
Merger.   5.04 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after execution
of this Agreement, the Acquiror and the Company will cooperate in the
preparation of a proxy statement and other proxy solicitation materials of
the Company, including amendments and supplements thereto (the "Proxy
Statement") regarding the   26   solicitation of proxies to be voted in
favor of the Merger. The Company agrees, subject to the review and approval
of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, to file the Proxy Statement in preliminary form
with the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Georgia as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement, shall provide Acquiror and

and Acquiror Sub, respond promptly to any such comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement, file the Proxy Statement in definitive form and cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s shareholders at the earliest
practicable date. The Proxy Statement shall contain subject to the provisions
of Section 5.07, (i) the recommendation of the Company Board that
the Company\'s shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger
and any other matters determined to be appropriate for submission to
shareholders for approval to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) the written opinion of the Company Financial Advisor, dated prior to
or as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, based upon and
subject to the matters set forth therein and as of the date thereof, the
Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view. The
Company will advise Acquiror promptly of the time when the Proxy Statement
and any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement has been filed, and of
any request by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Georgia or its
staff (and/or the SEC or its staff, if applicable) for amendment of the Proxy
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Georgia or its staff (and/or the
SEC or its staff, if applicable) for additional information.   (a) The
Company hereby represents, warrants, agrees and covenants that: (i) the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act (if
applicable), the GBCC and Georgia Insurance Securities Laws; (ii) the Proxy

the SEC, if applicable) or first sent to holders of the Company Common Stock,
(2) at the time of the Company Meeting (if any) or (3) at the Effective Time
or (B) in the case of other communications by the Company with respect to

fact or omit to state any material fact (y) required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (z) necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier filing by the Company with the
Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Georgia or the SEC or communication
from the Company to the holders of Common Stock with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company
Meeting that has become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company makes no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with
respect to any information that has been supplied by Acquiror, Acquiror
Sub or any of their accountants, counsel or other authorized Representatives
in writing specifically for use in any of the foregoing documents.   (b)
The Acquiror herby represents, warrants, agrees and covenants that the
information supplied in writing by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any of their
accountants, counsel or other authorized Representatives in
writing specifically for use in any of the Proxy Statement (the "Acquiror
Information") will not, (i) in the case of the Proxy Statement (A) at the
time the Proxy Statement is filed with the Commissioner of Insurance of the
State of Georgia (and/or the SEC, if applicable) or first sent to
shareholders, (B) at the time of the Company Meeting or (C) at the Effective
Time, or (ii) in the case of other communications by the Company to the

filing by the Company with the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of
Georgia or the SEC or communication from the Company to the holders of
Company Common Stock with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the
transactions contemplated   27   hereby or the Company Meeting that has
become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquiror makes
no representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to any
information that has not been supplied by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any of
their accountants, counsel or other authorized Representatives in writing
specifically for use in any of the foregoing documents.   5.05 Press
Releases. The initial press release concerning the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release in
such form agreed to in advance by the parties, and thereafter each of the
Company and the Acquiror agrees that it will not, without the prior approval
of the other party, issue any press release or written statement for general
circulation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby (except for any
release or statement that, in the written opinion of outside counsel to the
Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be, is required by law or regulation
and as to which the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be, has used its
reasonable best efforts to discuss with the other in advance, provided that
such release or statement has not been caused by, or is not the result of, a
previous disclosure by or at the direction of the Company or the Acquiror, as
the case may be, or any of its Representatives that was not permitted by this
Agreement).   5.06 Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each party hereto
shall afford the other party and its officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized Representatives, such access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the
books, records (including credit files, Tax Returns and work papers of
independent auditors), properties, personnel and such other information as
such party may reasonably request and, during such period, each party hereto
shall furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each material report,
schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities or insurance regulatory laws, and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
may reasonably request. Each of the Acquiror and the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the consummation of the Merger, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the performance by the
parties of their obligations under this Agreement will not result in any
breach of (i) any applicable law concerning the protection of confidential
personal information received from individual policyholders or other
customers or (ii) the privacy policy of the Company or the privacy policy of
the Acquiror. No investigation by Acquiror or Acquiror Sub of the business
and affairs of the Company or its subsidiaries shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to Acquiror\'s or Acquiror Sub\'s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   5.07 No
Solicitation.   (a) Until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.01 (and the payments, if any, required to be made in
connection with such termination pursuant to Section 7.03 have been made),
the Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, employees, consultants, Representatives, Affiliates and
other agents, including, but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys
and accountants (collectively, the "Company Representatives"), not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate the
making of, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries regarding the
making of, any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, by taking
any action that would make any Takeover Laws inapplicable to an Acquisition
Proposal), (ii) participate in any way in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish or disclose any information or afford any access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
any Person (other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub or any of their Affiliates or
associates) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub the approval and recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement
(a "Change in Recommendation"), (iv) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(unless contemporaneously with such approval or recommendation the Company
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(d)), (v) release
any third party from any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party or fail to enforce to the fullest extent  
28   possible, or grant any waiver, request or consent to any Acquisition
Proposal under, any such agreement, or (vi) enter into any agreement, letter
of intent or similar document contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that this Section 5.07 shall not
prohibit the Company or the Company Representatives from:   (A) (i) subject
to the conditions of Section 5.05, issuing a press release or otherwise
publicly disclosing the terms of this Agreement (including the provisions of
this Section 5.07), the Merger or any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) proceeding
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) communicating to
the holders of the Company\'s securities a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iv) making any disclosure to
the holders of the Company\'s securities which, in the judgment of the
Board of Directors (after receiving the advice of legal counsel) is necessary
to be made under applicable law (including laws relating to the fiduciary
duties of directors); or   (B) participating in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnishing or disclosing nonpublic information to or entering into
any confidentiality or standstill or similar agreements with, any Person in
response to an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that
is submitted to the Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement
if (i) such Acquisition Proposal does not result from a violation of any of
the provisions of this Section 5.07, (ii) a majority of the members of the
Company Board determines in good faith, after having received the advice of
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Person is
reasonably capable, financially and otherwise, of consummating such
Acquisition Proposal, (y) such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (z) failure to do so would result in a breach
of the fiduciary duty of the Company Board to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable law, and (iii) prior to participating in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic information to,
such Person, the Company gives Acquiror written notice of the identity of
such Person and of the Company\'s intention to participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, such
Person, and the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less restrictive than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.   (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any other
parties that may be ongoing as of the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.07 shall
prohibit Acquiror or Acquiror Sub from purchasing the shares of Company
Common Stock or consummating the Merger. Without limiting any other rights of
Acquiror or Acquiror Sub under this Agreement in respect of any such action,
neither any withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of the approval
or recommendation of the Merger nor the termination of this Agreement shall
have any effect on the approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for
the purpose of causing the Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to, this
Agreement and the Shareholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, which approvals and actions are irrevocable.   (d)
Nothing contained in this Section 5.07 or any other provision of this
Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from notifying any
third party that contacts the Company on an unsolicited basis after the
date hereof concerning an Acquisition Proposal of the Company\'s obligations
under this Section 5.07.   5.08 Takeover Laws. No party shall knowingly
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Shareholder Agreements to be subject to requirements imposed
by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect.   29    5.09 No Rights Triggered. The Company shall take all
reasonable steps necessary to ensure that (a) the entering into of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and any other action or combination of actions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to
any Person under the Company Articles or the Company By-Laws and (b)
appropriate waivers, consents, amendments or modifications, as applicable, in
a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, have been obtained prior to the
Closing Date with respect to those Contracts set forth in Section 5.09 of the
Company\'s Disclosure Letter necessary to ensure that (i) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not conflict with,
constitute a breach or violation of, result in a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or
give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies or any right
of termination under, such Contract and (ii) such Contracts will,
after consummation of the Merger, (assuming due power and authority of, and
due execution and delivery by, the other party or parties thereto), be valid
and binding upon the Surviving Corporation or the Company\'s Subsidiary party
thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other
similar laws effecting or relating to enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally, or by general principles of equity, in full force and effect or
where the failure to obtain such consent, individually or in the aggregate,
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   5.10

herein, the Acquiror and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all

In exercising the foregoing right, each party agrees to act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each of the Acquiror and the Company agrees that it

liability set forth in the Company Articles and Company By-Laws on the date
of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of five years from the Effective Time in any

by law.   (b) For five years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, in respect of acts or

Each of the Company and the Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the other of
any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.  
5.13 Employee Benefits.   (a) The Acquiror and the Company agree that all
employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
employed by the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time;

employees and Multi-Line Exclusive Agents of the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to be entitled to and shall receive the same benefits currently
provided the   31   employees or Multi-Line Exclusive agents, as
applicable, of the Company under its existing Compensation Plans so long as
the continued provision of benefits to such employees under the Company\'s
Compensation Plans does not cause any Acquirer Compensation Plan (as defined
in Section 5.13(d) below) to be in violation of any law or regulation
governing such plans.   (c) Subject, in the case of an employee with a
Specific Employment Agreement, to the terms of the applicable Specific
Employment Agreement, the Acquirer Compensation Plans shall provide all
employees and Multi-Line Exclusive Agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries, or their respective predecessors (or any other party for which
seniority or service has been recognized under the Company\'s Compensation
Plans) prior to the Closing Date for all purposes (other than benefit accrual
under a retirement plan) for which such seniority or service was recognized
by the Company\'s Compensation Plans prior to the Closing Date, including but
not limited to eligibility to participate, vesting in benefits accrued while
participating in such Acquirer Compensation Plans, and the rate at which
benefits accrue while participating in such Acquirer Compensation Plans.

compensation, commission-based, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift,
savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted
stock, stock appreciation and stock option plans, all employment or severance
contracts, all medical, dental, disability, severance, health and life plans,

arrangement maintained or contributed to by the Acquirer or any ERISA
Affiliate of the Acquirer, as applicable, for the benefit of current
or former officers, employees, directors or agents or the beneficiaries
or dependents of the foregoing.   (e) The Acquirer and the Company agree
that paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5.13 do not create
any rights with respect to any third party, but is merely an expression of
the current understanding with respect to these matters.   (f) Except with
respect to employees with a Specific Employment Agreement, Acquiror agrees
that, on or after the Closing Date, with respect to the termination of
employment of any employee currently employed by the Company prior to
December 31, 2004, the Surviving Corporation will provide an employee whose
employment is to be terminated (other than for cause) thirty days
notice prior to the date of such termination.   5.14 Certain Contracts.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Contracts with third parties that are identified by Acquiror to
