WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company and Merger Sub have
approved and declared advisable, and the board of directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub

agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date on which the Merger
Closing occurs being the "Merger Closing Date"); provided, that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, the parties shall not be required to effect the Merger Closing
until the earlier of (i) September 30, 2015 (or, if the Required Information

such date, then the date on which the Required Information becomes Compliant)
and (ii) the final day of any Marketing Period.

Section 1.3. Effective Time. Simultaneously with the Merger Closing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger (the

with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of
State"), in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at
which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State or at such subsequent date and/or time as is agreed between the parties
and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4. Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company

provided by Law, in each case, consistent with the obligations set forth in
Section 5.7.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be

terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by Law, in each case, consistent with the obligations set forth in

Section 1.7. Officers. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1. Effect on Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) Cancellation of Company Securities. Each share of the Company's common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Common Stock") held by the
Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

(b) Conversion of Company Securities. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares described in Section
2.1(a) and, except as provided in Section 2.6, the Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $80.25 per
share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common
Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common
Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration.

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
subject to Section 5.1(a), if at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
Shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such change.



Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the "Paying Agent"),
the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.1(b). As of or immediately following the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (such cash
amount excluding any interest or other earnings thereon, collectively, the
"Payment Fund"). In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to make
the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(b), Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure
that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to make such payments. Parent shall
cause the Payment Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) and (ii) applied
promptly to making the payments pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.3(b).
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.3(b), except as expressly provided for
in this Agreement.

(b) Letters of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (and, in any event, not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or
otherwise provide to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares described in Section 2.1(a)
and, except as provided in Section 2.6, the Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent or,
with respect to Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's
message" in customary form or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request, and which letter of transmittal shall be in the form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this
Agreement.

(c) Surrender of Certificates; Payment. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form or such
other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request with respect to
Book-Entry Shares, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed or
delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder, within two
(2) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or
(ii) the Paying Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in
customary form or such other evidence as the Paying Agent



may reasonably request with respect to Book-Entry Shares, together with the
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the Company Common
Shares formerly represented by the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any applicable stock
transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

(d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one
(1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration, without
interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the
date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any transnational, United
States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, or any governmental,
regulatory, police, executive, taxing, judicial or administrative authority,
department, court, tribunal, board, bureau, official, arbitral body, agency,
commission or any non-governmental self-regulatory authority (including any
stock exchange) (each, a "Governmental Authority"), any such cash in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided, that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
Article II, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) in an amount sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.3(b) and (ii) such investments shall
only be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than thirty days (30) or guaranteed by the United



States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

Section 2.3. Company Equity Awards. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time (as defined below), the board of directors of the Company (the "Company
Board") (or a duly constituted committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions
and take all such other actions that do not involve payments by the Company
(other than any payments contemplated or required hereunder) as may be
required to provide for the following:

(a) Treatment of Options. As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan or
otherwise (each, a "Company Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an
option to purchase from Parent, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Company Option, that number of shares of common stock of
Parent, par value $0.01 (the "Parent Common Stock") (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to (x) the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (B) the quotient
obtained by dividing (i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the Parent
Measurement Price (such quotient, the "Exchange Ratio"), at an exercise price
per Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option by (ii) the Exchange Ratio (each,
as so adjusted, a "Converted Parent Option"); provided, that in the case of
any Company Options to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the
Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code,
the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code. All rounding described in this Section 2.3(a) shall be done on an
aggregate basis. The Converted Parent Options shall have the same vesting
schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company
Equity Plans or an applicable award agreement) as the Company Options and
otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Company Options; provided, that Parent shall convert Company Options into
Converted Parent Options in a manner that would not cause the Converted Parent
Options to be treated as the grant of a new stock right for purposes of
Section 409A of the Code.

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a
Company Equity Plan or otherwise and subject to restrictions on transfer
and/or forfeiture (other than any Company Performance Award) ("Company
Restricted Stock"), shall become vested and all restrictions thereon shall
lapse, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the equity plan and/or
award agreement governing such Company Restricted Stock as in effect on the
date hereof, and upon the Effective Time, each such share of Company
Restricted Stock shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.1(b); provided that, to the extent
a Company Restricted Stock would not otherwise vest in accordance with the
terms of the equity



plan and/or award agreement such Company Restricted Stock shall be converted
into that number of shares of restricted stock of Parent Common Stock (the
"Converted Restricted Stock") equal to the product of (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such award of Company Restricted Stock and
(B) the Exchange Ratio. Any Converted Restricted Stock issued pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b) shall have the same vesting schedule (including any
acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Equity Plans or an
applicable award agreement) as the Company Restricted Stock and otherwise
shall have the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Restricted Stock.

(c) Treatment of Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time,
each Company restricted stock unit (other than any Company Performance Award)
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company
Restricted Stock Unit"), whether or not then vested, shall be converted into
that number of restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock ("Converted
Restricted Stock Unit") equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such award of Company Restricted Share Units
and (B) the Exchange Ratio. Any Converted Restricted Stock Units issued
pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Equity Plans
or an applicable award agreement) as the Company Restricted Stock Units and
otherwise shall have the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Company Restricted Stock Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
any Company Restricted Stock Unit that is vested or vests upon the Effective
Time and would otherwise be settled in accordance with the terms of such
Company Restricted Stock Unit upon the Effective Time, such Company Restricted
Stock Unit shall be cancelled at, the Effective Time (each, a "Cancelled
RSU"), and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each
former holder of any such Cancelled RSU, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (or such later time as required by the applicable
award agreement, any deferral agreement with respect to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit or as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax
consequences under Section 409A of the Code), an amount in cash, without
interest and less any required withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (i)
the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cancelled RSU.

(d) Treatment of Performance Awards. At the Effective Time, each Company
performance-based restricted stock unit award, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Performance Award" and,
collectively with the Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company
Restricted Stock Units, the "Company Equity Awards"), shall be converted into
that number of restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock ("Converted
Performance Award") equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Awards (provided,
that if the performance period ends on or prior to the Effective Date, in
accordance with the terms of any award agreement, this (A) shall equal the
number of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the achievement of the
performance goals through the Effective Time) and (B) the Exchange Ratio. Any
Converted Performance Awards issued pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
Performance Award; provided, however, vesting provisions relating to
achievement of performance targets shall be subject to revision, in the
reasonable discretion of Parent, following the Closing in order to
appropriately reflect the acquisition by Parent and changes to the business of
the Company as



a result thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company
Performance Award that vests and would otherwise be settled in accordance with
the terms of such Company Performance Award upon the Effective Time, such
Performance Award shall be cancelled at, the Effective Time (each, a
"Cancelled Performance Award"), and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such Cancelled Performance
Award, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (or such
later time as required by the applicable award agreement, any deferral
agreement with respect to such Company Performance Award or as necessary to
avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the
Code), an amount in cash, without interest and less any required withholding
Taxes, equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Cancelled Performance Award
in accordance with the terms of such award agreements.

(e) Except as set forth on Section 2.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company Equity Awards shall be converted in accordance with Sections
2.3(a) through 2.3(d) of this Agreement.

(f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future
issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient for delivery
upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Parent Options, Converted
Restricted Stock, Converted Restricted Stock Units and Converted Performance
Awards. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file
with the SEC an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
applicable form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Converted Parent Options, Converted Restricted Stock, Converted Restricted
Stock Units and Converted Performance Awards and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Converted Parent Options,
Converted Restricted Stock, Converted Restricted Stock Units and Converted
Performance Awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.4. ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions (including, if appropriate,
amending the terms of the IPC The Hospitalist Company, Inc. Nonqualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Amended and Restated (the "ESPP")) that may be
necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable Law to ensure that (A)
except for the offering period under the ESPP that commenced on January 1,
2015 (the "Final Offering"), no offering period shall be authorized or
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement; (B) if, with respect to the
Final Offering, the Effective Time shall occur prior to December 31, 2015
(which is the Exercise Date, as defined in the ESPP), (i) each individual
participating in the Final Offering shall receive notice of the Merger no
later than 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Time and shall have an
opportunity to terminate his or her outstanding purchase rights under the
ESPP, (ii) the Final Offering shall end immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) any remaining accumulated but unused payroll deductions shall
be distributed to the relevant participants without interest as promptly as
practicable following such termination; (C) each ESPP participant's
accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of
Common Stock in accordance with and subject to the terms of the ESPP as of the
end of the Final Offering; and (D) the ESPP shall terminate in its entirety
immediately



prior to the Effective Time and no further rights shall be granted or
exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

Section 2.5. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.6. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), to the extent
that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly demanded appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead the holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however,
that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to be made with respect
to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation, and the
aggregate Merger Consideration (and Payment Fund) shall be reduced, on a
dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not
been a stockholder on the Merger Closing Date. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
of the shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or other applicable Law and
received by the Company or its Representatives with respect thereto, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or other applicable Law.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.7. No Further Ownership Rights. All cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in Section 2.1(b), for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.



Section 2.8. Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable hereunder any amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
holder from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so deducted and
withheld.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in (a) the forms, statements, schedules, reports or other
documents (including exhibits and all information incorporated by reference
therein) filed or furnished on or after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date
hereof by the Company with or to the SEC (collectively, including any
amendments thereto, to the extent available on the SEC's EDGAR system prior to
the date hereof, the "Filed Company SEC Documents"), other than any
disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking
Statements" and any other disclosures contained therein that are predictive,
cautionary or forward looking in nature, but being understood and agreed that
this clause (a) shall not apply to any of Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section
3.9, Section 3.11(b), Section 3.21, Section 3.22, Section 3.23 or Section
3.24, or (b) the corresponding section of the separate disclosure letter (it
being understood that disclosure of any item in any section of such disclosure
letter shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on
its face (other than Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.9, Section 3.11(b),
Section 3.21, Section 3.22, Section 3.23 or Section 3.24, which matters shall
only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the respective corresponding
section of such disclosure letter)) delivered by the Company to Parent on the
date hereof (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent as follows:

Section 3.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) Each of the Company, its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities is a
corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing), under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization or
formation and has the requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability
company power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such power, authority and
governmental approvals would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company, its subsidiaries and its
Affiliated Entities is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or
legal entity to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing), in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or to be in good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Affiliated
Entities" means any affiliated entity of the Company or its



subsidiaries, including any professional corporation, partnership or
association, the results of which are consolidated with those of the Company
in the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each
subsidiary and Affiliated Entity of the Company. Section 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter also sets forth the jurisdiction of organization of each
subsidiary and Affiliated Entity of the Company and the class, number and
percentage of outstanding equity interests (including partnership interests
and limited liability company interests) owned by the Company or its
subsidiaries and any other Person. Except for such subsidiaries disclosed in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other voting or equity securities
or interests in any Person.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means
any change, event, circumstance, effect or occurrence (whether or not
constituting a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement) that, individually or in the aggregate with any such other
changes, events, circumstances, effects or occurrences, (1) has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the assets,
liabilities, business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities taken as a whole, or (2)
would prevent or materially impair or delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than (in the case of clause (1) above) any change,
event, circumstance, effect or occurrence resulting from (i) changes in
general economic, business or geopolitical conditions, or in the financial,
credit or securities markets in general (including changes in interest rates
or exchange rates) in any country or region in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities conducts business; (ii) general changes or
developments in the industries in which the Company or its subsidiaries or
Affiliated Entities operate; (iii) changes, after the date of this Agreement,
in Laws applicable to the Company, its subsidiaries, Affiliated Entities or
any of their respective properties or assets or changes, after the date of
this Agreement, in GAAP or rules and policies of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board; (iv) any natural or man-made disasters or acts of war
(whether or not declared), sabotage or terrorism, or armed hostilities, or any
escalation or worsening thereof, in each case occurring after the date of this
Agreement; (v) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Shares,
in and of itself, or any failure to meet internal or published projections,
forecasts, budgets, estimates or expectations of the Company's revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any
period (provided, that the underlying cause of any such change or failure
shall not be excluded pursuant to this exception (v)); (vi) any loss of, or
change in, the relationship of the Company or any of the Company's
subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities, contractual or otherwise, with its
customers, suppliers, vendors, lenders, employees, investors, or venture
partners arising out of or related to the announcement or performance of this
Agreement or the identity of Parent, other than for purposes of the
representations in Section 3.5 and the related closing condition in Section
6.2(a) and termination right in Section 7.1(d); or (vii) any litigation
initiated by stockholders of the Company arising from allegations of a breach
of fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law solely arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; except in the cases of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and/or (iv) above,
to the extent that the



Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities, taken as a whole, are
disproportionately affected thereby as compared with other participants in the
industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities
operate (in which case the incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or is reasonably
expected to be, a Company Material Adverse Effect). For the avoidance of the
doubt, notwithstanding anything disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither (i) the receipt of notice following the
date of this Agreement from any Governmental Authority of a criminal
investigation relating to the Company's or any of its subsidiaries',
Affiliated Entities' or Affiliated Providers' participation in any state or
federal healthcare programs or (ii) the receipt of notice following the date
of this Agreement of the initiation of any criminal, civil or administrative
action under any federal or state debarment authority relating to the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries', Affiliated Entities' or Affiliated
Providers' ability to participate in any state or federal healthcare programs
shall be excluded from the determination of whether or not a Company Material
Adverse Effect exists.

Section 3.2. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation (as amended to date, the "Certificate of Incorporation") and
bylaws (as amended to date, the "Bylaws") of the Company and the equivalent
organizational or governing documents of each "significant subsidiary" (as
defined below), as currently in effect. The Certificate of Incorporation and
the Bylaws are in full force and effect on the date of this Agreement. None of
the Company or any of its "significant subsidiaries", its Affiliated Entities
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the other parties thereto, is in
violation of any provision of such organizational or governing documents,
except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.3. Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). At the close of
business on August 2, 2015 (the "Measurement Date"), (i) 17,416,132 shares of
Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) were issued and

Company, Inc.), the IPC The Hospitalist Company, Inc. 2007 Equity

to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities is a
party or by which they are bound is (a) a valid and binding obligation of the
Company or one of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities, as applicable, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, is in full force and effect and enforceable
against the other party or parties thereto in accordance with its terms
(except to the extent that any Company Material Contract expires or has
expired in accordance with its terms), and (b) to the knowledge of the
Company, a valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto and is in
full force and effect and enforceable against such other parties in accordance
with its terms, except, in each case, as would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that (x)

such Company Material Contract. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity of the Company is in breach of or default under the terms of
any Company Material Contract where such breach or default would have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company Material Contract is
in material breach of or default under the terms of any Company Material
Contract where such material breach or default would have, individually or in

Section 3.19. Real Property. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or

other agreement under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or

case, whether as landlord, tenant, sublandlord, subtenant or by other
occupancy arrangement), or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the
future, any real property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens). Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, each real property lease of the Company and its
subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities (A) is a valid and binding obligation of
the Company or the subsidiary or Affiliated Entity party thereto and, to the
knowledge of the Company, of each other party thereto, and is in full force
and effect, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to
creditors' rights generally, and (B) to the knowledge of the Company, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the giving of notice, the
passage of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default under any such
real property lease.

Section 3.20. Insurance. Except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) all material insurance
policies maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliated
Entities are in full force and effect, and all premiums due and payable
thereon have been paid in accordance with the terms of such policies, and (b)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities is in
breach or default of any of the material insurance policies, and neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities has taken any
action, or failed to take any action, which, with notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination or
modification of any of the material insurance policies. During the twelve (12)
months preceding the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities has received any written notice of
termination or cancellation (other than non-renewal notices in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice) or, as of the date hereof,
denial of coverage with respect to any material insurance policy currently
maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities of
any material claim made pursuant to any such insurance policy.

Section 3.21. Opinion of Financial Advisors. The Company Board has received
the opinion of each of the Financial Advisors, on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered in
connection with the preparation of the opinion, the consideration to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates. Promptly after receipt of the written
opinions, the Company will deliver copies of such written opinions to Parent
solely for informational purposes. It is understood and agreed that each such
opinion is solely for the use and benefit of the Company Board and may not be
relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 3.22. Takeover Statutes. Assuming the accuracy of the representation
contained in Section 4.7, the Company Board has taken such actions and votes
as are necessary to render the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or any



other takeover or anti-takeover statute or similar federal or state Law,
including Section 203 of the DGCL (collectively, "Takeover Statutes")
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.23. Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of
outstanding Company Common Stock representing at least a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast thereupon by holders of Company Common Stock (the
"Requisite Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of holders of securities of
the Company that is necessary to adopt this Agreement or approve the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.24. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Evercore Group L.L.C.) (the "Financial
Advisors") is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission
in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities.

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Except as set forth in (a) the forms, statements, schedules, reports or other
documents (including exhibits and all information incorporated by reference
therein) filed or furnished on or after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date
hereof by Parent with or to the SEC (collectively, including any amendments
thereto, to the extent available on the SEC's EDGAR system prior to the date
hereof, the "Filed Parent SEC Documents "), other than any disclosures
contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements"
and any other disclosures contained therein that are predictive, cautionary or
forward looking in nature, but being understood and agreed that this clause
(a) shall not apply to any of Section 4.3, Section 4.7, or Section 4.8, or (b)
the corresponding section of the separate disclosure letter (it being
understood that disclosure of any item in any section of such disclosure
letter shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on
its face (other than Section 4.3, Section 4.7 or Section 4.8, which matters
shall only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the respective corresponding
section of such disclosure letter)) delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the
Company on the date hereof (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), the Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed, validly
existing and in good standing, under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failures to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing would not have, individually or in the



aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, event, effect or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Termination Date.

Section 4.2. Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents. Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents), and other organizational or governing
documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to date, of each of
Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the "Parent Organizational Documents").
The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and effect. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties
thereto are in violation of any provision of the Parent Organizational
Documents, as applicable, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3. Authority Relative to Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated by
this Agreement and to be executed by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(collectively, the "Parent Documents"), to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and each
Parent Document and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Parent and
Merger Sub (other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub), and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Parent Documents or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger (other than, with respect
to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State). This Agreement and each of the Parent Documents have been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights, and to
general equitable principles).

Section 4.4. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Parent
Documents by Parent and/or Merger Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger,
or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof will (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of Parent or
Merger Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and authorizations specified
in



Section 4.4(b) have been received and the waiting periods referred to therein
have expired, and any condition precedent to such consent, approval,
authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent
or Merger Sub is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or
any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such violations, breaches, defaults,
rights, terminations, amendments, accelerations, or cancellations which would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the Parent Documents, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or
compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of this
Agreement or the Parent Documents will require any consent, approval,
authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority, except for (i) applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws, any applicable Antitrust Laws, filing
and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and
the rules of NASDAQ, and (ii) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5. Absence of Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective properties or assets, at law or in equity, and there
are no Orders by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority, in each
case, that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.6. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in writing expressly for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

Section 4.7. Merger Sub Capitalization. As of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value
$0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and has not conducted any business prior to
the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets,
liabilities or obligations of any



nature other than those incident to each of Parent and Merger Sub's formation
and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.8. Funds. As of the Merger Closing Date, Parent will have, and will
cause Merger Sub to have, available the funds necessary to, consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including payment in cash of the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Article II and
payment of all related fees and expenses. Parent acknowledges that its
obligations under this Agreement are not contingent or conditioned in any
manner on obtaining any financing.

Section 4.9. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and MTS Health Partners, L.P.) is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other similar fee or commission in connection with
the Merger and any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 4.10. Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities. Assuming (i) that the Company is Solvent
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and for the avoidance of doubt,
before giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Merger (as applicable) and (iii) the accuracy as
of the Effective Time of the representations and warranties of the Company in
Article III in all material respects (but without giving effect to any
knowledge, materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or
exception contained therein), the Surviving Corporation will, after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, all amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3 and all associated costs and expenses of the Merger
(including any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of the Company
required in connection therewith) and all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, be Solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in
this Section 4.6, the term "Solvent" means, with respect to a particular date,
that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of a person
(on a consolidated basis) will exceed such person's debts, (b) such person (on
a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries) has not incurred and does not
intend to incur, and does not believe that it will incur, debts beyond its
ability to pay such debts as such debts mature in the ordinary course of
business and (c) such person (on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries)
has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For
purposes of this Section 4.6, "debt" means any liability on a claim, and
"claim" means any (y) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (z) any
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives
rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced

following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. Except as expressly contemplated by Section 5.6, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger,
a summary of the opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors provided for in
Section 3.21 (and, subject to the receipt of any required consent from the
Company's Financial Advisors, copies of such opinions) and a copy of Section
262 of the DGCL. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement and
to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the Staff of the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing. The Proxy Statement (and any amendments or
supplements thereto) shall comply in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ and, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement, at the
time of the publishing or mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders' Meeting, to not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made
by the Company with respect to written information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

(b) Mailing of Proxy Statement; Amendments. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record
date established for the meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval (the "Stockholders' Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that
it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or
any of the Company's or Parent's subsidiaries, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which,
pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other
party and, subject to Section 5.3, the Company will promptly file such
amendment and/or circulate such supplement, as appropriate. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or
misleading.



(c) Cooperation. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC). Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response and shall in good faith consider such comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

Section 5.3. Stockholders' Meeting. The Company (a) shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement, take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law, the rules of NASDAQ and the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws to establish a record date and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, which Stockholders' Meeting,
except as may be required by applicable Law or an Order of any Governmental
Authority, shall be set for a date no later than 30 calendar days following
the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders and (b)
shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except pursuant to the
immediately following sentence; provided, that the Stockholders' Meeting shall
in no event be postponed, recessed or adjourned pursuant to the following
sentence to a date that is more than 30 calendar days after the date on which
the Stockholders' Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled
without the prior written consent of Parent (solely with respect to clause (i)
in such following sentence, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, any adjournments or postponements of such meeting shall
require the prior written consent of Parent, except that (i) the Company may
adjourn the Stockholder Meeting in the case and then only to the extent that
such adjournment is required in order to file and mail any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) has instructed the
Company is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior
to the Stockholders' Meeting, and (ii) the Company, after consultation with
Parent, may (or upon the written request of Parent, shall) adjourn or postpone
the Stockholders' Meeting if as of the time for which the Stockholders'
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are either (A) insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at
the Stockholders' Meeting or (B) insufficient affirmative votes to adopt this
Agreement; provided, that the record date shall not be changed without
Parent's prior written consent. Unless the Company Board shall have effected
an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted in accordance with Section 5.6,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval including by actively soliciting proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all
applicable Laws and all rules of NASDAQ. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, an
Adverse Recommendation Change (or a proposed or announced intention to do so)
shall not relieve the



Company of its obligation hereunder to give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders' Meeting or to provide Parent with such information and
cooperation to permit Parent to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10)
Business Days prior to the scheduled date of the Stockholders' Meeting as to
the aggregate tally of affirmative proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as required by applicable Law, the adoption of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and related matters
shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the Company
shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Stockholders' Meeting.

an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions, including the Merger,
performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this

consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or
consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and

Business Days) following the date hereof, make its respective filings under
the HSR Act, and thereafter (I) make any other required submission under the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and (II) subject to Section 5.4(b) take all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination or the applicable

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 5.4(a),
Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every
impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,



approvals and waivers under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, with competent jurisdiction, so as to
enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date), including (i)
proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if such Merger is
consummated, committing to and effecting), by Order, consent decree, hold
separate order, trust, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license,
disposition or hold separate of such assets or businesses of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates, or otherwise offering to take or offering to
commit to take any action (including any action that limits its freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or
hold, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates) to the extent legally permissible, and

"Regulatory Divestiture") (provided, that no party shall be obligated to take
any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), in each case, as may be necessary, required or advisable in order to
obtain clearance under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of or to vacate or lift, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of
restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid the commencement of any
action or proceeding that seeks to prohibit the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that in no event shall
Parent be required to take or commit to any Regulatory Divestiture if such
action would or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the assets, business, results of operations or financial condition of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their subsidiaries taken as a whole. In
the event that any Governmental Authority requires the divestiture or the
holding separate by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates of any
assets or businesses, no adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration
and Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates shall be required to divest such
assets and businesses, or hold them separate, as the case may be, following
the Merger Closing.

(c) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall (i) promptly notify and furnish the other Party copies

or permit any of its affiliates, Affiliated Entities or Representatives to,
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation, inquiry or any other
matter contemplated by this Section 5.4 or any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall give (or shall cause its
respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts,
to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by Section 5.4(a) and Section
5.4(b) that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any Third Party consents pursuant to
this Section 5.4(d) shall not, in and of itself, be considered a condition to
the obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

Section 5.5. Access to Information; Confidentiality. From the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, (y) upon reasonable prior
notice and (z) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company will
provide to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Company's and its subsidiaries' and the Affiliated
Entities' officers, employees, agents, properties, books, contracts and
records and other information as Parent may reasonably request regarding the
business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects (including, subject
to execution of appropriate joint defense and similar agreements, any pending
litigation or the settlement thereof) of the Company and its subsidiaries and
the Affiliated Entities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement with any person
or group other than Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates (each such person
or group, a "Third Party") entered into prior to the date hereof in any
material respect, (ii) constitute a waiver of or otherwise jeopardize the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company so long as the Company
has taken all reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such
information and to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by
Parent and its Representatives based on such information on a basis that does
not compromise the Company's attorney-client or other privilege with respect
thereto, or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries of their normal duties. The parties shall comply
with, and shall cause their



respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.6. Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.6, from and after the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, (i) the Company shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities and its and their
respective Representatives to (A) cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, discussion or negotiation or other activities with any Third
Parties with respect to a Competing Proposal, and (B) request any such Third
Party or any other Third Party that prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a Competing
Proposal to promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning
the Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities; and (ii) the Company
shall not, shall cause its subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities not to, shall
not permit its and its subsidiaries' and Affiliated Entities' respective
Representatives to, and shall direct its and its subsidiaries' and Affiliated
Entities' respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by
providing information or granting any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement or Takeover Statutes or otherwise) any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal, (B) engage, continue or participate
in any discussions (except to notify such Third Party of the existence of this
Section 5.6) or negotiations concerning, or furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities to,
or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or its
subsidiaries and Affiliated Entities to, any Third Party relating to a
Competing Proposal or any offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Competing Proposal or any Third Party that, to the knowledge of
the Company, is seeking to make, or has made, a Competing Proposal, (C)
approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") or (D) resolve to propose, agree or publically announce an
intention to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after
the date of this Agreement until obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
if the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal
from any Third Party which did not, directly or indirectly, arise from any
breach of Section 5.6(a), the Company or the Company Board, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, may, (i) contact such Third Party to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) furnish non-public information
to such Third Party (provided, however, that (A) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) any non-public information concerning the
Company or its subsidiaries or the Affiliated Entities provided to any Third
Party given such access shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent
or Merger Sub, be substantially concurrently provided to Parent or Merger Sub
(which requirement may be satisfied by posting such information to the
Electronic Data Room provided that written notice of such posting (which may
be satisfied by email) is provided to or made available to Parent promptly
(and in any event within four (4) hours) after such posting) and (C) the



Company and the Company Board and their respective Representatives shall
withhold such portions of documents or information, or provide pursuant to
customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures, to the extent relating
to any pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in
nature if the exchange of such information (or portions thereof) could
reasonably be likely to be harmful to the operation of the Company in any
material respect), and (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Third Party with respect to the Competing Proposal, if and only if, with
respect to each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii) above, (x) such Third Party has
submitted a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal which did not,
directly or indirectly, arise from any breach of Section 5.6(a) and which the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
and legal advisors, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(z) the Company has provided prior oral and written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub of the determination of the Board.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.6(d) or Section 5.6(e), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement from the time it is required to be first
filed pursuant to Section 5.2(a), (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal, or
resolve to do any foregoing or (iv) fail to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation or fail to recommend against any Competing Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation
statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such Competing Proposal (any of the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 5.6(c) and the proviso set forth in
Section 5.6(g), an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (v) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board shall be permitted to take any of the actions set
forth in Section 5.6(c)(i) and Section 5.6(c)(ii) if (i) an event, fact,
development, circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any
Competing Proposal) that materially improves the business, assets, operations
or prospects of the Company or its subsidiaries and that was not known to the
Company or Company Board as of the date hereof, becomes known to the Company
Board after the date of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event"), (ii) as a
result thereof, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(iii) the Company Board has complied with the requirements set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) of Section 5.6(e) as if such requirements in
connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change relating to a Superior
Proposal related to an Intervening Event.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 5.6(b), at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall only be permitted to
(y) effect an Adverse Recommendation



Change or (z) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(c)(ii)
(provided, that, concurrently with or prior to such termination the Company
pays to Parent the Termination Fee) if and only if, in either case, (i) the
Company Board has received a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal
which did not, directly or indirectly, arise from or in connection with any
breach of Section 5.6(a) or Section 5.6(b) and that, in the good faith
determination of the Company Board, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company
shall not take the actions in either clause (y) or (z) above unless and until
(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"),
at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking such action, that the
Company Board intends to take the action in clause (y) or (z) above, as the
case may be, which Notice of Superior Proposal shall specify the identity of
the party who made such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and shall attach the agreement and all
related documentation providing for such Superior Proposal; (B) after
providing such Notice of Superior Proposal and prior to taking such action in
clause (y) or (z) above, as the case may be, the Company shall negotiate in
good faith with Parent during such three (3) Business Days period (to the
extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board (consistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) not to take such action in
clause (y) or (z) above, as the case may be; and (C) the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing
by Parent and shall have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in
writing by Parent were to be given effect and that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
such Superior Proposal (or material change to the Intervening Event) shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.6(e); provided, however,
that references to the three (3) Business Days period above shall be deemed to
be references to a two (2) Business Day period with respect to any such
amendment to a previous Superior Proposal (or Intervening Event); provided,
further, that in no event shall such new notice period shorten the original
notice period.

(f) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent and Merger Sub of receipt
by the Company of any Competing Proposal or any offer or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal (or any inquiry or
request for negotiating or discussing a Competing Proposal) or any request for
non-public information in connection with any Competing Proposal or offer or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or request
(including the identity of the Third Party and, if applicable, copies of any
documents relating to such Competing Proposal (provided, that any fee letters
may be redacted to the extent required to comply with confidentiality
provisions), and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
on a daily basis) advise Parent and Merger Sub of any material amendments to
any such Competing Proposal or request and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a daily basis of the status and



terms thereof. The Company shall not enter into any agreement with any such
Third Party which would prevent the Company from complying with the provisions
of this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof), directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with respect to a tender
or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders), which "stop, look and listen" communication shall
include an indication that the Company Board has not changed the Company
Recommendation, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), if the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with legal advisors, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosures pursuant to
clause (i) above other than an express rejection of the applicable tender or
exchange offer or an unqualified reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change. Between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, upon the written
request by Parent (A) following any disclosure specified in clauses (i) or
(ii) above or (B) in the event (x) a Competing Proposal has been made publicly
known, (y) an Intervening Event has been made publicly known or (z) any other
event or circumstance has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of the parties to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a
timely basis, the Company Board shall expressly publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days following such request, and
failure to do so shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(h) The approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statute to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be irrevocable and unconditional while this Agreement remains in effect
and no Adverse Recommendation Change in and of itself shall change such
approval for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. To the extent Parent and/or
the Company believes that there has been a breach by a Third Party of any
standstill provision to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce such
standstill provision to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of Section 5.6(b), but subject to applicable
Law, and in furtherance of Section 5.6(a), the Company Board shall not grant
any waiver or release under any standstill agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of the Company. The Company shall enforce, and shall not
release or permit the release of any person from, or amend, waive, terminate
or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination or
modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement or
provision to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliated
Entities is a party or under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has
any rights to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any inquiry, proposal or offer (other than a proposal or
offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) from a Third Party relating to (i)
a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint
venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
assets, revenues or income of the Company; (ii) the acquisition (whether by
merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any
person directly or indirectly of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
consolidated assets, revenues or income of the Company and its subsidiaries
and Affiliated Entities, taken as a whole; (iii) the acquisition in any
manner, directly or indirectly, by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more
of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (iv) any
purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any person beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more
of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whose businesses, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
assets, revenues or income of the Company; or (v) any combination of the
foregoing.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written Competing Proposal
which did not arise from any breach of Section 5.6 (with all references to
"fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to
"fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial and
legal advisors, after taking into account all the terms of the Competing
Proposal (including price, form of consideration, conditionality, likelihood
of financing and regulatory clearance and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal on the terms proposed), are more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
after taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent in
connection with the exercise of its rights in response to such Superior
Proposal pursuant to Section 5.6(e).

(iii) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less restrictive to the
Company's counterparty thereto than the terms set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided, however, that such confidentiality agreement shall not
prohibit the making or amendment of a Competing Proposal or otherwise prohibit
compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of this Section 5.6.

Section 5.7. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time,



whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or
its subsidiaries as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws
or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of the Company's
subsidiaries or in any written agreement set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the "Indemnity Agreements") shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms to the extent provided in the following sentence. From and after the
Effective Time and for a period of at least six (6) years, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses (subject to the
person to whom expenses are advanced providing an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such person is not entitled to indemnification) to, any individual who, on or
prior to the Effective Time, was an officer, director or employee of the
Company or served on behalf of the Company as an officer, director or employee
of any of the Company's subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and the
heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer,
director or employee (each, an "Indemnitee") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law and required by (x) the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or
governing documents of the Company's subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and (y) the Indemnity Agreements, and (ii) not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify for a period of at least six (6) years any such provisions
referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees. The Company has
made available to Parent copies of the Indemnity Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.7(a), during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such Proceeding arises out of or pertains to the
fact that an Indemnitee is or was an officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise or non-profit entity (including any Proceeding arising out of or
pertaining to the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated
hereby), in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such
Proceeding the expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any Indemnitee upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 5.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought under this Section 5.7(b) without the prior
written consent



of each Indemnitee involved in such Proceeding unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such Proceeding and does not
include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee or such
Indemnitee otherwise consents (in such Indemnitee's sole and absolute
discretion) in writing to such settlement, compromise, consent or termination.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance"), in
each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any events occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including any claim related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate annual premium for
such insurance policies for any such year shall not be in excess of the
maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the immediately following
sentence. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall be
no breach of this provision so long as (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6)
years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the
Company's DandO Insurance as of the date hereof with comparable DandO Insurance
that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the
existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual
premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for
such insurance; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, if an Indemnitee is a party to or is otherwise
involved (including as a witness) in any Proceeding (arising before or as of
the Effective Time) on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time with respect to which such Indemnitee was entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses or insurance pursuant to this
Section 5.7, the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect with
respect only to such Proceeding until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.



(d) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors,
heirs or representatives. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.7.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this Section 5.7 shall be in addition
to any rights such person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law
or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8.1 or Section 8.8 to the
contrary, this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.7.

Section 5.8. Notification of Certain Matters; Pending Litigation.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (b) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party's
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby not
to be satisfied (which shall include any material events, discussions,
notices, or changes with respect to any criminal, civil, or administrative
investigation or action involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliated Entities); provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery
of any such notice shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder. The Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent of any Proceeding
brought against the Company or any of its directors relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of any such Proceeding.



(b) Prior to the Closing, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide
Parent (a) on a current basis, updates regarding any material developments or
events related to the matter set forth on Section 5.8(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the "Schedule 5.8(b) Matter ") and (b) copies of all
material submissions made to, or material documents and communications
received from, the relevant counterparties related to the Schedule 5.8(b)
Matter as promptly as practicable following submission or receipt thereof. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to review
in advance all material submissions and communications made to the relevant
counterparties in connection with the Schedule 5.8(b) Matter and any comments
of Parent thereon shall be considered in good faith. In the event of any
substantive oral communications with the relevant counterparties in connection
with the Section 5.8(b) Matter, the Company will provide Parent with an oral
summary of the details of such communications as promptly as practicable (but
no later than three (3) Business Days) following any such communication.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide or
disclose information where such disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of it or its affiliates; provided, that, the Company shall,
to the extent possible, make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which any such restrictions would apply.

Section 5.9. Public Announcements. The initial press release regarding the
transaction contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release by the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub, and thereafter, except pursuant to Section 5.6, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing,
and shall provide each other with reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or otherwise making any public statements (including
conference calls with investors and analysts) with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except pursuant to Section 5.6,

Parent shall provide or cause its subsidiaries or affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide (i) base salary, wages and commission
opportunities and annual bonus opportunity to each individual who is an
employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee" and collectively, the "Company
Employees" ) at a rate that is no less favorable than the rate of base salary,
wages or commission and annual bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) Company Employees, collectively, other employee
benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other
employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension benefits and retiree

such Company Employees immediately



prior to the Effective Time; provided, that any net reduction in the aggregate
other employee benefits to a Company Employee may be compensated, in whole or
in part, by an increase in base salary, wages and commission opportunities and
annual bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, with respect to such Company
Employee.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), from and after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall or cause its subsidiaries or affiliates ,
including the Surviving Corporation, to assume, honor and continue all of the
Company Benefit Plans that are employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including
any change in control or severance agreement between the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company and any Company Employee), in each case, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement or to the extent amended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement as in effect prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to
any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event).

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of
level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs

benefit pension arrangements), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company, the Company subsidiaries and
their respective affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements or waiting periods of such New Plan
to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan
year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

Company, Inc. Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") as of the date hereof will
continue to be eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the 2015 fiscal year
determined in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Plan as in effect on
the date of this Agreement; provided, that Company performance in respect of
calculations made under the Incentive Plan shall be calculated without taking
into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that
would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, as reasonably determined by
Parent, and Parent hereby agrees (a) to cause the individual target and
maximum bonus opportunities to remain at current levels in respect of the 2015
fiscal year and (b) to make any adjustments to the 2015 fiscal year
performance goals under the Incentive Plan that are reasonably necessary to
reflect the acquisition of the Company by Parent in a manner that does not
make it more difficult for such performance goals to be achieved.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
(i) be treated as an amendment or modification of any Company Benefit Plan,

therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third

taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall, immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole

action by written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance
with applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger

ARTICLE VII 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 7.1. Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
obtained (except as otherwise expressly provided), as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2016
(the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party if such party has breached in any material respect its obligations under
this Agreement in a manner that shall have been the principal cause of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such date;

(ii) (A) a Law shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger on the terms contemplated hereby or (B) any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Order was primarily due to the failure of such party, and in the case of
Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement; or



(iii) the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a
duly held Stockholders' Meeting or at any adjournment, continuation, recess or
postponement thereof at which this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby have been voted upon;

(c) by the Company if:

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would result in a failure of
a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 and (y) cannot be cured on
or before the Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, prior to the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days of
receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure and (B) the
Termination Date; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if the Company
is in material breach of any representation, warranty covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that would cause a condition set forth in Section
6.1 or Section 6.2 not to be satisfied; or

(ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, provided that the
Company has not breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of
its obligations under Section 5.6, (x) the Company Board has determined and
authorized the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by and in accordance
with the terms of Section 5.6(e), and (y) concurrently with such termination,
(A) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee;

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been
satisfied or, if permitted by applicable Law, waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Merger Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Merger
Closing), the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that the
Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger and Parent and
Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger within three (3) Business Days
following the date the Merger Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section
1.2; provided, that the Company stood ready, willing and able to consummate
the Merger during such three (3) Business Day period; or

(d) by Parent if:

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would result in a failure of
a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 and (y) cannot be cured on
or before the Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company
prior to



the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days of receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach or failure and (B) the Termination Date; provided,
however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i) if the Parent is in material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would cause a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 not to be
satisfied; or

(ii) the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto (or any of their respective Representatives, the Parent Related
Parties, the Lender Related Parties or the Company Related Parties), and all
rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; provided, however,
that the Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent set forth therein), the last
sentence of Section 5.4(a), the expense reimbursement provisions of Section
5.4(c), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Section 7.5, the first
sentence of Section 7.6 and Article VIII shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages
resulting from Willful Breach prior to such termination by any party hereto of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein. In
no event shall the Company seek to obtain monetary damages from any of Parent,
its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, "Parent Related
Parties ") or any Lender Related Party (as defined in Section 8.6) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to (and subject to the conditions of) this
Agreement. In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub seek to obtain monetary
damages from any Company Related Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than the Company pursuant to (and subject
to the conditions of) this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Willful Breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act
taken by the breaching party, or the failure by the breaching party to take an
act it is required to take under this Agreement, with actual knowledge that
the taking of, or the failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.3. Termination Fee.

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section
7.1(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), and (y) (A) the
Company receives or has received a Competing Proposal from a Third Party after
the date hereof which Competing Proposal is publicly disclosed or any Third



Party shall have publicly announced an intention to make a Competing Proposal
or a Competing Proposal shall have otherwise become known to the Company or
the Company Board, and in each case such Competing Proposal was not publicly
withdrawn at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date, in
respect of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii),
respectively, or at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of
termination of the Agreement in respect of a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i) and (B) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company or its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, a transaction in
connection with a Competing Proposal (regardless of whether such Competing
Proposal is the same one referred to in clause (A) above), then the Company
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or such person who may be
designated by Parent) an amount equal to $47,000,000 (the "Termination Fee")
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the earlier to occur of
the entry into a definitive agreement concerning a Competing Proposal or the
date of the consummation of a transaction arising from such Competing
Proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(i), the
references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)" and a Competing
Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any Third
Party if, within 12 months of the relevant termination, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or Affiliated Entities shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal or shall have consummated a
Competing Proposal made by or on behalf of such Third Party or any of its
Affiliates; or

(ii) the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii), or by Parent or Company pursuant to any other provision of
Section 7.1 at any time after Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to Parent (or such person who may be designated by Parent) the
Termination Fee, if the termination was by the Parent, as promptly as
practicable and not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such
termination or, if the termination was by the Company, concurrently with such
termination.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 7.2 and Section 8.10, if Parent has the right to receive
payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i)
or Section 7.3(a)(ii), the payment of the Termination Fee and other amounts
payable pursuant to Section 7.3(d) shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates and
Representatives against the Company, its subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for all



losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise giving rise to or associated with such
termination, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(except that the Company shall also be obligated to Parent and Merger Sub
under Section 7.3(d)); provided, that, in circumstances in which the
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) or Section
7.3(a)(ii), notwithstanding payment of the Termination Fee by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) or Section 7.3(a)(ii), Parent shall have the
right to also seek to recover monetary damages from the Company solely in the
event of a Willful Breach by the Company of the covenants and agreements set
forth in Section 5.6.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Parent or its
affiliates, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii)
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount
set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent
(5%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 7.4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after the Requisite Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law; provided, further that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, Section 7.2, this Section 7.4,
Section 8.8, Section 8.9, Section 8.11 and Section 8.13 (and any related
definitions to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
definitions would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to the Lender Related Parties without the prior written
consent of such Lender Related Parties (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

Section 7.5. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and



warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.4, waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 7.6. Expenses; Transfer Taxes. Unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, but subject to Section 2.2(c), either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid, all documentary, sales, use, stock
transfer, real property transfer, other transfer, real property gains,
registration, stamp, recording and similar Taxes (in no event including Taxes
of the stockholders computed in whole or in part on the basis of income),
fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines,
additions to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, any backup withholding or similar Taxes,
which shall be subject to Section 2.8), and shall file all Tax Returns related
thereto that are required to be filed by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

of their respective affiliates) shall have the right, without the prior
written consent of the Company, to assign all or any portion of its rights,

and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, and the Parent Disclosure Letter,
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and their affiliates,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
execution of this Agreement by the Company shall constitute written consent by
the Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to all actions by
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement. Furthermore, the Company agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement
is hereby amended to permit the inclusion of all existing or prospective
financing sources in the term "Representative" as such term is defined

Parent's or Merger Sub's Willful Breach of this Agreement, which right is
hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, (d) the provisions of
Section 7.2 with respect to the Parent



Related Parties and (e) that the Lender Related Parties shall be express third
party beneficiaries with respect to Section 7.2, Section 7.4, this Section
8.8, Section 8.9, Section 8.11 and Section 8.13, Parent and the Company hereby
agree that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.5 without
notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.9. Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (collectively, an "Action") (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware; without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 8.10. Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, subject to Section 7.3(c) and Section 8.10(b),
the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that, subject to Section
8.10(b), it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. The provisions of Section 8.10(b) shall not affect the right of
the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief described in this Section 8.10(a), to enforce
any of its rights under this Agreement (including under Section 5.4) other
than with respect to any and/or all of the Consummation Events.

(b) Notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief described in
Section 8.10(a), no such



right may be enforced to cause the Merger to be consummated or the Merger
Consideration to be paid (whether under this Agreement or otherwise) (each, a
"Consummation Event") unless with respect to the Merger and the payment of the
Merger Consideration, all the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section
6.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Merger Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the
Merger Closing) have been satisfied or waived.

(c) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Subject to Section
8.10(b), each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or
the Company, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub, or the Company, as applicable, under this Agreement. The parties hereto
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
8.10, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including the
right to seek and recover damages for a Willful Breach under Section 7.2) in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.10 are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 8.10 shall require any
party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.10
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article VII
(and pursuing damages for a Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub under
Section 7.2 after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal
proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.10 or anything set forth in this Section
8.10 restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article VII (other than as set forth in Section
8.10(c)) or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement (including the
right to seek and recover damages for a Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub
under Section 7.2), that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 8.11. Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, the United
States District Court for the State of Delaware and any appellate court with
jurisdiction to hear appeals from such courts (as applicable, the "Chosen
Court"), for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in the
Chosen Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees (A) that any Action (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) involving any Lender Related Party arising out of or relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Financing, the Debt



Commitment Letter or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (and appellate
courts thereof) and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (B)
not to bring or permit any of their affiliates to bring or support anyone else
in bringing any such Action in any other court, (C) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their
respective addresses shall be effective service of process against them for
any such Action brought in any such court, (D) to waive and hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such court
and (E) that any such Action (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct
or otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this Section 8.11 shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (b) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Court in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court and
(d) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Chosen
Court.

Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
