Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates representing Shares or Company Preferred Shares (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;) or of
Company OP Units (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and, (ii)&nbsp;if applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the consideration (and any unpaid distributions and dividends)
contemplated by <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U> and this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U>, including cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares. Upon (i)&nbsp;surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, if applicable, and (ii)&nbsp;delivery by such a holder of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, such
holder, if a holder of a Certificate representing Shares or of Company OP Units, shall be entitled
to receive promptly in exchange therefor (x)&nbsp;a certificate representing that number of whole Parent
Shares, (y)&nbsp;a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and (z)
unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to the Parent Shares as provided for in <U>Section
2.3(c)</U>, if any, that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U> or in respect of such Company OP
Units and, if a holder of a Certificate representing Company Preferred Shares, shall be entitled to
receive promptly in exchange therefor the Preferred Merger Consideration in cash with respect to
each Company Preferred Share represented by such Certificate, in all such cases after giving effect
to any required withholding Tax. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable to
holders of Shares, Company OP Units or Company Preferred Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares, Company OP Units or Company Preferred Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company or Company OP, a certificate representing the proper number of
Parent Shares, together with a check for the cash to be paid pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U>,
or the Preferred Merger Consideration, may be issued to such a transferee if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or such Certificate or Company OP Units shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the transferee shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Company OP Units or establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

the Merger Effective Time on Parent Shares shall be paid with respect to any Shares represented by
a Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein or a Person
claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed has complied with the provisions of
<U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U>. Promptly following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to
the holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i)&nbsp;at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Merger Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
Parent Shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required

Taxes which may be required thereon. Parent will, no later than the applicable dividend or

of such cash adjustment shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying such holder&#146;s

transfer books of the Surviving Partnership of the Company OP Units that were outstanding
immediately prior to the OP Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Termination of Exchange Funds</U>. Any portion of the Exchange Fund or Preferred
Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Shares) which
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company OP Units, as
applicable, for six months after the Merger Effective Time may be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company OP Units who have not theretofore
complied with this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U> and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal
mailed to such holders after the Merger Effective Time or the OP Merger Effective Time shall
thereafter look only to Parent or its agent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) for payment of their Parent Shares or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as

detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a
