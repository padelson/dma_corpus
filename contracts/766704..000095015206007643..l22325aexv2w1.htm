Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, if applicable, and (ii) delivery by such a holder of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, such holder, if a holder of a Certificate representing Shares or of Company OP Units, shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole Parent Shares, (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and (z) unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to the Parent Shares as provided for in _Section 2.3(c)_ , if any, that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ or in respect of such Company OP Units and, if a holder of a Certificate representing Company Preferred Shares, shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the Preferred Merger Consideration in cash with respect to each Company Preferred Share represented by such Certificate, in all such cases after giving effect to any required withholding Tax.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares, Company OP Units or Company Preferred Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or Company OP, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Shares, together with a check for the cash to be paid pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, or the Preferred Merger Consideration, may be issued to such a transferee if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or such Certificate or Company OP Units shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the transferee shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Company OP Units or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (c) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with a record date after the Merger Effective Time on Parent Shares shall be paid with respect to any Shares represented by a Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein or a Person claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed has complied with the provisions of  _Section 2.5_. Promptly following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required 

  ##### 

  

    

thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Merger Effective Time, but prior to such surrender or
compliance and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or compliance
payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares, less the amount of any
withholding Taxes which may be required thereon. Parent will, no later than
the applicable dividend or distribution payment dates, set aside and provide
the Exchange Agent with the cash necessary to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section 2.3(c)_, which shall be held for such purpose and for the
sole benefit of such holders of Parent Shares. 

   

 (d) _No Fractional Securities_. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional Parent Shares, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in respect of any fractional Parent Shares that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying such holders fractional Parent Share that would otherwise be issuable by the closing price per share of Parent Shares on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on the Closing Date as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition) (or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source). 

   

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Parent Shares issued or cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Company OP Units in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares or Company Preferred Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates or Company OP Units. At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the Shares or Company Preferred Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. At the OP Merger Effective Time, the partnership interest transfer books of Company OP shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the partnership interest transfer books of the Surviving Partnership of the Company OP Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the OP Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

   

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Funds_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund or Preferred Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any Parent Shares) which remains undistributed to the holders of Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company OP Units, as applicable, for six months after the Merger Effective Time may be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares, Company Preferred Shares or Company OP Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Merger Effective Time or the OP Merger Effective Time shall thereafter look only to Parent or its agent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their Parent Shares or the Preferred Merger Consideration, as applicable, cash and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Shares deliverable in respect of each Share or Company OP Unit such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, OP Merger Sub, the Company, Company OP or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 Section 2.4. _Adjustment of Exchange Ratio_. In the event that Parent changes or establishes a record date for changing the number of Parent Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent Shares and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Times, the Exchange Ratio applicable to the Mergers and any other calculations based on or relating to Parent Shares shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, reclassification, combination or similar transaction. 

   

 Section 2.5. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent Shares, Preferred Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

 (a) If at any time after the Merger Effective Time the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, permits, licenses or assets of either of the Constituent Entities, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Entity and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Entities, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent Entity, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Entitys right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent Entity and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 (e) None of the Employee Plans is a multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (" _Multiemployer Plan_ "). None of the Group Members or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is or has ever been treated as a single employer with any Group Member under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has incurred any liability due to a complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan or due to the termination or reorganization of a Multiemployer Plan, except for any such liability which has been satisfied in full, and no events have occurred and no circumstances exist that would be expected to result in any such Liability to any Group Member or ERISA Affiliate.

Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parents Board (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for Parents auditors and audit committee of Parents Board any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not   #####

accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no material
concerns from Parent employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters, have been received by the Parent. Parent has made available to
Company a summary of all complaints or concerns relating to other
matters made since the Applicable Date through Parents whistleblower hot
line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of law. No attorney representing Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,
whether or not employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, has
reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Parent or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to Parents chief legal officer, audit committee (or
other committee designated for the purpose) of the Board or the Board
pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act or any Parent policy contemplating such reporting.

such notice the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request; and (B) keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of the
status and material terms of (including all material changes to the status or
material terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.6(a)_, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board shall not be prohibited from furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Board after the date hereof which was not invited, initiated, solicited or encouraged, directly or indirectly, by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative on or after the date hereof if, and only to the extent that, (i) the Board concludes in good faith, based upon advice of its outside legal counsel, that such action is required to discharge the Boards duties to the Company and its shareholders under Entity Law, (ii) a majority of the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company complies with all of its obligations under this Agreement, (iv) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions with such Person, and (v) the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person the material terms of which are (without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects no less favorable to the Company, and no less restrictive to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement but which confidentiality agreement permits disclosure to Parent of the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (c) If, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board or any committee thereof intends: (i) to publicly approve or recommend, or propose to publicly approve or recommend, any Superior Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) to cause the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to any Superior Acquisition Proposal (other than any confidentiality agreement as contemplated by _Section 6.6(b)_) (a " _Competing Agreement_ "), then at least five Business Days prior to taking such action: (A) the Company shall provide Parent with written notice advising Parent that the Board has received a Superior Acquisition Proposal that it intends to accept, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Acquisition Proposal, identifying the Person or Persons making such Superior Acquisition Proposal and, if in writing, delivering to Parent the most recent draft of such definitive Competing Agreement and a summary of the material terms of any agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party that is integrated therewith, in its possession, and (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Parent for up to five (5) Business Days to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the " _Adjusted Terms_ "). If following the completion of such five (5) Business Day period the Board, in its sole judgment, has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that the Adjusted Terms are not at least as favorable to the Company shareholders as the Superior Acquisition Proposal (taking into account all financial and strategic considerations and 

     ##### 

 

  

other relevant factors, including relevant legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposals, and the conditions, prospects and time
required for completion of such proposal), then the Board or any committee

recommend, such Superior Acquisition Proposal; (ii) make an
Adverse Recommendation or (iii) cause the Company to enter into a Competing
Agreement with respect to such Superior Acquisition Proposal.

    ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Company will consult with and provide Parent the opportunity to review and comment upon all federal income Tax Returns required to be filed after the date hereof by the Company and Company OP with respect to Taxes, and shall not file any such federal income Tax Returns without the prior review and comment of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may file a Tax Return prior to receipt of comments from Parent if necessary to ensure such Tax Return is timely filed. From the date hereof until the Merger Effective Time, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will duly and timely file all Tax Returns and other documents required by it to be filed with federal, state and local Tax authorities, subject to extensions permitted by law and properly granted by the appropriate authority; _provided_ that such extensions do not adversely affect the Companys status as a REIT under the Code, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company notifies Parent that it or any of its Company Subsidiaries is availing itself of any federal or state extensions.

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall declare a dividend to their respective shareholders, the record date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Merger Effective Time. The per share dividend amount payable by each party shall be an amount equal to such partys most recent quarterly dividend rate, multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date through and 

    ##### 

  

 

including the day prior to the day on which the Merger Effective Time occurs,
and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which
such dividend is declared.

After the Merger Effective Time, all Persons employed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Times (" _Affected Employees_ ") shall continue to participate in the Employee Plans that are "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other similarly situated employees of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary in any corresponding Parent Plans that are "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA). With respect to each such Parent Plan, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as applicable) shall be included for all purposes, including eligibility to participate and vesting (if applicable), but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any Parent Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

Nothing contained in this _Section 8.1_ shall be deemed to obligate Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to continue the employment or benefits with respect to any Person employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Merger Effective Time or for any period of time thereafter. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent at any time hereafter, or the ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Merger Effective Time to amend or terminate any Employee Plan. 

   

 Section 8.2. _Indemnification of Company Officers and Trustees_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall provide exculpation and indemnification for each person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or trustee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") which is the same as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by the Company (including advancement of expenses, if so provided) in the Company Organizational Documents, as in effect at the close of business on the date hereof, which exculpation and indemnification shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were, at any time prior to the Effective Times, directors, trustees, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided, that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on or prior to the Effective Times, including, without limitation, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Companys existing directors and executive officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively the " _Tail Insurance_ "), for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years 

    ##### 

  

 

from and after the Effective Times from an insurance company or companies with
the same or better credit rating from AM Best Company as the Companys
current insurance companies on its existing directors, officers and
trustees insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies, with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as such existing policies, with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty, or any matter claimed against a director, trustee or officer of the
Company solely by reason of their serving in such capacity, that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Times (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving
Entity for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Times, the Surviving Entity shall obtain such policies and, pending
the effectiveness of such policies, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Times the Tail
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date hereof, or the Surviving Entity shall, use reasonable best efforts
to purchase comparable Tail Insurance for such six-year period with benefits
and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend for such policies
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance; and,  _provided_ _further_ that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Entity shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Times in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives to which this _Section 8.2_ applies, without the consent of such Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives. The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Company. Parent agrees to pay all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party or his or her heirs or his or her personal representatives in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other obligations of Parent under this _Section 8.2_. The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ shall survive the Merger and are in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled. 

   

 (d) If either the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.2_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_.

     ##### 

  

    

constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to the
Company, and (B) in the event the Company receives a letter from outside
counsel (the " _Company Expense Reimbursement Tax Opinion_ ") indicating that
the Companys receipt of the Company Expense Reimbursement would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that the receipt by the Company of the
excess of the Company Expense Reimbursement over the amount payable under
clause (A) following the receipt of such opinion would not be deemed
constructively received prior thereto, the Company Expense Reimbursement less
