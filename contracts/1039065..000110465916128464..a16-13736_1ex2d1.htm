**

 

 **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES**

 



 

2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Company and Buyer-Owned Stock_. As of the Effective Time,
(i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a Subsidiary of the
Company, the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Buyer (other than the Transitory
Subsidiary) shall be converted into and become validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (except that
that number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by any such Subsidiary
may be adjusted following the Merger to maintain relative ownership
percentages).

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares referred to in Section
2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a) below)) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without
interest. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares referred to in Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares, if
any) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the time of the mailing of the proxy statement to
be sent to the shareholders of the Company related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"), Buyer shall (i) designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), and (ii) enter into a paying agent
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with
such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment in accordance with this
Article II of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, for payment through the Paying Agent in
accordance with this Section 2.2, immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(b) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to payment thereof (the "Payment Fund"). The Company shall cooperate
with the Buyer to facilitate an orderly transfer of funds. The Buyer shall
instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration subject to
and in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall instruct the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled
to payment of the Merger Consideration (each, a "Certificate") (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration (less any required Tax
withholdings), without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of
this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately and
automatically be cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer

 



      
 

 



 

records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent provided that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered has been properly endorsed, with signature
guaranteed, or is otherwise in proper form for transfer and is accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have provided evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of uncertificated shares that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock ("Uncertificated Shares") shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated
Shares shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share, be promptly paid in
exchange therefor a cash amount (less any required Tax withholdings) in
immediately available funds equal to (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Uncertificated Shares multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration, without interest, and such Uncertificated Shares shall
forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Uncertificated Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Uncertificated Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Person" means an individual, corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, association, trust, unincorporated organization, or other entity
or group (as defined in the Exchange Act).

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, and from and after
the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer or otherwise
on the instruction of the Buyer, and any holder of Company Common Stock who
has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation and the Buyer (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws, the property of the
Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Buyer. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of the
Buyer. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Payment Agent hereunder, the Buyer shall promptly deposit cash
into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company
Restricted Shares, as applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, the Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to such holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Buyer and the Paying Agent, and if reasonably required by
the Buyer or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Buyer or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
or other documentation reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Paying Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

2.3. _Company Stock Plans and Cash Awards_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company
Stock Options") granted under the American Science and Engineering, Inc. 2005
Equity and Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time) or the American
Science and Engineering, Inc. 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan (as amended from
time to time) (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans")

 



      
 

 



 

shall vest in full and automatically be canceled and converted into the right
to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, from the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company
Stock Option, less such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable tax laws. In the event that the exercise price of
any Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled
and have no further force or effect, without any consideration being payable
in respect thereof or in exchange for such cancellation, and all rights with
respect to such Company Stock Option shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is subject to
repurchase by the Company pursuant to a restricted stock agreement with the
Company ("Company Restricted Shares") that is then outstanding and unvested
shall automatically become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse, and each such Company Restricted Share shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, less such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable tax laws.

 



 

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of
restricted stock units granted under any Company Stock Plan ("Company RSUs")
that is then outstanding and unvested shall be assumed by the Buyer and shall
be converted into a new award of restricted stock units of the Buyer ("Assumed
RSUs") covering a number of shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per
share, of the Buyer ("Buyer Common Stock") equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company
RSU award multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Merger
Consideration by (y) the average closing sales price for a share of Buyer
Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the ten (10) consecutive
trading days ending with, and including, the trading day that is two (2)
trading days prior to the date of the Closing Date. Subject to the following
sentence, each Assumed RSU shall otherwise continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions (including the vesting arrangements and
other terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and
the Company RSU award agreement thereunder) as are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the Buyer shall have any and all amendment
and administrative authority with respect to such Assumed RSUs (subject, in
the case of any amendment, to the required consent of the affected holder of
such Assumed RSU). For purposes of this Section 2.3(c), with respect to any
Company RSUs granted pursuant to a form of American Science and Engineering,
Inc. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Agreement for FY 2016-2018
Performance Period agreement, any performance-based vesting conditions (i.e.,
vesting conditions other than those based solely on the continued service of
the holder of the Company RSU) applicable to such Company RSUs shall be deemed
to have been satisfied based on actual performance if the applicable
performance period has concluded and the applicable performance result can be
calculated, or, if the applicable performance period has not concluded or the
applicable performance results cannot be calculated, then based on "target-
level" performance.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each cash award
granted pursuant to a form American Science and Engineering, Inc. FY2014 Long
Term Incentives Cash Award Agreement or form American Science and Engineering,
Inc. FY2015 Long Term Incentives Cash Award Agreement ("Restricted Cash") that
is then outstanding and unvested shall be assumed by the Buyer ("Assumed Cash
Awards"). Each Assumed Cash Award shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions (including the vesting arrangements and other
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement) as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, make the
payments contemplated by the foregoing Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs or Restricted Cash a letter describing
the treatment of, and, if applicable, payment for such equity or cash awards
pursuant to this Section 2.3 and, if applicable, providing instructions for
use in obtaining payment therefor. Additionally, prior to the Effective Time,
the Company Board and/or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt
resolutions providing for the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and Restricted Cash as contemplated by this
Section 2.3.

 



 

(g) The Buyer and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in another manner to take into
account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

 



 

2.4. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a shareholder who has not voted in favor of this
Agreement or the Merger or consented thereto in writing, and has perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the MBCA (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting
Shares" unless and until such time as such holder effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the MBCA) shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to the payment
provided to a holder of Dissenting Shares by Section 13.02 of the MBCA.

 



 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through
withdrawal or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares will no longer be Dissenting Shares
and, if the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or other loss of status is
later than the Effective Time, will be treated as if the shareholder had, as
of the Effective Time, been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt written notice of any notice
of intent to demand or demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA that relate to such demand; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment
or settlement offer or approve any withdrawal of any such demand prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless
the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment, settlement
offer or withdrawal of any such demand.

2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any
disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" or "forward-looking statements"
Section or other forward-looking statements to the extent such statements are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature, and provided that nothing
disclosed in such Company SEC Reports shall be deemed to be a qualification or
modification to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.4,
3.21, 3.22 or 3.23) or (b) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered
by the Company to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary and dated as of the
date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule").

 



 

3.1. _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do
business and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to the Buyer complete and accurate copies of the Articles
of Organization and By-laws, with all amendments thereto through the date
hereof, of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company
Material Adverse Effect" means any event, change, circumstance, condition,
effect, development or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate,
is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that "Company Material Adverse Effect"
shall not include the effect of any event, change, circumstance, condition,
effect, development or state of facts to the extent resulting from, arising
out of or attributable to: (i) general economic or political conditions (or
changes in such conditions) in the United States or any other country or
region in the world; (ii) conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the
securities markets, credit markets, currency markets or other financial
markets in the United States or any other country or region in the world;
(iii) conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the industries in which
the Company and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries conduct business; (iv) acts of war, sabotage or terrorism
(including any escalation or general worsening of any such acts of war,
sabotage or terrorism) in the United States or any other country or region in
the world; (v) earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods,
mudslides, wild fires or other natural disasters, weather conditions and other
force majeure events in the United States or any other country or region in
the world; (vi) the announcement of this Agreement or the pendency or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that the
exceptions in this clause (vi) shall not apply to the representations and
warranties made in Sections 3.4, 3.10(b) or 3.15(g)); (vii) the taking of any
action specifically required or contemplated by this Agreement; (viii) changes
in law or GAAP (or the interpretations thereof); (ix) any fees or expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(x) changes in the Companys stock price or the trading volume of the
Companys stock, or any failure by the Company to meet any public estimates or
expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial performance
or results of operations for any period, or any failure by the Company to meet
any internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other
financial performance or results of operations (it being understood that, in
each case, the facts giving rise or contributing to or the underlying cause of
such changes or failures may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account
in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a
Company Material Adverse Effect, unless such changes or failures would
otherwise be excepted from this definition); or (xi) any legal proceedings
made or brought by any of the current or former shareholders of the Company
(on their behalf or on behalf of the Company) against the Company, including
legal proceedings arising out of the Merger or in connection with any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (v) and (viii), to the extent such event,
change, circumstance, condition, effect, development or state of facts
disproportionately adversely affects in a material respect the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies that conduct
business in the countries and regions in the world and in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business (in which case, such
adverse effects shall be taken into account when determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may or would occur solely to the
extent they are disproportionate in a material respect).

 



 

3.2. _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement consists of 20,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 100,000

Property necessary to conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries

the

Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Intellectual Property" means
(i) patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, copyrights,
designs and trade secrets, (ii) applications for and registrations of such
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, copyrights and

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the

Property, or (ii) any license, sublicense or other agreement as to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized to use or has any rights in
any third party Intellectual Property that is material to the business of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, excluding software licensed
under an open source license and generally commercially available, off-the-
shelf software programs licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on
standard terms, in object code form, without the right to modify such software
programs, with annual royalties or other fees not exceeding $100,000 (the
"Third Party IP Agreements"). For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Company Intellectual Property" means any Intellectual Property owned or
purported to be owned in whole or in part by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Companys Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Section 3.10(b)(i) of

held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and which are material to the

subsisting and have not expired or been cancelled. To the Companys Knowledge,
no third party is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the Company
Intellectual Property, except for infringements, violations or
misappropriations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

 



 

(d) To the Companys Knowledge, the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe, violate or
constitute a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of any third party,
except for such infringements, violations and misappropriations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the conduct of the business of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and as currently conducted. Since April 1, 2013,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written claim
or notice alleging any infringement, violation or misappropriation of
Intellectual Property (including any third-party claims for indemnification).

 



       
 

 



 

(e) The Company and the Companys Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures
to protect, maintain and safeguard their rights in all trade secrets,
confidential and proprietary information included in the Company Intellectual
Property that are material to the conduct of the business of the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and as currently conducted. To
the Companys Knowledge, no Company Intellectual Property is in jeopardy of
lapsing or being abandoned through failure to act of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) take all reasonable actions to
protect the integrity, security and operation of the software and systems used

of the same, other than those that have been satisfactorily resolved without
material liability or expense; (ii) require and have required all Persons who
create or invent, or who have created or invented, material proprietary
Intellectual Property to assign in writing their rights in same to the
Company; (iii) do not use any software that uses, incorporates or is derived
from or based upon any software governed by an "open source" or similar
license that requires the licensing or availability of source code if such
software is licensed, distributed, conveyed or made available to third
parties; and (iv) are the only Persons who have possession or the current or
contingent right to possess or access their material proprietary source code.
To the Companys Knowledge, there has been no unauthorized access to or theft
of the Company IT Systems or material unauthorized disclosure or material loss
of any data stored by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries.

adversely affect the exempt status of any such trust.

this Agreement. No amount paid or payable by the Company or any of its

Knowledge, is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(k) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as required by applicable law, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide (whether under an Employee Benefit
Plan or otherwise) retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any
Person.

that provide health, life or disability insurance are fully insured by bona
fide third-party insurers.

 



 

(m) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is governed by the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or provides compensation or benefits
to any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Benefit
Plan any required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations
of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to
give effect to such Foreign Benefit Plan, (iv) there are no pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity,
proceedings or claims (except for claims for benefits in the ordinary course)
against such Foreign Plan, and (v) neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
either alone or in combination with another event (whether contingent or
otherwise) will create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to
such Foreign Benefit Plan. No Foreign Benefit Plan has any unfunded or
underfunded liabilities not accurately accrued in accordance with GAAP, where
required to be so accrued.

Subsidiaries have been in material compliance with, have not been in material
violation of and have not received any notice alleging any material violation

Change (A) in response to a Company Intervening Event or (B) following receipt
of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement
that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.1 that the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, is a Superior Proposal, in each case
of clauses (A) and (B) if, and only if, prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change, (xx) the Company Board has determined in good faith,

under applicable Law and (yy) the Company complies with Section 6.1(c), or (y)
following receipt of a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date

cause or permit the

 



      
 

 



 

Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) for the purpose
of entering into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement (an "Alternative Definitive Acquisition
Agreement") with respect to such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, (xx)
prior to such termination, the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys shareholders
under applicable Law, (yy) prior to such termination, the Company complies
with Section 6.1(c), and (zz) concurrently with such termination, (1) the

and conditions of this Agreement and (C) following the end of such four (4)
Business Day period, the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Merger set
forth in a written and binding offer of the Buyer, shall re-determine in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that
(x) such Company Intervening Event continues to necessitate a Company Board
Recommendation Change, even if the modifications offered by the Buyer were to
be given effect and (y) failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys shareholders under applicable
Law, or (ii) under clause (x)(B) or clause (y) in the second sentence of

Days prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in connection with
the applicable Acquisition Proposal, or any material amendment to the
financial terms or any other material terms of the applicable Acquisition
Proposal, shall require a new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day
period) advising the Buyer that it intends to take such action, and attaching
a complete copy of the Acquisition Proposal (any such notice described in
either of clauses (i)(A) or (ii)(A) of this Section 6.1(c), a "Recommendation
Change Notice") (it being understood that a Recommendation Change Notice shall
not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement), (B) the Company shall, during such four (4) Business Day period
(or subsequent three (3) Business Day period), make its Representatives

continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) failure to effect such
Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)

Acquisition Proposal or the material events, facts, circumstances,

cease and terminate immediately all activities, discussions, communications
and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding
any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) take such action as is necessary to enforce any
confidentiality provisions or provisions of similar effect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary and (iii) not terminate, waive, amend,
release or modify any provision of any standstill agreement (including any
standstill provision contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) to
which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party, unless,

good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law. The Company shall promptly after the date
of this Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal with or for the
benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information, documents and materials relating to an Acquisition Proposal or to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or its businesses, operations or affairs

other than by the Buyer or a controlled Affiliate of the Buyer following the

amended or modified) which the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable
to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors), taking into account all the terms,
conditions and other aspects relating to such proposal (including the
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including

of this Agreement; which event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
becomes known to or by the Company Board prior to obtaining the Required
Company Shareholder Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following
will constitute a Company Intervening Event: (i) any action taken by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to and in compliance with the
affirmative covenants set forth in Section 5.1, (ii) any change in the market
price or trading volume of the Companys stock (it being understood that the
facts giving rise or contributing to such change may be deemed to constitute,
or be taken into account in determining whether there is a Company Intervening
Event), (iii) the failure of the Company to meet internal or analysts
estimates, guidance, projections or forecasts of the results of operations of
the Company (it being understood that the facts giving rise or contributing to
such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there is a Company Intervening Event), (iv) the receipt,
existence of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry relating
thereto or the

 



      
 

 



 

consequences thereof, and (v) any event, change, circumstance, effect,

applicable requirements of Law and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to respond, with the
assistance of, and after consultation with, the Buyer, to the extent provided

Recommendation Change Notice, whenever any event occurs which is required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any
information relating to the Company, the Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or the Buyer

Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of
such occurrence or discovery and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials, and/or mailing to shareholders of the
Company to the extent required by applicable Law, such appropriate amendment

Proxy Statement, each of the Company, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall (x) provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements to
the foregoing documents and (y) consider in

6.1, (a) the Company Board shall recommend approval of the Company Voting
Proposal by the shareholders of the Company and include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and (b) the Company Board shall not effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change. Subject to Section 6.1, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of
the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the shareholders of
the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market or the
MBCA to obtain such approvals. The Company shall keep the Buyer updated with
respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by the Buyer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting after consultation with
the Buyer, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys shareholders
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Meeting or, if as
of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled

 



      
 

 



 

(as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting. The Company agrees
that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section
8.1, its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not be affected by the
making of any Company Board Recommendation Change by the Company Board or the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event.

 



 

6.6. _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.6(b), the
Company and the Buyer shall each use its best efforts to:

 



 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 



 

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any
other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or
the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the
Effective Time, any fee, penalties or other consideration to any third party
to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger;

 



 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal
or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, the Antitrust Laws listed on
Schedule 6.6 and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any
other applicable law; and

 



 

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

 



 

The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings and submissions, including providing copies of
all such filings and submissions to the non-filing party and its advisors
prior to filing or submitting and, if requested, accepting reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company
and the Buyer shall use their respective best efforts to furnish to each other
all information required for any filing or other submission to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law (including all
information required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Buyer and the Company agree that nothing contained in this Section 6.6(a)
shall modify or affect their respective rights and responsibilities under
Section 6.6(b).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Buyers obligations
under Section 6.6(c), the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective best
efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for Closing
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to avoid any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent (a "Restrictive Order")), or court, administrative, or other filing
by any party seeking to obtain such Restrictive Order, that restricts,
materially delays, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the
other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Law, it being understood and agreed that, while the Buyer will
consider the views of the Company, the Buyer will hold the final decision-
making authority with respect to addressing any issue under any Antitrust Law.
To the extent permitted by law or Governmental Entities reviewing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties will provide each
other the opportunity to participate in meetings and other substantive
conversations with any such Governmental Entities.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.6, in exercising its best efforts to obtain all
required Regulatory Approvals, the Buyer shall take any and all steps
necessary in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Effective Time beyond the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating,
offering to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Buyer or,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offering to take or offer to commit to
take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted,
taking or committing to take such action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may expressly condition
any such sale, holding separate, or other disposal, and any agreement to take
any such action or to conduct its business in any manner, upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no
requirement for a waiver, consent, approval or termination of applicable
waiting periods of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental
Entity, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter relating
to any antitrust or competition law or regulation, would preclude consummation
of the Merger by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require the Buyer to sell,
divest or dispose of assets of the Companys cargo and/or mobile cargo
inspection system businesses; (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Buyer to license any Company Intellectual Property or provide any transition
services (including manufacturing services); and (iii) nothing in this
Agreement shall require the Buyer to initiate or participate in any legal
proceeding with respect to any such matters.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or (iii)
required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect
prior to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the
Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make any payments in connection
with the fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.6.

 



 

6.7. _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall consult with the
other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) each of the foregoing parties may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC
Reports (or, in the case of the Buyer, in its comparable registration
statements, forms, reports, proxy statements and other documents filed or
furnished with the SEC), so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other party), (ii) a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party hereto, issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required
by requirements under Law, and (iii) these restrictions shall not apply to any
Company communications regarding an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal
or a Recommendation Change Notice.

 



 

6.8. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the MBCA for officers
and directors of Massachusetts corporations. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a written request
therefor; provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced

 



      
 

 



 

provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the MBCA, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable law.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the Articles of Organization and By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company (the "Current DandO Insurance") with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at
least the same coverage containing terms, conditions and exclusions that are
not, in the aggregate, less favorable to the Indemnified Parties), so long as
the annual premium therefor would not exceed 250% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the Effective Time (such 250%, the "Maximum Premium"), or (ii)
purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to
the Current DandO Insurance and maintain such endorsement in full force and
effect for its full term; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend on such "tail" policy more than an
amount per year equal to the Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the event, but for the immediately preceding proviso, the Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation may obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to the Maximum Premium. If the
Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, a substitute policy with a reputable carrier
of at least the same coverage containing terms, conditions and exclusions that
are not less favorable to the Indemnified Parties for the remainder of such
period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(d) In the event the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or, at the Buyers option, the Buyer shall expressly
assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

 



 

(e) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the Persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section
6.8.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

6.9. _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur that causes or is reasonably
likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case
that would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a)
or 7.3(a) at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, or (b) any failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary
or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Merger. The parties hereto agree that the
Companys or the Buyers, as applicable, compliance or failure to comply with
this Section 6.9 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.3(b), as
applicable, has been satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, no such notice
shall be effective to cure or correct any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, or
constitute the waiver of any indemnification or other rights of the Buyer or
the Company, as applicable.

 



 

6.10. _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_.

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors of the Buyer, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall be permitted to adopt a resolution in advance
of the Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of
options to purchase Buyer Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of
Company Stock Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Section 16 Information" means information
regarding the Company Insiders and the number of shares of Company Common
Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be beneficially owned by
each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for options to purchase
Buyer Common Stock in connection with the Merger, which shall be provided by
the Company to the Buyer at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers
and directors of the Company who immediately after the Closing become subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to equity securities of the Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

6.11. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the later of
six (6) months after the Closing Date or March 31, 2017, the Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who was an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues employment with the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") (i) a base salary
or an hourly wage rate, as applicable, and annual bonus target that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and annual bonus target provided to such Company Employee
immediately before the Closing Date and (ii) health and welfare benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to either, as selected by the
Buyer in its sole discretion, (x) the health and welfare benefits provided to
such Company Employee immediately before the Closing Date or (y) the health
and welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining vesting, eligibility to participate and level
of benefits under the plans, policies, arrangements, or practices of the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Closing (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall, subject to applicable
law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Company Employee to waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the Old Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii)
all co-payments, deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(c) If the employment of any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to
an employment, change in control or other similar agreement) is terminated on
or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances
under which such Company

 



      
 

 



 

Employee would have received severance benefits under an Employee Benefit
Plan, the Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide that such
Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits from the Surviving
Corporation that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary to terminate any and all Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify
as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed so as to,
(i) prevent or restrict in any way the right of the Buyer to terminate,
reassign, promote or demote any employee, independent contractor, director or
other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or to cause any of
the foregoing actions) at any time following the Closing Date, or to change
(or cause the change of) the title, powers, duties, responsibilities,
functions, locations, salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of
employment or service of any such service providers at any time following the
Closing Date; (ii) constitute an amendment or modification of any plan; or
(iii) create any third party rights in any such current or former service
provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof); or (iv) obligate the Buyer to adopt or maintain any
particular plan or program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at
any time or prevent the Buyer from modifying or terminating any such plan,
program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time, subject to
any required agreement of the counterparty thereto.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Section 6.11, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Company Employee or other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.11 or is intended to be, shall
constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Buyer, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof.

 



 

(g) The provisions of Section 6.11(a) through 6.11(c) shall not apply to
Persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United
States, it being agreed that such Persons shall be treated in accordance with
applicable law and the terms of any contracts covering them.

 



 

6.12. _Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all
necessary action to cause the Company Rights to cease to be outstanding as of
the Effective Time and to terminate the Company Rights Agreement, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without payment of any consideration
in respect thereof.

 



 

6.13. _Security Holder Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each of the Company and the Buyer shall keep the other party hereto
informed of, and consult and cooperate with such party in connection with, any
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement brought by any shareholder of the Company or
any holder of the Companys other securities against the Company and/or its

 



      
 

 



 

directors or officers. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall notify the
other promptly of the commencement of any such shareholder litigation of which
it has received written notice.

 



 

6.14. _WARN Act Compliance_. The Company shall provide to the Buyer at the
Closing a complete and accurate list of all "employment losses" at the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as that term is defined in the WARN Act, which
occurred in the 90 calendar days preceding the Closing, which list shows the
name, date of separation, whether the individual resigned or was terminated by
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and facility or operating unit of each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who suffered such an
employment loss in such period (the "WARN List"). The Company (or applicable
Subsidiary of the Company) shall give all necessary WARN Act notices with
respect to employment losses that occur prior to the Closing Date with respect
to any employees employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.15. _Company Permits_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in full force and
effect all of the Company Permits.

the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company to
such effect.

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 

 ** 
TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT**

 



 

8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time (with respect to Section 8.1(b)
through 8.1(h), by written notice by the terminating party to the other party,
specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination
is made), whether before or, subject to the terms hereof, after approval of
this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company; or

 



 

(b) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by December 20, 2016 (the "Outside Date") (provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available
to any party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date, as it may be extended
hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if by December 20, 2016, the
Closing has not occurred due to the non-satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) (to the extent related to antitrust
laws), the Outside Date may be extended by three months, upon the election of
the Buyer in its sole discretion (the "First Extension Period"); and (ii) if
by the end of the First Extension Period the Closing has not occurred due to
the non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c)
(to the extent related to antitrust laws), the Outside Date may be extended by
an additional three months, upon the mutual consent of the Buyer and the
Company; or

 



 

(c) by either the Buyer or the Company if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction located in the United States or in any jurisdiction set forth on
Schedule 6.6 shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling
or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect
of permanently restraining, enjoining

 



      
 

 



 

or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party
hereto shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(c) if the issuance of any such order, decree, ruling or other
action, or the failure of such order, decree, ruling or other action to be
resisted, resolved or lifted, is attributable to the failure of such party (or
any Affiliate of such party) to perform in any material respect any covenant
in this Agreement required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of
such party) at or prior to the Effective Time; or

 



 

(d) by either the Buyer or the Company if at the Company Meeting at which a
vote on the Company Voting Proposal is taken, the Required Company Shareholder
Vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal shall not have been obtained; or

 



 

(e) by the Buyer if (i) there shall have been a Company Board Recommendation
Change or the Company Board shall have approved or publicly recommended a
Superior Proposal (or the Company Board resolves to do any of the foregoing)
or (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in each case, whether or not permitted by
Section 6.1; or

 



 

(f) by the Company, pursuant to clause (y) of the second sentence of _Section
6.1(b)_ prior to the time the Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained,
subject to the Companys compliance in all material respects with _Section
6.1_, _provided_ , that the termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ shall not be effective unless and until the
Company has paid, or has caused to be paid, the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ to the Buyer or its designee and
concurrently with its termination of this Agreement the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into an Alternative Definitive Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal;

 



 

(g) by the Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied, and
(ii) if such breach is reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (x) 20 Business Days following receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Buyer
and (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ that the Buyer is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement; or

 



 

(h) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) not to be satisfied, and (ii) if such breach is reasonably capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 20 Business
Days following receipt by the Buyer of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from the Company and (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ that
the Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant under this Agreement.

 



 

8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Buyer, the
Company, the Transitory Subsidiary or their respective

 



      
 

 



 

officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates; provided that (a) any such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any fraud or
knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement and (b) the provisions of
Section 5.2 (Confidentiality), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination),
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses) and Article IX (Miscellaneous) of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay the Buyer the Company Termination Fee in the event
that this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(e);

 



 

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or

 



 

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, (x) any Acquisition Proposal has
been received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives which has become known to the public, or (y) any
Person shall have publicly proposed or publicly disclosed any Acquisition
Proposal or an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal (and, in each case, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(d), such Acquisition Proposal or publicly proposed or publicly disclosed
intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification at
least thirty (30) days before the Company Meeting), (B) this Agreement is
terminated (x) by the Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (
_provided_ that (I) the Company Meeting shall not have occurred at or prior to
the time of such termination and (II) there has been no injunction, order,
ruling, decree, judgment or similar order by any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction which prevented the Company Meeting from having
occurred at or prior to the Outside Date), or (y) by the Buyer or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(d), or (z) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(g) due
to a material breach by the Company of any covenant set forth in this
Agreement and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company shall have consummated any Acquisition Proposal
(substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty percent (20%) threshold set
forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") (a " _Qualifying
Transaction_ ") or entered into a definitive agreement providing for any
Qualifying Transaction;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay any
Company Termination Fee if, at the time of termination of this Agreement, the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is in material breach of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be paid to the Buyer by wire
transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the date of
termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(ii) shall be
paid to the Buyer by wire transfer of same-day funds prior to or concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(iii)
shall be paid to the Buyer by wire transfer of same-day funds (i) within two
(2) Business Days after the date on which the definitive agreement providing
for the Qualifying Transaction referenced in clause (C) of Section 8.3(b)(iii)
is entered into or (ii) if there is no such agreement, upon the consummation
of such Qualifying Transaction. In the event that the Buyer or its designee
shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), together with
reimbursement of any applicable expenses and interest pursuant to Section
8.3(d), the receipt of the Company Termination Fee and reimbursement of any
applicable expenses and interest pursuant to Section 8.3(d) shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives
arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 8.3(b) shall limit the rights of the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary under Section 9.10 prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) The Buyer shall pay the Company a cash termination fee of $11.0 million
(the "Buyer Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by the Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and at the time of such
termination all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied
or waived other than any condition with respect to antitrust laws set forth in
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c). Any fee due under this Section 8.3(d) shall
be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)
Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If the Company or the Buyer fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, the Buyer or the
Company commences an action that results in a judgment against the Company or
the Buyer, as the case may be, for the payment set forth in this Section 8.3,
the party against which judgment was issued shall pay the other party its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date such payment was actually received. If the party against which
judgment was issued fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to this Section
8.3, it shall pay the other party interest on such amount at the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street

 



      
 

 



 

Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment is actually received.

 



 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

 



 

8.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of any party, but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further
approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement
may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

8.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other
parties hereto with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

8.6. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order
to be effective, require action by the respective Board of Directors of the
applicable parties.

therein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Effective Time and this Article IX.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered for purposes of this Section 9.2 by giving the
other parties to this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

 



 

9.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing)

 



      
 

 



 

constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance
on any such prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent
not embodied in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

9.4. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.8 (with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries
following the Effective Time), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not
be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to
create any agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereto.

 



 

9.5. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided, however,
that the Transitory Subsidiary may assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to another direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer without
the consent of the Company. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.6. _Severability; Construction_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties hereto intend that the provisions of Article VIII and Section
9.10, including the remedies and limitations thereon, be construed as an
integral provision of this Agreement and that such provisions, remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes a partys
rights hereunder or increases a partys liability or obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.7. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all

 



      
 

 



 

parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered by facsimile transmission or by an electronic scan delivered by
electronic mail. Signatures received as a ".pdf" attachment to electronic mail
shall be treated as original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

9.8. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent arises,
this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party
because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All references to "$"
or USD herein shall be references to U.S. Dollars.

 



 

9.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

 



 

9.10. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement,
the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary
damages) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, including, if
applicable, specific performance to cause any party hereto to effect the
Closing who has not effected the Closing in accordance with this Agreement at
the time when the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section
1.3, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each
party acknowledges and agrees that (i) each party is entitled to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement notwithstanding the
availability of any monetary remedy, (ii) the availability of any monetary
remedy (A) is not intended to and does not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be
construed to

 



      
 

 



 

diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to specific
enforcement, and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor the Buyer would have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

9.11. _Submission to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._

 



 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Boston,
Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11(b)_.

 



 

9.12. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections and/or subsections contained in Article III, in the case of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or Article IV, in the case of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, and the disclosure in any Section shall qualify only the
corresponding Section or subsection in Article III or Article IV, as the case
may be, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The inclusion
of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, or in any update thereto, shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or is
outside the Ordinary Course of

 



      
 

 



 

Business. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material.

 



 

9.13. _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the knowledge of the individuals identified in
Section 9.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule after reasonable inquiry.

This Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") to the Rights Agreement dated as of
April 17, 2008 between American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation, and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, a New York
corporation, as rights agent, as amended on December 18, 2014 (the
"Agreement") is made and is effective as of June 20, 2016. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the respective
meanings accorded to them in the Agreement.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company and Rights Agent have previously entered into the
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") has adopted a
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among the
Company, OSI Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), and Apple
Merger Sub, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation wholly owned by the Buyer (the
"Transitory Subsidiary") (the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary are
collectively referred to herein as the "Other Parties") at a meeting of the
Board held on June 20, 2016 (the "Meeting"), pursuant to which the Transitory
Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger");

 



 

WHEREAS, upon the effectiveness of the Merger, the Other Parties collectively
will acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of the Companys Common
Stock, $0.662/3 par value per share (the "Companys Common Stock");

 



 

WHEREAS, the acquisition of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of the
Companys Common Stock would result in the acquiring entity or entities being
deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" under the Agreement, which would trigger
certain events pursuant to the terms of the Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board has determined that, in connection with the Merger
Agreement, it is necessary and desirable to amend the Agreement prior to the
Company entering into the Merger Agreement so that (i) the Other Parties will
not thereby become Acquiring Persons under the Agreement, (ii) neither a
Distribution Date nor a Stock Acquisition Date will thereby occur, and (iii)
the Expiration Date of the Agreement will be immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as defined in the Merger Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, no Distribution Date has occurred; and

 



 

WHEREAS, a majority of the Board has approved and authorized this Amendment
pursuant to Section 27 of the Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. The definition of "Acquiring Person" in Section 1 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

      
 

 



 

"Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who or which, together with all
Affiliates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the
shares of Common Stock then outstanding, but shall not include

 



 

(a) the Company,

 



 

(b) any Subsidiary of the Company,

 



 

(c) any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the
Company,

 



 

(d) any Person organized, appointed, or established by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the terms of any plan described in
clause (c) above,

 



 

(e) any Person who

 



 

(i) is entitled to report, and has reported or is required to report such
ownership on Schedule 13G under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or
successor report) or on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable
or successor report) which Schedule 13D does not state any intention to or
reserve the right to control or influence the management or policies of the
Company or engage in any of the actions specified in Item 4 of such Schedule
(other than a disposition of the Common Stock) (a "13G Holder") and,

 



 

(ii) together with all Affiliates of such Person, is the Beneficial Owner of
shares of Common Stock of the Company representing less than 20% of the shares
of Common Stock of the Company then outstanding,

 



 

(iii) provided, however, that a Person who was deemed a 13G Holder shall no
longer be deemed such if such Person files a statement on Schedule 13D
pursuant to Rule 13d-1(a), 13d-1(e), 13d-1(f) or 13d-1(g) of the General Rules
and Regulations under the Exchange Act, and shall be deemed an Acquiring
Person if it is the Beneficial Owner of in excess of 14.9% of the Common Stock
of the Company then outstanding at any point from the time it first files such
a statement on Schedule 13D; further provided that if at the time of such
filing such Persons Beneficial Ownership is in excess of 14.9%, then such
Person shall, if requested to do so by the Company, within a specified number
of Business Days (to be specified by the Company, but in no case fewer than 10
Business Days) following such request from the Company to such Person, reduce
its Beneficial Ownership (together with that of all Affiliates of such Person)
to 14.9% or less of the Common Stock of the Company before being deemed an
"Acquiring Person" but shall be deemed an "Acquiring Person" if after reducing
its Beneficial Ownership to 14.9% or less it subsequently becomes the
Beneficial Owner of in excess of 14.9% of the Common Stock of the Company or
if, prior to reducing its Beneficial Ownership to 14.9% or less, it increases
(or makes any offer or takes any other action

 



      
 

 



 

that would increase) its Beneficial Ownership of the then-outstanding Common
Stock of the Company, other than as a result of a repurchase of Common Stock
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of
the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any Person or entity
organized, appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to the
terms of any such plan (any such repurchase being hereinafter referred to as a
"Company Stock Buyback"), above the lowest Beneficial Ownership of such Person
at any time during such 10-day period,

 



 

(f) any Person who

 



 

(i) within 10 Business Days of being requested by the Company to advise it
regarding the same, certifies to the Company that such Person acquired shares
of Common Stock in excess of 14.9% inadvertently or without knowledge of the
terms of the Rights; provided, however, that if the Person requested to so
certify fails to do so within 10 Business Days, then such Person shall become
an Acquiring Person immediately after such 10 Business Day period,

 



 

(ii) together with all of such Persons Affiliates, thereafter does not
acquire additional shares of Common Stock while the Beneficial Owner of 15% or
more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, and

 



 

(iii) if requested to do so by the Company, within a specified number of
Business Days (to be specified by the Company, but in no case fewer than 10
Business Days) following such request from the Company to such Person, reduced
its Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock to below 15% of the Common Stock then
outstanding; provided, however, that if the Person requested to so reduce its
Beneficial Ownership fails to do so within such specified number of Business
Days, then such Person shall become an Acquiring Person immediately after such
specified number of Business Days;

 



 

(g) any Person who becomes the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares
of Common Stock then outstanding (20% in the case of a 13G Holder) solely as a
result of a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding due
to a Company Stock Buyback, unless and until such Person, after becoming aware
that such Person has become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock (20% in the case of a 13G Holder),
increases (or makes any offer or takes any other action that would increase)
its Beneficial Ownership of the then-outstanding Common Stock of the Company
(other than as a result of a Company Stock Buyback); or

 



 

(h) OSI Systems, Inc. OSI Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"),
and Apple Merger Sub, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation wholly owned by the
Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary") or any other subsidiary of the Buyer (the
Buyer, the

 



      
 

 



 

Transitory Subsidiary, and any other subsidiary of the Buyer are collectively
referred to herein as the "Other Parties"), solely by reason of the execution,
delivery or performance of the Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted by the
Board at the meeting of the Board held on June 20, 2016, as it may be amended
from time to time (the "Merger Agreement"), the consummation of the Merger (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) or the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary pursuant to the Merger
or compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement."

 



 

2. The definition of "Distribution Date" set forth in Section 1 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following sentence to the end of that definition:

 



 

"Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Distribution
Date shall be deemed to have occurred by reason of (i) the execution,
delivery, performance or amendment of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the
performance or consummation of the Merger or (iii) the performance or
consummation of any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement."

 



 

3. The definition of "Stock Acquisition Date" set forth in Section 1 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following sentence to the end of that definition:

 



 

"Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Stock
Acquisition Date shall be deemed to have occurred by reason of (i) the
execution, delivery, performance or amendment of the Merger Agreement, (ii)
the performance or consummation of the Merger or (iii) the performance or
consummation of any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement."

 



 

4. The first sentence of Section 7.1 of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

 



 

"Except as otherwise provided herein, the registered holder of any Rights
Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby in whole or in part at
any time from and after the Distribution Date and at or prior to the earlier
of (i) Close of Business on April 16, 2018 and (ii) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "Expiration Date")."

 



 

5. Section 11.1.2 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following sentence to the end of that section:

 



 

"Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, no event requiring
an adjustment under this Section 11.1.2 shall be deemed to have occurred by
reason of (i) the execution, delivery, performance or amendment of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) the performance or consummation of the Merger or (iii) the
performance or consummation of any other transaction contemplated by the
Merger Agreement."

 



 

6. Section 15 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph to the end of that section:

 



       
 

 



 

"Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give any holder of Rights or
any other Person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this
Agreement in connection with any transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement."

 



 

7. A new Section 35 is hereby added to the end of the Agreement to read in its entirety as follows:

 



 

"35. _Merger Agreement_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement
or of any amendment thereto or (ii) the performance or consummation of any
other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall not result in a
Common Stock Event or in any way permit any Rights to be exercised pursuant to
Section 11.1.2, Section 13, or otherwise for any capital stock, whether Common
Stock, Preferred Stock, Equivalent Preferred Stock or other preferred stock,
nor will such execution, acquisition, or consummation result in the occurrence
of a Stock Acquisition Date, a Distribution Date, or any other separation of
the Rights from the underlying shares of Common Stock or require or permit the
Rights to be evidenced by, or to be transferable pursuant to, certificates
separate from certificates for the shares of Common Stock, nor entitle or
permit the holders of the Rights to exercise the Rights or otherwise affect
the rights of the holders of the Rights, including giving the holders of the
Rights the right to acquire any capital stock, cash, or other property of any
party to the Merger Agreement or any Affiliate of the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall be inapplicable to the events described in clauses (i) and
(ii) above, and all Rights issued and outstanding under the Agreement shall
expire immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement)."

 



 

8. Except as specifically amended by this Amendment, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
