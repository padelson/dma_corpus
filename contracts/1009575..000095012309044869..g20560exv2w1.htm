(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (i)&nbsp;trade credit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
and (ii)&nbsp;those items set forth in clauses (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i)&nbsp;and (j)&nbsp;of the definition of
&#147;Indebtedness&#148; set forth herein (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be reflected on the

excess (if any) of (i)&nbsp;the Cash of the Companies, based upon the most recently available bank
statements of the Companies as adjusted for deposits, checks and other disbursements not otherwise
reflected in such bank statements, over (ii)&nbsp;amounts used to satisfy Indebtedness pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.04(a). In the event that, after giving effect to the distribution of Cash pursuant to
this Section&nbsp;2.04(b) and the application of Cash to pay Indebtedness pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.04(a),
any remaining Cash is insufficient to cover checks and other disbursements not yet paid by the
relevant financial institution, such deficiencies shall be treated as an account payable on the
Closing Balance Sheet. The Seller may cause the Companies to make payments under this Section
2.04(b) in the form of a dividend, subject to compliance with applicable Law. All such payments
shall be made not later than immediately prior to the Closing.

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.04 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement (including all exhibits and the
Disclosure Schedule), the Transition Services Agreement, the Parent Guarantee and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, between the Seller and the Purchasers with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.05 <U>Assignment</U>. This Agreement may not be assigned without the express
written consent of the parties hereto (except by operation of law, including without limitation,
the WebMD Merger, or any reorganization, consolidation or merger of Parent in which Parent is not
the surviving entity); except that the Purchasers shall, prior to the Closing, assign this
Agreement without the consent of the Seller or Parent to Newco, <U>provided</U>, that such
assignment shall not relieve the Purchasers of all of their obligations under this Agreement unless
and until the consummation of the Closing and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that Newco shall
have executed the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and received a cash contribution from each
Purchaser in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.04(d), at which point, Newco shall have assumed the
Purchasers&#146; rights and obligations hereunder in full and Newco shall become responsible for the
obligations assigned to it and the Purchasers shall be fully relieved of all of their obligations
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement
to the Purchasers or a Purchaser shall apply to Newco unless the context otherwise requires.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.06 <U>Amendment</U>. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a)&nbsp;by
an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller and the Purchasers or (b)&nbsp;by a
waiver in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.07.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.07 <U>Waiver</U>. Any party to this Agreement may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document
delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements of
the other party or conditions to such party&#146;s obligations contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound
thereby and, if required under applicable Law, countersigned by the other party. Any waiver of any
term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such
rights.

representation or warranty in this Agreement in respect of which such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. The inclusion of any matter, information or item in the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by the Seller or any of the
Companies to any third-party or otherwise imply that any such matter, information or item is
material or creates a measure for materiality or Material Adverse Effect for the purposes of this

of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a)&nbsp;submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The
City of New York for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought
by any party hereto and (b)&nbsp;irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense,
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that
the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any
of the above-named courts.

no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)&nbsp;acknowledges
that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this
