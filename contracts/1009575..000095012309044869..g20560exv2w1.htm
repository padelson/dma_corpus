As used in this Section 5.06, " _Competitive Business_ " means the business of designing, manufacturing or distributing porous plastic products or designing, manufacturing or distributing of implants used in human cranial and facial reconstructive surgery; _provided_ , that (i) none of the Seller Businesses (as defined below) shall be deemed to be a Competitive Business, (ii) the distribution, marketing or promotion of any medical device by WebMD that is manufactured by an Independent Third Party shall not be deemed to be a Competitive Business so long as none of Parent and the Seller shall have breached, or permitted any of their controlled Affiliates to breach, any of the provisions of Section 5.03; and (iii) each Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Parent, the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries will, during the Restricted Period, provide services to or receive services from Independent Third Parties that may be engaged in Competitive Businesses and in no event shall the provision or receipt of any such services in and of itself be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.06, except that neither Parent nor the Seller nor any of their controlled Affiliates shall manufacture any implant used in human cranial and facial reconstructive surgery or provide technical manufacturing information to any manufacturer of implants used in human cranial and facial reconstructive surgery relating to the manufacturing of implants used in human cranial and facial reconstructive surgery and nothing in this clause (iii) shall relieve the Seller, Parent or any of their respective controlled Affiliates from their respective obligations set forth in Section 5.03. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.06(a), Parent, the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries may, during the Restricted Period, (i) engage in or own any interest in any entity that engages in any of the businesses or activities in which Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) are engaged as of the date of this Agreement or may be engaged in the future (other than a Competitive Business), to the extent such businesses or activities are a reasonable extension of any of the businesses or activities engaged in by Parent, the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) as of the date of this Agreement and do not constitute a Competitive Business (collectively, the " _Seller Businesses_ "); (ii) own an interest of less than 5% of the voting securities of any publicly traded company; and (iii) acquire and, after such acquisition, own an interest in another Person (or its successor) engaging in a Competitive Business or owning an entity engaging in a Competitive Business if (A) such Competitive Business generated less than 20% of such Persons aggregate revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person or (B) Parent or the Seller, as applicable, causes the acquired Person (or its successor) to divest itself of the Competitive Business as soon as is reasonably practicable after such acquisition is consummated and in any event enters into an agreement to make such a divestiture within nine (9) months following the date of acquisition. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Section 5.06 will cease to be applicable in the event Parent (or any of its successors, including, without limitation, WebMD as successor to Parent in the WebMD Merger) is acquired by an Independent Third Party (whether by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger or otherwise),

excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the acquisition of Parent by WebMD in
the WebMD Merger. 

   

 (d) During the Restricted Period, neither Parent nor the Seller shall, and each shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, hire any employee of any of the Companies or solicit any employee of any of the Companies to leave his or her employment in order to accept employment with Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that nothing contained in this Section 5.06(d) shall prohibit Parent, the Seller or any of controlled Affiliates from soliciting employees through general advertisements not targeted at the employees of any of the Companies or from hiring any Person in the event that such Person shall have previously left the employ of any of the Companies at least six (6) months prior to the date of hire. 

   

 (e) During the Restricted Period, each Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the Companies) not to, hire any employee of Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) or solicit any employee of Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) to leave his or her employment in order to accept employment with a Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies); _provided_ , that nothing contained in this Section 5.06(e) shall prohibit the Purchasers or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Companies) from soliciting employees through general advertisements not targeted at the employees of any of Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries or from hiring any Person in the event that such Person shall have previously left the employ of Parent, the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries at least six (6) months prior to the date of hire. 

   

 (f) The Seller acknowledges that the covenants of the Seller set forth in this Section 5.06 are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach by the Seller of any provision of this Section 5.06 will result in irreparable injury to a Purchaser. The Seller acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, a Purchaser shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits or other benefits arising therefrom, as well as such other damages as may be appropriate. The Seller has independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.06 are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of a Purchaser. 

   

 (g) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character, duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Section 5.06 are unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties that these provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only those restrictions on the Sellers conduct that are reasonable in light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to a Purchaser the benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of this Section 5.06 because taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to the Purchasers the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

 Section 5.07 _Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the requirements of Section 5.07(b) and 5.07(c) below and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Purchaser shall have sole responsibility for obtaining insurance coverage for the Companies and their respective operations effective as of the Closing and agrees that it will not seek recovery for claims arising after the Closing under the insurance policies of the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller (other than the Companies after the Closing) except (other than with respect to those policies in the name of Parent) under those policies identified in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (b) With respect to the policies identified in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule the Purchasers, at the sole cost and expense of the Purchasers, if any, with the cooperation and reasonable assistance of the Seller prior to and after the Closing, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause Newco and the Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to, have the following changes in such policies take place at or as promptly as is commercially reasonable after the Closing: 

    

 (i) replace the Seller with Newco as the named insured, on those policies (other than the Environmental Policy (Policy Number 3725-18-51)) that, on the date of this Agreement, name the Seller as the named insured; 

   

 (ii) with respect to the Environmental Policy (Policy Number 3725-18-51), replace the Seller with Newco as the named insured and add as additional insured on such policy Parent (or its successor) and all of its Subsidiaries including the Seller; and 

   

 (iii) with respect to policies (except for workers compensation and executive protection) in the name of Porex and/or Porex Surgical immediately prior to the Closing, cause Newco to be named as an additional insured on each such policy and Parent (or its successor) and all of its Subsidiaries including the Seller to be named as an additional insured on each such policy. 

  

 Except with respect to those policies identified in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule as being in the name of Parent, neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies following the Closing) shall have access to any such policy described in this Section 5.07(b) on which it is named as the insured or an additional insured with respect to any risks insured thereunder that do not arise out of the conduct of business or operations of any of the Companies (whether before or after the Closing) or otherwise relate to any of the Companies 

   

 (c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Seller shall (i) pay all premiums required to be paid under the insurance policies set forth in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms thereof and (ii) notify each issuer of each policy of the actions contemplated by Section 5.07(b) and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate completion of such actions effective as of the Closing. 

   

 (d) Following the Closing, the Purchasers shall, or shall cause Newco or the Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to continually maintain and keep in full force 

    ##### 

  

    

and effect the insurance policies with respect to which, pursuant to Section
5.07(b), following the Closing Parent (or its successor) and all of its
Subsidiaries including the Seller are named as additional insureds and shall
not replace any such policy or fail to maintain Parent (or its successor)
and all of its Subsidiaries including the Seller as additional insureds for a
period of 10 years from and after the Closing unless either: 

    

 (i) the Purchasers provide or cause Newco or the Companies to provide, at their sole cost and expense, an unlimited extended reporting period for the benefit of Parent and the Seller with respect to any such replaced policy with the same limits and the same retroactive dates; or 

   

 (ii) the Purchasers provide, or cause Newco or the Companies to provide, at their sole cost and expense, replacement insurance that is comparable in all material respects to the insurance policy so replaced and naming Parent (or its successor) and all of its Subsidiaries as additional insureds thereunder. 

 

Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 5.07(d), the Purchasers, Newco and
the Companies shall not be obligated to collectively expend in any annual
period for any such policy of insurance for which Parent and its Subsidiaries
are to be named as additional insureds more than 150% of the annual premium
in effect for such policy on the date of this Agreement. If the annual premium
for any such policy of insurance would exceed 150% of the annual premium in
effect for such policy on the date of this Agreement, the Purchasers, Newco
and the Companies shall only be obligated to use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure such insurance under such policy (or a replacement policy)
as can be obtained with the payment of an annual premium of 150% of the annual
premium in effect for such policy on the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.08 _Public Announcements; Notices to Governmental Authorities_. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto have agreed to the forms of press release, employee communication materials and customer communication materials (the " _Initial Communications_ ") to be issued promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall agree to the forms of Initial Communications to be issued promptly after the Closing. The Seller, the Purchasers and any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall consult with each other before issuing, and shall provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, all other public announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that each of the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, may, without the prior written consent of the other party, make any such announcement that (i) contains only information consistent with the Initial Communications or (ii) it in good faith believes is necessary or advisable in connection with any requirement of applicable Law, or any listing agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market (it being understood and agreed that each party shall use reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party prior to issuing such public announcement, and shall promptly provide the other party hereto with copies of any such announcement or other communication). The Purchasers hereby consent to Parent filing a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this Agreement, which Current Report may include a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit.

Parent and the Seller agree that between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, Parent and the Seller shall not, and shall take all action necessary to ensure that none of the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall (other than in connection with the WebMD Merger):

The parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers and obtain any waivers, consents or approvals from third-parties and Governmental Authorities as may be required to satisfy all applicable conditions to Closing, to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Termination Date.

Each Purchaser shall take all necessary or proper actions to satisfy its obligations as set forth in Section 2.02(b) including providing Newco with cash contributions equal to no less than such Purchasers Pro Rata Portion of the Cash Purchase Price and enforcing the rights of such Purchaser under the limited partnership agreement governing the affairs of such Purchaser. 

  

ARTICLE VI 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 Section 6.01 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) As of the Closing, the Purchasers agree to provide, or to cause Newco, the Companies or one of the Purchasers other Affiliates to provide, the employees of the Companies following the Closing, for a period of one (1) year after the Closing, with employee benefits that are, in the aggregate comparable to those employee benefits provided to the employees of the Companies immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (other than equity or equity-related benefits). 

   

 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of a Purchaser, Newco, the Companies or one of the Purchasers other Affiliates in which the employees of the Companies may be eligible to participate pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the Purchasers shall, or shall cause Newco, the Companies or one of their Affiliates to: (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or would otherwise not be excluded or required under the plans in which such employees were participating immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) credit all deductibles and co-pays under any of Porexs or the other Companies health plans, during the applicable plan year that includes the Closing, towards deductibles and co-pays under the health plan of the Purchasers, the Companies or one of the Purchasers other Affiliates; and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Porex, the other Companies or Parent for purposes of (A) eligibility to participate, (B) vesting and (C) benefit accrual (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, severance policy, or vacation, sick, holiday or other paid leave policy of a Purchaser, the Companies or one of the Purchasers other Affiliates in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing, in each case, to the same extent taken into account under the corresponding plan or policy in which such employees participated immediately prior to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not be construed
in any way that would result in a duplication of benefits provided to any
such employee. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article VI, the parties do not intend for this Article VI, or any term, provision, condition or agreement contained herein, to amend any plans or arrangements. This Article VI shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Article VI, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Article VI. Nothing in this Article VI is intended to interfere with the Companies or, from and after the Closing, the Purchasers right to amend or terminate any plans or arrangements or the employment or provision of services by any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that from and after the Closing the Companies become obligated to make payments (" _Change of Control Payments_ ") to employees of the Companies pursuant to any Change of Control Plan (as defined below), (x) the Companies and the Purchasers shall remain liable for the portion of the Change of Control Payments in an amount up to and including $855,000 in the aggregate (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and (y) the Seller shall be liable for and shall, following written notice from the Purchasers, promptly reimburse the Purchasers for any Change of Control Payments exceeding the Maximum Amount. The Sellers liability and reimbursement obligations under the preceding sentence shall not apply to any payments to employees of the Companies pursuant to any Severance Plans (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Change of Control Plan_ " means a plan or agreement (or portion thereof) listed on Section 6.01(d)(A) of the Disclosure Schedule or any similar plan or agreement in existence immediately prior to the Closing which is not a Severance Plan and pursuant to which an employee of any Company becomes entitled to receive payments from any of the Companies solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the satisfaction of any post-Closing service requirements that may be imposed under such plan or agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Severance Plan_ " means a plan or agreement providing for severance or similar termination payments or benefits that become payable by any Company only upon a termination of employment (including, without limitation, any severance or similar termination payments or benefits pursuant to the plans and agreements (or portions thereof) set forth in Section 6.01(d)(B)) of the Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the amount of any Change of Control Payment actually paid by any Company to an employee is reduced by any applicable withholding or employment taxes, such Company shall be deemed to have paid the gross amount of such Change of Control Payment for purposes of this Section 6.01(d). 

   

ARTICLE VII 
 TAX MATTERS 

   

 Section 7.01 _Tax Indemnities_. 

  

 (a) The Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the Purchasers and their Affiliates harmless against all Excluded Taxes and associated expenses. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Purchasers shall be severally, and not jointly, responsible for and shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless against all Taxes and associated expenses other than Excluded Taxes. 

   

 (c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the date of the Closing shall be: 

    

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.06), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if the taxable period ended on the date of the Closing; and 

   

 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the date of the Closing and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. 

   

 (iii) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and/or the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based upon the method employed in Sections 7.01(c)(i) and 7.01(c)(ii) above taking into account the type of Tax to which the credit or refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(c) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the date of the Closing. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies. 

  

 (d) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under this Section 7.01 shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority is due; _provided_ , that the parties shall comply with their obligation to promptly notify each other under Section 9.05; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two (2) days before it is due to the appropriate taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Seller or one of its Affiliates receives an assessment or other notice of Taxes due with respect to the Companies for which the Seller is not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to Section 7.01(a), then the Purchasers shall pay such Taxes, or if the Seller or one of its Affiliates pays such Taxes, then the Purchasers or the Companies shall pay to the Seller the amount of such Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible within five (5) days following such payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions 

    ##### 

  

    

of Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate taxing authority will
be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final determination to
such effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or court. 

   

 (e) Transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, outside the ordinary course of business of the Companies and not contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as occurring on the next day and as such shall for purposes of this Agreement be treated (and consistently reported by the parties) as occurring in the taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning the day after the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 7.02 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Any refunds or similar benefits (including any interest paid with respect thereto) that are received by Porex or its Subsidiaries, and any amount credited or otherwise offset against any Tax to which a Purchaser or its Affiliates or Porex and its Subsidiaries become entitled, that relate to taxable periods (or portions of taxable periods) ending on or before the date of the Closing, except to the extent such item was taken into account in the determination of Closing Net Working Capital, shall be for the account of the Seller. The Seller shall also be entitled to all remaining payments in respect of the German Corporate Tax Credit determined as of December 31, 2006, which shall be remitted to the Seller promptly after receipt by any Company. The Purchasers shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, cause the Companies or other relevant entity to file for and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchasers shall permit the Seller to participate in (at the Sellers expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any such Tax refund, credit or similar benefit for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in the manner set forth in Section 7.01(c). 

   

 (b) Any amount otherwise payable by the Indemnifying Party under Section 7.01 shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit actually realized (either by cash refund or actual reduction of Taxes otherwise payable), net of any current Tax detriment actually realized (either by reduction in cash refund or actual increase in Taxes payable) in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, by the Indemnified Party, as a result of the tax payment or any underlying adjustment resulting in the obligation of the Indemnified Party to pay Taxes or other amounts for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible under Section 7.01 or the accrual or payment of such Taxes. 

   

 Section 7.03 _Contests_. 

  

 (a) After the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the other party or its Affiliates which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification under Section 7.01. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to such party) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If either party fails to give the other party prompt notice of an asserted 

    ##### 

  

    

Tax liability as required by this Section 7.03, then such party shall not
have any obligation to indemnify for any Loss arising out of such asserted
Tax liability, but only to the extent that failure to give such
notice results in an actual detriment to such party. 

   

 (b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing, the Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such Contest. 

   

 (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Seller may elect to direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01. If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, the Seller shall within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify the Purchasers of its intent to do so, and the Purchasers shall cooperate and shall cause the Companies to cooperate, at the Sellers expense, in each phase of such Contest. If the Seller elects to direct such Contest, then the Purchasers may participate in such Contest, at the Purchasers expense. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, the Purchasers may assume control of such Contest (at the Purchasers expense). If a Purchaser assumes control of such Contest (whether because the Seller elects not to assume control or because it is not entitled to control such Contest), then the Seller may participate, at its own expense, in the Contest. Neither the Seller nor any Purchaser may settle or compromise any asserted liability with respect to any Contest governed by this Section 7.03(c) without prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) The Purchasers and the Seller agree to reasonably cooperate, and agree to cause their Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Contest. 

   

 Section 7.04 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) The Seller shall prepare and file (or cause the Companies to prepare and file) all income and franchise Tax Returns relating to the Companies for taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing and all other Tax Returns required to be filed prior to the Closing Date, in each case in a manner consistent with prior practice to the extent permitted under applicable Law with respect to Tax Returns that solely include the Companies. 

   

 (b) The Purchasers shall prepare and file (or cause the Companies to prepare and file) all Tax Returns of the Companies that are not prepared by the Seller pursuant to subparagraph (a) above (including Straddle Periods); it being understood that all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Purchasers, except for such Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01, which the Seller shall pay in accordance with this Article VII. Such Tax Returns for the first period ending after the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by applicable Law. With respect to any such Tax Return that begins prior to the Closing Date or as to which Taxes are otherwise allocable to the Seller under Section 7.01 hereof, the Purchasers shall provide the Seller and its authorized representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement (with which the Purchasers will make available supporting schedules and information) certifying the amount 

     ##### 

  

     

of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to
Section 7.01 at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and the Seller and its
authorized representative shall have the right to review and approve (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such Tax Return and statement prior to
the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchasers agree to consult
and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the
review of such Tax Return and statement by the Seller or its authorized
representative. 

   

 (c) Each Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Seller to cause the filing of any amended Tax Return reasonably requested by the Seller relating to a taxable period (or portions thereof) of any of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date;  _provided_ , that the Seller will pay or reimburse a Purchaser for any reasonable professional fees incurred by such Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the preparation and filing of such amended Tax Return. 

   

 Section 7.05 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Seller and each Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchasers shall cause the Companies to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. The Seller and the Purchasers shall make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 7.05. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each of the Seller and the Purchasers shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents in its possession or under its control (or in the possession or under the control of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of any of the Companies for any taxable period that includes the date of the Closing and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchasers shall dispose of any such documents in their possession or under their control (or in the possession or under the control of their Affiliates), the other party shall be given an opportunity, after ninety (90) days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other partys expense). Any information obtained under this Section 7.05 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. 

  

 Section 7.06 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchasers shall be severally liable for, shall hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless against, and agree to pay any and all Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchasers and the Seller agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Purchasers to comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.07 _Tax Covenants_. 

  

 (a) Neither the Purchasers nor any Affiliate of the Purchasers shall take, or cause or permit the Companies to take, any action, or omit to take any action which could increase the Sellers or any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes. 

   

 (b) Neither the Purchasers nor any Affiliate of the Purchasers shall amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit any Company to amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any taxable period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before the date of the Closing without the prior written consent of the Seller. 

   

 Section 7.08 _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article VII, under any other indemnity provisions contained in this Agreement, and for any breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, as adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions. 

   

 (b) This Article VII shall be the sole provision governing indemnities for Taxes under this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that the provisions of Article IX shall not apply to Taxes. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to the Purchasers, Parent, the Seller, Affiliates or the Companies include their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof). 

   

 (e) Except for this Agreement, any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated, and all payments thereunder settled, immediately prior to the Closing with no payments permitted to be made thereunder on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) Payments by the Seller under this Article VII shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recoverable by the Purchasers, the Companies or any Affiliates of the Purchasers from any third-party with respect thereto. 

   

 Section 7.09 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Upon the request of the Purchasers, in connection with the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby, the Seller and Parent shall join with Newco in causing an express election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to be made for the Companies (other than the Foreign Companies) and shall cause similar elections to be made where appropriate for state Tax purposes (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). 

   ##### 

  

 

Newco shall be entitled to cause elections to be made under Section 338(g) of
the Code with respect to the Foreign Companies (collectively, the " _Section
338(g) Election_"). On or prior to December 10, 2009 (or such earlier date
that the Allocation is delivered to Sellers pursuant to this Section 7.09),
but in no event earlier than thirty (30) days following the Closing,
the Purchasers shall notify the Seller in writing with respect to which
Section 338(h)(10) Elections and Section 338(g) Elections will be made
pursuant to this Section 7.09. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the
last date on which the Section 338(h)(10) Election must be filed, the
Purchasers will deliver to the Seller all forms and other schedules and
documents necessary to file the Section 338(h)(10) Election, with reasonable
instructions to the Seller with respect to the signing and filing of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, and the Seller will comply with such
reasonable instructions in signing and filing the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Within forty-five (45) days following the Closing, the Purchasers
shall provide the Seller with an allocation of the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Companies taking into account any Section 338(h)(10) Election
or Section 338(g) Election made (the " _Allocation_ ") for the Sellers
review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). The Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Code
Sections 338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. If the Seller and the
Purchasers cannot agree on the proper Allocation, then the Seller and the
Purchasers shall submit the Allocation in dispute for resolution to BDO
Seidman, LLP (or, if such firm shall decline or be unable to act, or is not,
at the time of such submission, independent of the Purchasers and the Seller,
then to another independent valuation or accounting firm of international
reputation mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchasers), which
shall, as soon as practicable after such submission, determine and report to
the Seller and the Purchasers its resolution of the Allocation. The report of
such firm shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees for
such firm shall be paid in the same manner as the Independent Accounting Firm
as described in Section 2.08(b). The Allocation shall be binding upon the
Purchasers and the Seller and neither party (nor any of their Affiliates)
shall file any Tax Return, or take a position with a Tax authority, that is
inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Seller and the Purchasers hereby agree to revise the Allocation to reflect
any adjustment made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Options_. 

  

 (a) _Options_. In the event that subsequent to the Closing Date any current or former employee of a Company exercises options to purchase stock of Parent, which options were received by such employee in connection with the performance of services for such Company or any Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, and are outstanding on the Closing Date (the " _HLTH Options_ "), the Seller and the Purchasers agree and acknowledge that they shall report the exercise of the HLTH Options in accordance with Section 7.10(b). 

   

 (b) _Compensation Expense; Employment Taxes; Reimbursement_. Upon the exercise of the HLTH Options, the Seller or one of its Affiliates (and not the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates) shall (i) claim the compensation expense deduction associated with such exercise measured by the fair market value of the stock subject to the HLTH Options at the time of such exercise (less the exercise price) (the " _Compensation Deduction_ "), (ii) pay all employment and withholding Taxes resulting from such exercise and (iii) file all Tax Returns related to the payment of such employment and withholding Taxes. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) If, upon the subsequent disposition of an audit or other examination by a Governmental Authority (whether by settlement or otherwise), it is determined that a Compensation Deduction should properly have been reported by the Purchasers or one of their Affiliates and not by the Seller or one of its Affiliates, then: 

    

 (i) if necessary, the Seller shall notify the Purchasers and shall provide the Purchasers with adequate information so that it can reflect the Compensation Deduction on the appropriate Tax Returns; 

   

 (ii) the Purchasers shall pay the Seller the amount of any Tax Benefits realized by the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates that relates to any adjustments resulting from such Compensation Deduction within thirty (30) days of the date such Tax Benefits are realized; and 

   

 (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers shall only be required to take steps to obtain such Tax Benefit or to pay the Seller if, in the opinion of the Purchasers Tax counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller, the reporting of such Tax Benefit shall not subject the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates to the imposition of a penalty unless the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchasers for such penalty. 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Section 7.10, the party receiving the Tax Benefit shall be deemed to be subject to the maximum U.S. federal income Tax, state income Tax, and foreign income Tax rates then in effect and the Tax Benefit shall be deemed to have been realized at the time the adjustments giving rise to such Tax Benefit are properly reported on such partys federal income Tax Return.

 Section 9.02 _Indemnification by the Seller_. The Purchasers shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Seller for and against all Losses arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained in this Agreement (it being further understood that for purposes of this Section 9.02 all materiality, Material Adverse Effect and similar qualifications and exceptions contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded) and (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Seller or Parent contained in this Agreement.

those pertaining to products manufactured, designed and/or sold prior to or
after the Closing, except for claims or causes of action with respect to
which the Seller is obligated to indemnify the Purchasers pursuant to Section
9.02. 

   

 Section 9.04 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against either party for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or Action is received by such party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(i) and (ii) or Section 9.03(i) and (ii), unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds 1.75% of the Purchase Price after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for those Losses in excess of such amount; (ii) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section 9.02(i) and (ii) or Section 9.03(i) and (ii) shall be an amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price; _provided_ , that none of the foregoing limitations set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) herein shall apply to any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants set forth in Section 3.01, Section 3.02, Section 3.03, Section 3.23, Section 6.01(d) or Article VII, for which the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered shall equal the Purchase Price.

     ##### 

  

    

claim for, or have any right to, indemnification or any other recovery for any
Loss as a result of, or arising out of, relating to or in connection with,
such failures or terminations as described in this sentence. 

   

 (d) For all purposes of this Article IX, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any insurance, indemnification or other recoveries paid to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under any insurance policy or any other Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (after deducting the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such payment); and (ii) any Tax Benefits actually realized (either by Cash refund or actual reduction of Taxes otherwise payable) net of any Tax detriments actually realized (either by Cash refund or increase in Taxes otherwise payable) by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates during or prior to the Tax period in which the indemnification payment is made arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses. If a Tax Benefit or Tax detriment is incurred after an indemnification payment has been made, an appropriate adjusting payment shall be made by or to the Indemnified Party to give effect to clause (ii) above at the time that such Tax Benefit or Tax detriment is actually realized. 

   

 Section 9.05 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within thirty (30) days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises;  _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article. 

   

 (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim, demand or assessment made by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against it which may give rise to a claim for Losses under this Article IX, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Losses that may result from such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party timely elects to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnified Party; 

    ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to
exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment
of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnifying Party and the counsel for the Indemnifying Party concurs with
such assertion (which concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain separate
counsel (but no more than one (1) outside counsel, plus local counsel in each
jurisdiction where such counsel is reasonably required). The
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel, to the extent such fees and expenses are
incurred solely in connection with the matters with respect to which counsel
to the Indemnifying Party agrees there is conflict of interest. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake the defense of
any Third-Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified
Party shall not settle such claim or proceeding, unless the Indemnifying
Party consents in writing to such settlement. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the
Indemnifying Party fails to prosecute or withdraws from the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake
the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying Partys expense.
If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim and
proposes to settle such claim prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego
appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume
the defense of such Third-Party Claim. No such Third-Party Claim may be paid
or settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes or reassumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which may be withheld in
the Indemnified Partys sole discretion), enter into any settlement or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third-Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
other than solely the payment of money damages for which the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder 

   

 Section 9.06 _Remedies_. 

  

 (a) The Purchasers have conducted their own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, software, technology and prospects of the Companies and their respective businesses. The Purchasers acknowledge and agree that they and their representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Companies and their respective businesses for such purpose. The Purchasers and the Seller acknowledge and agree that they are not entitled to rely on any representations or warranties or other statements of fact or opinion, other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Purchasers and the Seller acknowledge and agree that, other than for claims and causes of action based on fraud, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchasers and the Seller for any breach by the other party of the representations and warranties in this Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Seller, on the one hand, or a Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other party under this Agreement to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable Law and to thereafter cause the sale of the Shares to be consummated. Each Purchaser hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of, the Purchasers under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.06(c) a party shall not in any respect waive its rights to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages), in the event the remedies provided for in this Section 9.06(c) are not available or are otherwise not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this Section 9.06(c) shall require any party to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this Section 9.06(c) prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article X (and pursuing damages after such termination). 

   

 (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of a Purchaser or the Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate its Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise thereto. 

   

 (e) Subject to the following sentence, in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event any Losses are recoverable under insurance policies or other collateral sources the Purchasers shall pursue recovery of such Losses under such insurance policies or other collateral sources; _provided_ , that in the event any amounts recovered or recoverable under insurance policies or other collateral sources are not received before any claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to Section 9.02, then the Purchasers shall pursue such insurance policies or collateral sources (other than as aforesaid), and in the event a Purchaser receives any recovery, the amount of such recovery (net of any costs incurred by such Purchaser in pursuing such recovery) shall be applied to refund any payments made by the Seller which would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment. If a Purchaser fails to 

     ##### 

  

    

pursue recovery against a customer or supplier, then the Seller shall, at its
sole cost and expense, have the right of subrogation to pursue such customer
or supplier and may take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such
rights of subrogation in its name or the name of the party from
whom subrogation is obtained. The Purchasers shall reasonably cooperate, and
cause their Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, with the Seller to pursue any
such subrogation claim; _provided_ , that if the Purchasers, at any time,
request that the Seller cease pursuing recovery against such customer or
supplier, the Seller shall cease pursuing such recovery and the Purchasers
shall (i) forfeit their claims for indemnification to the extent of the
subrogated claim for which such recovery was sought, (ii) refund to the
Seller any payment made by the Seller to a Purchaser in connection with such
claim and (iii) refund to the Seller the Sellers reasonable costs
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such claim. 

  

 (f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Purchasers acknowledge and agree that no representation or warranty is being made by or on behalf of the Seller with respect to the future operating or financial performance of the Companies. In connection with the Purchasers investigation of the Companies, the Purchasers have received certain estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, budgets and similar forward-looking statements, materials and information regarding or relating to the future operating and financial performance of the Companies. The Purchasers hereby acknowledge and agree that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, budgets and similar materials and information, that each Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that each Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans, budgets and similar forward-looking statements, materials and information provided to it regarding the Companies. 

   

 Section 9.07 _Tax Matters_. Anything in this Article IX to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters (excluding Section 3.14) shall be solely governed by Article VII and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Article IX. 

  

 Section 9.08 _No Right of Set-Off_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller agrees that if and to the extent any payment obligations are due and owing by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller shall not set-off against, or otherwise seek to reduce any such payment obligations by, any amounts then or thereafter payable by Newco under the Purchaser Notes or this Agreement unless, and only to the extent, that such other amounts are due and owing by Newco in accordance with the terms of the Purchaser Notes or this Agreement, as applicable, at the time of the proposed set-off. The Seller hereby waives any defense based on any such right of set-off or other right of reduction with respect to such payment obligations, and the Seller agrees not to delay the payment of any such payment obligations owed by the Seller with the primary purpose of exercising any such right of set-off.

 (d) by the Purchasers if the Seller shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured by the Termination Date as may be extended pursuant to Section 10.01(b); 

   

 (e) by the Seller if a Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured by the Termination Date as may be extended pursuant to Section 10.01(b); or 

   

 (f) by the Purchasers, if between the date hereof and the Closing, a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred, which has not been cured prior to the Termination Date.

 Section 11.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule), the Transition Services Agreement, the Parent Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchasers with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 Section 11.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned without the express written consent of the parties hereto (except by operation of law, including without limitation, the WebMD Merger, or any reorganization, consolidation or merger of Parent in which Parent is not the surviving entity); except that the Purchasers shall, prior to the Closing, assign this Agreement without the consent of the Seller or Parent to Newco, _provided_ , that such assignment shall not relieve the Purchasers of all of their obligations under this Agreement unless and until the consummation of the Closing and _provided_ , _further_ , that Newco shall have executed the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and received a cash contribution from each Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.04(d), at which point, Newco shall have assumed the Purchasers rights and obligations hereunder in full and Newco shall become responsible for the obligations assigned to it and the Purchasers shall be fully relieved of all of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to the Purchasers or a Purchaser shall apply to Newco unless the context otherwise requires. 

  

 Section 11.06 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller and the Purchasers or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 11.07. 

  

 Section 11.07 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby and, if required under applicable Law, countersigned by the other party. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 11.08 _Disclosure Schedule_. Any matter, information or item disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, under any specific representation or warranty or schedule number hereof, shall be deemed to have been disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement in response to every representation or warranty in this Agreement in respect of which such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any matter, information or item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by the Seller or any of the Companies to any third-party or otherwise imply that any such matter, information or item is material or creates a measure for materiality or Material Adverse Effect for the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.09 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied (including the provisions of Article IX relating to indemnified parties), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.10 _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in United States dollars.

All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

  

 Section 11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) certifies that no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this Section 11.12.

 Section 11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
