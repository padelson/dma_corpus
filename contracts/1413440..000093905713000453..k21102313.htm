the part of the holders thereof, each award in respect of a share of Home
Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted
under a Home Stock Plan (each a "Restricted Share") which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share interest of Cascade Common Stock as provided in Section
2.3(f)) from Cascade within ten (10) days following the Effective Time,
subject to any required Tax withholding, upon delivery by the holder thereof
to Cascade of a Restricted Share cancellation agreement in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Cascade.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Home (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Home Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
transactions described in this Section 1.5.

  

  

1.6 Incorporation Documents and Bylaws of the Surviving Company. At the

Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Company and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  

  

(b) Cascade shall take, and it shall cause Cascade Bank (as defined in Section
1.9) to take, all necessary corporate action so that, if requested in writing
by Home at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, (i) as of

Surviving Company and the Board of Directors of Cascade Bank is equal to
fourteen (14) and (ii) immediately after the Effective Time, four (4) members
of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Company and the Board of Directors
of Cascade Bank shall be persons who are members of the Board of Directors of

6  

  

 

  in such written request, which persons, subject to their eligibility,
willingness and ability to serve, shall serve until their successors are duly
elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company or Cascade Bank, as applicable, and Applicable Law.

 

  

  

1.8 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall consider that any further assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Home
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Home, and its proper officers and directors, shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Company an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law
and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to
and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Company
and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the proper
officers and directors of the Surviving Company are fully authorized in the
name of the Surviving Company or otherwise to take any and all such action
without limitation except as otherwise required by applicable law.

  

  

1.9 Bank Merger. Home Federal Bank, an Idaho chartered commercial bank and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Home, shall be merged (the "Bank Merger"), in
accordance with the applicable laws of Oregon and Idaho, with and into Bank of
the Cascades, an Oregon chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Cascade ("Cascade Bank"), immediately following the Merger, with Cascade
Bank being the resulting bank in the Bank Merger and succeeding to and
assuming all of the rights and obligations of Home Federal Bank in accordance
with the applicable laws of Oregon and Idaho. Following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Home Federal Bank shall cease. Immediately
after entering into this Agreement, Cascade Bank and Home Federal Bank will
enter into the agreement and plan of merger attached hereto as Exhibit D (the
"Bank Merger Agreement"). At the request of Cascade, Home shall cause Home
Federal Bank to execute such articles or certificates of merger and such other
documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective
("Bank Merger Certificates") immediately following the Effective Time.

  

  

1.10 Tax Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, to preserve the status of the Merger as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, if the aggregate value
of the shares of Cascade Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger (excluding the value of fractional shares for which cash is to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3(f)) based upon the closing price of the Cascade Common
Stock as reported on NASDAQ (as defined in Section 2.3(f)) on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Total Share Consideration") would
be less than 40% of the sum of the Total Cash Consideration (defined below)
and the Total Share Consideration, then the Exchange Ratio will be increased
with a corresponding decrease to the Per Share Cash Consideration so that the
Total Share Consideration is equal to 40% of the sum of the Total Share
Consideration and the Total Cash Consideration without changing the value of
the Merger Consideration under Section 1.4(b) (i.e., the aggregate value of
the Merger Consideration shall equal the Per Share Option Value both before
and after such adjustments). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Total
Cash Consideration" shall mean the sum of (i)

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

  the aggregate cash consideration to be paid in exchange for Home Common
Stock and (ii) the aggregate cash consideration to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares of Home Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 

  

  

ARTICLE II

unrelated bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Home, or Home's or
Cascade's transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement reasonably acceptable to
Home (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange

2.2 Deposit of Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Cascade shall deposit with or make available to the Exchange Agent for

2.3 Delivery of Merger Consideration.

representing shares of Home Common Stock (each a "Certificate"), (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to each Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate)) to the
Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other
provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "Letter
of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering each
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Cascade Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

  

  

(b) Within ten (10) days after surrender to the Exchange Agent of its
Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, or within five (5) business days after the Effective Time for any
uncertificated shares of Home Common Stock held of record in book-entry form
(subject to receipt of any customary tax documentation that may be reasonably
requested by the Exchange Agent), such holder of Home Common Stock will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Cascade Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in respect of the shares of Home Common Stock represented by such
holder's Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

  right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of a fractional share of Cascade Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Article II.

 

  

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Cascade Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Cascade Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless
and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article
II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole
shares of Cascade Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid
and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to shares of Cascade Common Stock
represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of the Cascade Common Stock issuable with respect to such
Certificate.

  

  

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Home
Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the stock
transfer records of Home, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Cascade Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Home Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes (as
defined in Section 3.10(b)) required by reason of the payment or issuance to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Cascade and the Exchange Agent that the Tax has been paid or
is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x)
six (6) months after the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination
of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Cascade) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of a fractional share of Cascade Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Home Common Stock such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or Cascade, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent or Cascade, as the case may be, and timely paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.4), such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Home Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Cascade, as the
case may be.

  

  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Home of the shares of Home Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Home Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

  exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Cascade Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Cascade Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Cascade Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Cascade. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Cascade shall pay to each former
shareholder of Home who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the Cascade Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a
share (after taking into account all shares of Home Common Stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Cascade Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4(b). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Cascade Average Closing
Price" means the average of the volume weighted closing price (rounded to the
nearest one ten thousandth) of Cascade Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital
Market ("NASDAQ") for the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the
tenth (10th) day prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1).

  

  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Home at the expiration of six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to Cascade. In such event, any former shareholders of Home
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Cascade with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Cascade Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share represented by a
Certificate such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Cascade, Home, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Home Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

  

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Cascade or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Cascade
or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Cascade or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(i) In the case of outstanding shares of Home Common Stock that are not
represented by Certificates, the Parties shall make such adjustments to
Article II as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose and
effect that Article II has with respect to shares of Home Common Stock that
are represented by Certificates.

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Home to
Cascade concurrently herewith (the "Home Disclosure Schedule"), provided, that
(i) no item is required to be set forth in the Home Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item in the Home Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Home that
such item represents an exception or fact, event or circumstance that is, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Home (as
defined in Section 3.1(a)), and (iii) any disclosures made in the Home
Disclosure Schedule with respect to a Section of Article III shall be deemed
to qualify (A) any other Section of Article III specifically referenced or
cross-referenced in the Home Disclosure Schedule and (B) other sections of
Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as
disclosed in any Home Reports (as defined in Section 3.12) filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") by Home since

with the Article III Standard or as otherwise provided in this paragraph. No
representation or warranty of Home contained in this Article III shall be
deemed to be untrue or incorrect, and Home shall not be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events
has had or is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 3.1(a)) on Home, without giving effect to any qualification
as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations
or warranties (the "Article III Standard"), except as set forth immediately
below. The Article III Standard shall not apply to: (x) the representations
and warranties of Home set forth in Section 3.2(a), Section 3.7, Section
3.8(a), and Section 3.24 which shall be true and correct (other than, in the
case of Section 3.2(a) to the extent such failure to be true and correct is
immaterial) in each case as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date; (y) the
representations and warranties of Home set forth in Section 3.1(b) (but only

Home set forth in Section 3.9, Section 3.10(a), Section 3.13, Section 3.26 and

3.1 Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) Home is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland, and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the "BHC Act"). Home has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets as presently owned, operated or leased and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Home is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Home. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to Cascade, Home or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, (i) a material adverse effect on the business, properties,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this
clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact
of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by Governmental Entities (as
defined in Section 3.4), (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that
are taken with the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) a decline in the trading price of
a party's common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections, it being understood that the underlying causes for such decline
or failure may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Material Adverse Effect, (F) changes in the value of the securities or loan
portfolio, or changes in the value of the deposits or borrowings, of such
party or its Subsidiaries, resulting from a change in interest rates
generally, except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C), or (F) to the
extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately
adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate), (ii) in the case of Home, any event or
occurrence, including the Merger or the Bank Merger, that results in or is
reasonably likely to result in the loss of any material amount of loss share
coverage from the FDIC, as Receiver, under any shared-loss agreements between
Home Federal Bank and the FDIC, as Receiver (each a "Shared-Loss Agreement"),
or (iii) a material adverse effect on the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of
the articles of incorporation of Home (the "Home Articles") and the bylaws of
Home (the "Home Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by Home to Cascade.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Home (a "Home Subsidiary") (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Home and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
its properties and assets as presently owned, operated or leased and to carry
on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of
any Subsidiary of Home to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case
of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Home that is an insured depository institution
are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and, to the knowledge of Home,
no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or
threatened. Home's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December
31, 2012 includes a true and complete list of all Significant Subsidiaries of
Home, as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under
the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 3.6(c)), as of the date hereof. True
and complete copies of the organization and governing documents of each such
Significant Subsidiary, as in effect as of the date hereof, have been
previously made available by Home to Cascade.

  

  

3.2 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Home currently consists of 90,000,000
shares of Home Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of serial preferred stock,
par value $0.01 per share. As of the date hereof, there were (i) 16,872,452

Restricted Shares and net of shares held in treasury shall not exceed
14,522,196 plus the number of shares that may be issued after the date hereof
in connection with the exercise of Home Stock Options outstanding on the date
hereof. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Home Common Stock have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
that have the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Home may
vote. No trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of Home or any of its
Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding. Other than Home Stock Options
outstanding on the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other commitments or agreements obligating Home to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or other securities. To the knowledge of Home, there are no
voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Home Common Stock or other
equity interests of Home or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

  its Subsidiaries. Section 3.2(a) of the Home Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all Home Stock Options and
Restricted Shares outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-
by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder, (ii) the number of shares
subject to each such Home Stock Option, (iii) the number of Restricted Shares,
(iv) the grant date of each such Home Stock Option and Restricted Share and
(v) the exercise price for each such Home Stock Option. Other than the Home
Stock Options and Restricted Shares, no equity-based awards (including any
cash awards where the amount of payment is determined in whole or in part
based on the price of any capital stock of Home or any of its Subsidiaries)
are outstanding.

 

  

  

(b) Home owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Home Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances
and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable (except, with respect to Home Federal Bank, as provided under
applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Home Subsidiary has or is
bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other security of such Subsidiary.

  

  

(c) Home does not have a dividend reinvestment plan or any shareholders'
rights plan.

  

  

3.3 Authority; No Violation.

  

  

(a) Home has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Home.
The Board of Directors of Home has determined that the Merger, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is advisable and in the best
interests of Home and its shareholders and has directed that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to Home's shareholders
for approval at a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to
the foregoing effect. Except for the approval of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Home Common Stock (the "Requisite Home Vote") and the adoption and approval of
the Bank Merger Agreement by Home as the sole shareholder of Home Federal
Bank, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Home or any Home
Subsidiary are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Home and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Cascade) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Home,
enforceable against Home in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as
such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions (as
defined in Section 3.16)).

  

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Home nor the
consummation by Home or any Home Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Home or any Home Subsidiary with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

  (i) violate any provision of the Home Articles, the Home Bylaws or the
organization or governing documents of any Home Subsidiary or (ii) assuming
that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are duly obtained,
(x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
writ, decree or injunction applicable to Home, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result

default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Home or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Home Default") under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Home or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Home.

 

  

  

(c) The Board of Directors of Home Federal Bank has adopted the Bank Merger
Agreement, Home, as the sole shareholder of Home Federal Bank, shall promptly
hereafter approve the Bank Merger Agreement, and the Bank Merger Agreement
will be duly executed by Home Federal Bank on the date of this Agreement.

execution and delivery by Home of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by
Home of the Merger and the consummation by Home or any Home Subsidiary of the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank Merger). As of the

approvals and consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of
the Merger and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 

  

  

3.5 Reports. Home and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports,

all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where
the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees
and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Home. Except for normal
examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of Home and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or
has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Home, investigation into
the business or operations of Home or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1,
2010, except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Home. There (x) is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception
by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any written report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of Home or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (y) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Home or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010, in each case, which would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Home.

(a) The financial statements of Home and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Home Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of Home and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes
in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Home and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates

  the notes thereto. The books and records of Home and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Home
that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants
of Home as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Home on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

 

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Home, neither Home nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for
those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Home included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2013, or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Home and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Home or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Home. Home (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) to ensure that material information
relating to Home, including its Subsidiaries, is accumulated and communicated
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Home by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Home's outside auditors and the audit
committee of Home's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect Home's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Home's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to Home's auditors and audit committee and
a copy has previously been made available to Cascade. There is no reason to
believe that Home's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

  

  

(d) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of Home, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Home or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

  auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Home
or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Home or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Home or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Home or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by Home or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of Home or any committee thereof or to the
knowledge of Home, to any director or officer of Home.

 

  

  

3.7 Broker's Fees. With the exception of the engagement of Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc. related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder, neither Home nor any Home Subsidiary nor any of their respective
officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or
incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in
connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Home has disclosed to Cascade as of the date hereof the aggregate
fees provided for in connection with the engagement by Home of Keefe, Bruyette
and Woods, Inc. related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder.

  

  

3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  

  

(a) Since December 31, 2012, no event or events (including Actions (as defined
in Section 3.9(a)) have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Home.

  

  

(b) Since December 31, 2012, to the date hereof, other than entering into this
Agreement or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, Home and its Subsidiaries have carried on their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business.

  

  

(c) Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action since
September 30, 2013, that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would
constitute a breach of any of the covenants of Home contained in Section 5.2.

  

  

3.9 Legal Proceedings.

  

  

(a) There is no material action, suit, claim, arbitration, investigation,
inquiry, grievance or other proceeding (each, an "Action") (or basis therefor)
pending or, to the knowledge of Home, threatened against or affecting Home or
any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or any of their
respective assets. Since January 1, 2010, (i) there have been no subpoenas,
written demands or document requests received by Home or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity, except such as are received by Home
or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or as are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Home taken as a whole, and (ii)
no Governmental Entity has requested that Home or any of its Subsidiaries
enter into a settlement negotiation or tolling agreement with respect to any
matter related to any such subpoena, written demand or document request.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Home, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets or
properties of Home or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of
the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Company or any of its affiliates).

  

  

3.10 Taxes and Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) Each of Home and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns that were required
to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all material respects. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary
course of business). All material Taxes of Home and its Subsidiaries (whether
or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid
other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of
Home or its Subsidiaries or which Home and/or its Subsidiaries is contesting
in good faith. Each of Home and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent
contractor or other third party. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Home
and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2008 have been examined by
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or are Tax Returns with respect to
which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving
effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. Neither Home nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of assessment or proposed assessment
in connection with any Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or
pending disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding
any Tax of Home and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Home and its
Subsidiaries. Home has made available to Cascade true and complete copies of
any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6)
years. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Home and
its Subsidiaries). Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Home) or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Home or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of
related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of
which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a
distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a listed transaction within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) (or any predecessor provision), and neither Home nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been notified of, or to the knowledge of Home or
its Subsidiaries has participated in, a transaction that is described as a
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five (5) years has Home been a
United States

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

  real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2)
of the Code. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Home or any of
its Subsidiaries other than Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.
As of the date hereof, neither Home nor its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any
conditions which exist or which may fail to exist that might prevent or impede
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. No claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity in
a jurisdiction where Home or a Home Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that
Home or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed an election under Section
338(g) or 338(h)(10) of the Code. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has
agreed, nor is it required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the
Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise that will affect
its liability for Taxes.

 

  

  

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal,
state, local and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem, profits,
gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license, payroll, employment,
social security, severance, unemployment, withholding, duties, excise,
windfall profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, value added,
alternative or add-on minimum, estimated and other taxes, charges, levies or
like assessments together with all penalties and additions to tax and interest

correct and complete list of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option,
stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, health,
disability or life insurance, supplemental retirement, salary continuation and
other welfare and benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all retention,
bonus, employment, termination, severance and change in control plans,
programs, arrangements, contracts and agreements to or with respect to which
Home or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of Home or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with Home
would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of
ERISA (a "Home ERISA Affiliate"), is a party or has any current or future
obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Home or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Home ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current
or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Home or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Home ERISA Affiliate (all such plans, programs,
arrangements, contracts or agreements, collectively, the "Home Benefit
Plans").

  

  

(b) Home has heretofore made available to Cascade true and complete copies of
each of the Home Benefit Plans and certain related documents, including, but
not limited to, (i) all summary plan descriptions, amendments, modifications
or material supplements to any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

  Home Benefit Plan, (ii) the annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with
the IRS for the last two (2) plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS
determination letter, if any, relating to a Home Benefit Plan, and (iv) the
most recently prepared actuarial report for each Home Benefit Plan (if
applicable) for each of the last two (2) years.

 

  

  

(c) Each Home Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither Home nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing
under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, United States Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Home Benefit Plan,
and neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan
defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.

  

  

(d) Home has previously made available to Cascade each Home Benefit Plan that
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each a "Home
Qualified Plan"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each Home Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has
not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge
of Home, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any Home Qualified Plan or the
related trust or increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding of any
Home Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code.

  

  

(e) Each Home Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award thereunder, in
each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January
1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since
January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(f) No Home Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA.

time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two
(2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
Employer Plan"), and none of Home and its Subsidiaries nor any Home ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms
are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the Home Disclosure Schedule,
neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Home Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Home Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely
made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or
before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of
Home.

  

  

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course of business) or other Actions which have been asserted
or instituted, and, to Home's knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which
may reasonably give rise to any Action against the Home Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Home Benefit Plans or
the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Home Benefit Plans which
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Home or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity, any Multiemployer Plan, a
Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Home Benefit Plan, or any other
party.

  

  

(k) None of Home and its Subsidiaries nor any Home ERISA Affiliate nor any
other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Home Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Home, any of its Subsidiaries, any Home ERISA Affiliate or any person that
Home or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

  

  

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of Home or any of
its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of Home or any of
its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Home Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or
in the form of benefits) by Home or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as
a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or
will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither Home nor any
of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require Home or any of its affiliates to establish or make any
contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle. No Home Benefit Plan
provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A
of the Code, or otherwise. Home has made available to Cascade true, correct
and complete copies of estimated Section 280G calculations (whether or not
final) with respect to any disqualified individual in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(m) There are no pending or, to Home's knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against Home or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes
against Home or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Home nor any of its
Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

  bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules
or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee association
applicable to employees of Home or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of Home, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group
seeking to represent any employees of Home or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

  

  

3.12 SEC Reports. As of their respective filing dates, no Home Report (and, in
the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively) contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Home Reports" means each
final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive
proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by Home pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act

respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Home has
failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised
by the SEC with respect to any of the Home Reports.

and has at all times since December 31, 2010, held, all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights and
assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure
to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit
or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Home, and to the knowledge of Home no suspension or
cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization
is threatened. Home and each of its Subsidiaries complies, and has complied at
all times since December 31, 2010, in all material respects with and is not in

"Home Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Home or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2010, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any
such Home Regulatory Agreement.

  

  

3.16 Risk Management Instruments. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar derivative
transactions and risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the
account of Home, any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of
Home or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of
business and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of
the applicable Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Home or one of its Subsidiaries

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

  enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies
(the "Enforceability Exceptions")), and are in full force and effect. Home and
each of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued, and, to Home's knowledge, there are no material
breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any
party thereunder.

 

  

  

3.17 Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Home,
Home and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with any federal, state or local

threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or (c) noise,

private environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition, on Home or any of its Subsidiaries of
any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law, pending or,
to the knowledge of Home, threatened (in writing issued to Home or its
Subsidiaries) against Home or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Home. To the knowledge of Home, there
is no reasonable basis at this time to conclude that any Actions referenced in
the preceding sentence will impose any liability or obligation that would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Home. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Home nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any written agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of agreement by or with any
court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing.

its Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
Home in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

  

  

(b) Home and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ

procedures.

26  

  

 

  owned by Home or a Home Subsidiary or acquired after the date thereof
(except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business) (the "Home Owned Properties"), free and clear of
all Liens, except (i) as noted in the latest balance sheet included in the
Home Reports, (ii) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (iii) Liens
for real property Taxes not yet due and payable or being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been

and other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value or use
of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise
materially impair business operations at such properties and (v) such
imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially affect
the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected
thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties
(collectively, "Permitted Encumbrances"), and (b) is the lessee of all
leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial statements
included in such Home Reports (except for leases that have expired by their

possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and to Home's
knowledge each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the lessee or
the lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Home, threatened
condemnation proceedings against the Home Real Property.

 

  

  

3.20 Intellectual Property. Home and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens), all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Home: (a) (i) the use of any
Intellectual Property by Home and its Subsidiaries does not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights of any person and is in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Home or any Home
Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property, and (ii) no
person has asserted in writing to Home or any of its Subsidiaries that Home or
any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated
the Intellectual Property rights of such person, (b) to Home's knowledge, no
person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of Home

and/or licensed to Home or its Subsidiaries, and (c) neither Home nor any Home
Subsidiary has received any written notice of any pending claim with respect
to any Intellectual Property owned by Home or any Home Subsidiary, and Home

owned or licensed, respectively, by Home and its Subsidiaries necessary for

related transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are
there any currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions in
excess of one hundred twenty thousand dollars ($120,000), between Home or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director or
"executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Home
or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who beneficially owns (calculated in
accordance with Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5% or more of the

members or affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of Home) on the other hand,

generally or those related to compensation solely resulting from an employment
relationship.

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required to render
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
Sections 3-601 through 3-605 of the MGCL and any similar "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," "takeover" or "interested stockholder" law (any
such laws, "Takeover Statutes").

  

  

3.23 Reorganization. Neither Home nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action and Home is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably
be expected to prevent either the Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

3.24 Opinion. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Home has received the
oral opinion (to be confirmed in writing) from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.,

matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial
point of view to the shareholders of Home. Such opinion has not been amended
or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

3.25 Home Information. The information relating to Home and its Subsidiaries
that is provided by Home or its representatives for inclusion in the Joint
Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document filed with any other
Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for such portions

continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are exempt therefrom.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29

ARTICLE IV

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CASCADE

  

  

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Cascade to
Home concurrently herewith (the "Cascade Disclosure Schedule"), provided, that
(i) no item is required to be set forth in the Cascade Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result
in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect,
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Cascade Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
Cascade that such item represents an exception or fact, event or circumstance
that is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
Cascade, and (iii) any disclosures made in the Cascade Disclosure Schedule
with respect to a Section of Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (A) any
other Section of Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced in the
Cascade Disclosure Schedule and (B) other sections of Article IV to the extent
it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Cascade
Reports (as defined in Section 4.12) filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Cascade since December 31, 2010 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding

or any other statements that are similarly nonspecific or cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature), Cascade hereby represents and
warrants to Home that the representations and warranties contained in this

case in accordance with the Article IV Standard or as otherwise provided in
this paragraph. No representation or warranty of Cascade contained in this
Article IV shall be deemed to be untrue or incorrect, and Cascade shall not be
deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the
existence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or
event, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or
events has had or is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Cascade, without giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or warranties (the
"Article IV Standard"), except as set forth immediately below. The Article IV
Standard shall not apply to: (x) the representations and warranties of Cascade
set forth in Section 4.2(a), Section 4.7 and Section 4.8(a), which shall be
true and correct (other than, in the case of Section 4.2(a), to the extent
such failure to be true and correct is immaterial) in each case as of the date
of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date and (y) the representations and warranties of
Cascade set forth in Section 4.1(b) (but only with respect to the banking

4.1 Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) Cascade is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Oregon, and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act. Cascade has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets as presently owned,
operated or leased and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cascade. True and complete
copies of the articles of incorporation of Cascade (the "Cascade Articles")
and bylaws of Cascade (the "Cascade Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by Cascade to Home.

  

  

(b) Each Subsidiary of Cascade (a "Cascade Subsidiary" or a "Subsidiary of
Cascade") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cascade, and (iii) has all
requisite corporate or entity power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets as presently owned, operated or leased and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Cascade to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of
a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit
accounts of each Subsidiary of Cascade that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and to the knowledge of
Cascade, no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or
threatened. Cascade's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2012 includes a true and complete list of all Significant Subsidiaries of
Cascade, as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated

in effect as of the date hereof, have been previously made available by
Cascade to Home.

the issued and outstanding shares of Cascade Common Stock have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have

knowledge of Cascade, there are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements,

is currently deferring interest payments with respect to any trust preferred
securities or related debentures issued by it or any of its affiliates.

 

  

  

(b) Cascade owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Cascade Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares or
equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank Subsidiaries, as
provided under applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Cascade Subsidiary
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other security of such Subsidiary.

  

  

4.3 Authority; No Violation.

  

  

(a) Cascade has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of
Cascade. The Board of Directors of Cascade has determined that the Merger, on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is advisable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

  and in the best interests of Cascade and its shareholders and has directed
that the issuance of shares of Cascade Common Stock contemplated by this
Agreement be submitted to Cascade's shareholders for approval at a meeting of
such shareholders. Except for the approval of the issuance of Cascade Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement by a majority of the votes cast by holders of
Cascade Common Stock (the "Requisite Cascade Vote") and the adoption and
approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by Cascade as the sole shareholder of
Cascade Bank, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Cascade or any
Cascade Subsidiary are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Cascade and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Home) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Cascade,
enforceable against Cascade in accordance with its terms (except in all cases
as such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).
Subject to obtaining the Requisite Cascade Vote, the Cascade Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger, has been (or will be) validly authorized, when
issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no current
or past shareholder of Cascade will have any preemptive right or similar
rights in respect thereof.

 

  

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cascade, nor the
consummation by Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Cascade or any Cascade Subsidiary with
any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the

a Material Adverse Effect on Cascade.

  

  

4.6 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The financial statements of Cascade and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Cascade Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Cascade and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position of

other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. BDO USA, LLP has not resigned (or informed Cascade that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Cascade as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Cascade on
a

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Cascade, as of the date hereof,
neither Cascade nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Cascade included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013 (including any
notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Cascade and its

(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Cascade or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Cascade. Cascade (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Cascade, including its
Subsidiaries, is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer
and the chief financial officer of Cascade by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Cascade's outside auditors and the
audit committee of Cascade's Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal

Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Cascade's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Cascade's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Cascade's
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to
Home. There is no reason to believe that Cascade's outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Cascade or any of its

finder's fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  other third party. Neither Cascade nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted

under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or
otherwise that will affect its liability for Taxes.

has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Cascade, there are
no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely
affect the qualified status of any Cascade Qualified Plan or the related trust

the books and records of Cascade.

 

  

  

(h) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course of business) or other Actions which have been asserted
or instituted, and, to Cascade's knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably give rise to any Action against the Cascade Benefit
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Cascade

threatened against Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or
obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the

Cascade in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

  

  

(b) Cascade and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures that Cascade believes are prudent and reasonable in
the context of such businesses. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Cascade
has made available to Home the material terms of such policies, practices and
procedures.

  

  

4.18 Real Property. Cascade or a Cascade Subsidiary (a) has good title to all
the real property reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in
the Cascade Reports as being owned by Cascade or a Cascade Subsidiary or
acquired after the date thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed
of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business) (the "Cascade
Owned Properties"), free and clear of all material Liens, except for Permitted
Encumbrances (substituting for purposes hereof Cascade Reports for Home
Reports), and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the
latest audited financial statements included in such Cascade Reports or
acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that have expired by their
terms since the date thereof) (the "Cascade Leased Properties" and,
collectively with the Cascade Owned Properties, the "Cascade Real Property"),
free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Encumbrances (substituting for purposes hereof Cascade Reports for Home
Reports), and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased
thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to Cascade's knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Cascade, threatened condemnation proceedings against the Cascade
Real Property.

  

  

4.19 Intellectual Property. Cascade and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any material Liens), all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Cascade: (a) (i) the use of any
Intellectual Property by Cascade and its Subsidiaries does not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate the rights of any person and is in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which Cascade or any
Cascade Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property, and
(ii) no person has asserted in writing to Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries
that Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of such person, (b) to
Cascade's knowledge, no person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise
violating any right of Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to Cascade or its Subsidiaries,
and (c) neither Cascade nor any Cascade Subsidiary has received any written
notice of any pending

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

  claim with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by Cascade or any
Cascade Subsidiary, and Cascade and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable actions to avoid the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability
of all Intellectual Property owned or licensed, respectively, by Cascade and
its Subsidiaries necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted.

 

  

  

4.20 Related Party Transactions. There are no transactions or series of
related transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are
there any currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions,
between Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current
or former director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) of Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who
beneficially owns (calculated in accordance with Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the
Exchange Act) 5% or more of the outstanding Cascade Common Stock (or any of
such person's immediate family members or affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries
of Cascade), on the other hand, except those of a type available to employees
of Cascade or its Subsidiaries generally or those related to compensation
solely resulting from an employment relationship.

  

  

4.21 Reorganization. Neither Cascade nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action and Cascade is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to prevent either the Merger or the Bank Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  

  

4.22 Cascade Information. The information relating to Cascade and its
Subsidiaries to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the S-4, and the
information relating to Cascade and its Subsidiaries that is provided by
Cascade or its representatives for inclusion in any other document filed with
any other Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
are made, not misleading. The S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement (except for such
portions thereof that relate only to Home or any of its Subsidiaries) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
Exchange Act, respectively, and the rules and regulations thereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, Cascade shall have no responsibility for the truth or
accuracy of any information with respect to Home or any of its Subsidiaries
contained in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement or in any document submitted
to, or other communication with, any Regulatory Agency.

continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are exempt therefrom.

  

  

(e) Neither Cascade nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been

Effective Time any event occurs or information relating to Home or Cascade, or
any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by Home or Cascade that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to either the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

  document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to

the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law,
disseminated to Home's shareholders.

 

  

  

(b) In addition to their obligations pursuant to Section 6.1(a), Cascade shall
make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities Act, the

of (and provide copies of any notices or communications with respect to) the
time of the effectiveness of the S-4, the filing of any supplement or
amendment thereto, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto, the
suspension of the qualification of Cascade Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement or the S-4,
comments thereon from the SEC's staff and each party's responses thereto or
request of the SEC or its staff for additional information. No amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the S-4 shall be filed without the

necessary actions or no-actions, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods under the HSR Act or other antitrust laws, waivers, consents,

Regulatory Agencies or other Governmental Entities and the taking of all
commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain expirations or
terminations of waiting periods under the HSR Act or other antitrust laws, an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger, the
Bank Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Parties
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to prepare and file, all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties, Regulatory Agencies and other Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. In
furtherance (but not in limitation) of the foregoing, Cascade shall, and shall
cause Cascade Bank to, use

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

  commercially reasonable efforts to file any required applications, notices
or other filings with the Federal Reserve Board, the Idaho Department, the
Oregon Division and the FDIC within forty-five (45) days after the date
hereof. Home and Cascade shall have the right to review in advance, and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the
information relating to Home or Cascade, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party, Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties shall consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies, and other
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

  

  

(d) Each of Cascade and Home shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Cascade, Home
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Each of Cascade and Home shall promptly advise the other upon receiving
any communication from any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity the
consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed,
or that any such approval may contain an Unduly Burdensome Condition (as
defined in Section 7.2(e)).

  

  

6.2 Access to Information; Current Information; Attendance at Meetings.

  

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each of Home and Cascade shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of the other
party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such Party shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other Party all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
other Party may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, but
subject to the other terms of this Section 6.2(a), Home shall consult with
Cascade, and allow Cascade the opportunity to reasonably participate in, at
Cascade's cost, and keep Cascade reasonably informed with respect to, any
litigation brought by any shareholders of Home against Home or any of its
directors or officers. Home shall also provide the officers of Cascade and/or
Cascade Bank with access to the personnel of Home Federal Bank relating to
post-Merger duties, responsibilities and potential contractual arrangements to
be effective on or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

  after the Effective Time. Neither Home nor Cascade, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information (i) where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) relating to its
board's, officers', employees', agents', investment bankers', or financial
advisers' consideration or deliberation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or, in the case of Home, except as expressly required herein, an
Acquisition Proposal. The Parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of part (i) of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms herein, Home shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit, Cascade and/or an environmental consulting firm
selected by Cascade, at the sole expense of Cascade, to conduct such Phase I
and/or Phase II environmental audits, studies and tests on real property
currently owned, leased or operated by Home or any of its Subsidiaries. In the
event any subsurface or Phase II site assessments are conducted (which
assessments shall be at Cascade's sole expense), Cascade shall (a) indemnify
Home and its Subsidiaries for all costs and expenses associated with all
damages, including but not limited to personal injury and property damage
(including but not limited to returning the property to its condition prior to
the Phase II) arising from or related to such assessments, (b) obtain and
maintain itself, or cause all contractors who perform such assessments to
obtain and maintain, insurance in coverage types and amounts, and by insurance
carriers, reasonably acceptable to Home, and shall provide certificates of
such insurance to Home at least ten (10) days before commencing such work, and
(c) deliver to Home, no later than fifteen (15) days before commencing any and
all such assessment work, a workplan prepared by the consultant who will
perform the assessment work, which workplan shall identify details of the
proposed assessment work to be conducted on behalf of Cascade, and which
workplan shall be subject to review and approval by Home, prior to the
commencement of any such assessment work, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(c) Subject to applicable law and regulations, during the period from the date
hereof to the Effective Time, Home shall, upon the request of Cascade, cause
one or more of its designated officers to confer on a monthly basis (or more
frequently if the Parties reasonably agree that it is necessary) with officers
of Cascade regarding the financial condition, operations and business of Home
and its Subsidiaries and matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably available,
but in no event more than five (5) business days after filing, Home will
deliver to Cascade all reports filed by it or any of its Subsidiaries with any
Regulatory Agency or other Government Entity subsequent to the date hereof,
including all financial and call reports filed with the Federal Reserve Board,
the FDIC and the Idaho Department. Home will also deliver to Cascade as soon
as practicable all quarterly and annual financial statements of Home and its
Subsidiaries prepared with respect to periods ending subsequent to June 30,
2013. As soon as practicable after the end of each month, Home will deliver to
Cascade in electronic form (i) the monthly deposit and loan trial balances of
Home Federal Bank, (ii) the monthly analysis of Home Federal Bank's investment
portfolio and (iii) monthly balance sheet and income statement of Home and its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(d) The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Cascade or
Cascade Bank or either of their designees (not to exceed one (1) person in the
aggregate at any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

  meeting) shall be invited and entitled to attend all meetings of the Home
Board of Directors and the board of directors of Home Federal Bank (and loan
and executive committee meetings); provided, however, such individuals (i)
will attend such meetings in an observational capacity only and shall not
participate in any deliberations or decisions of such boards or committees,
(ii) shall be excluded from any portions of such meetings involving (A)
discussion relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) matters for which the inclusion of such individuals
would or could reasonably be expected to violate applicable law, regulation or
orders, decrees or determinations of a Government Entity, or (C) discussions
relating to matters which are otherwise reasonably deemed by the Home Board of
Directors to be confidential (together, "Home Board Confidential Matters").
Board packages and notices shall be submitted by Home and Home Federal Bank to
the Chief Executive Officer of Cascade for distribution to Cascade's
designated attendees simultaneously with their submission to board members;
provided information relating to Home Board Confidential Matters may be
excluded therefrom. The Chief Credit Officer of Cascade Bank or his designee
shall be invited and entitled to attend all recurring credit related meetings
of Home Federal Bank; provided, however, such individual will attend such
meetings in an observational capacity only and shall not participate in any
deliberations or decisions.

 

  

  

(e) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Parties as of September 25, 2013 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

  

  

(f) No investigation by a Party or its representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other Party set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

6.3 Shareholder Meeting.

  

  

(a) Home shall, and shall cause its Board of Directors to, (i) take all action
in accordance with the federal securities laws, the laws of the State of
Maryland and the Home Articles and Home Bylaws necessary to (A) call and give
notice of a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Home Shareholder
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Home Vote within ten (10)
days following the date the S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
(the "Notice Date") and (B) schedule the Home Shareholder Meeting to take
place on a date that is within forty-five (45) days after the Notice Date;
(ii) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (x) cause the Home
Shareholder Meeting to be convened and held on the scheduled date and (y)
obtain the Requisite Home Vote; and (iii) subject to Section 6.8, include in
the Proxy Statement the recommendation that the Home shareholders approve this
Agreement and the Merger (the "Home Board Recommendation"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Home shall not be
required to hold the Home Shareholder Meeting if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1 prior to the scheduled time of the Home Shareholder
Meeting.

  

  

(b) Cascade shall, and shall cause its Board of Directors to, (i) take all
action in accordance with the federal securities laws, the laws of the State
of Oregon and the Cascade Articles and Cascade Bylaws necessary to (A) call
and give notice of a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Cascade
Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Cascade Vote
within ten (10) days following the Notice Date and (B) schedule the Cascade

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

  Shareholder Meeting to take place on a date that is within forty-five (45)
days after the Notice Date; (ii) use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to (x) cause the Cascade Shareholder Meeting to be convened and held on the
scheduled date and (y) obtain the Requisite Cascade Vote; and (iii) subject to
this 6.3(b), include in the Cascade Proxy Statement the recommendation that
the Cascade shareholders approve the issuance of Cascade Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement (the "Cascade Board Recommendation"). The Board of Directors
of Cascade shall not (nor shall any committee thereof) withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to Home, the Cascade Board Recommendation or make or cause to
be made any third party or public communication proposing or announcing an
intention to withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Home the Cascade
Board Recommendation (any such action, a "Cascade Change in Recommendation").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Cascade (including
any committee thereof) may, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Cascade Vote, effect a Cascade Change in Recommendation if the Board of
Directors of Cascade (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with counsel) that the failure to make a Cascade Change in
Recommendation would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Cascade (or
applicable committee thereof) may not make a Cascade Change in Recommendation
until at least four (4) business days following Home's initial receipt of
written notice that the Board of Directors of Cascade (or applicable committee
thereof) intends to make such Cascade Change in Recommendation and the reasons
therefor, and, taking into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Home, the Board of Directors of Cascade (or applicable
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with counsel)
that the failure to make a Cascade Change in Recommendation would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cascade shall not be
required to hold the Cascade Shareholder Meeting if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 prior to the scheduled time of the Cascade
Shareholder Meeting.

 

  

  

6.4 Reservation of Common Stock; NASDAQ Listing.

  

  

(a) Cascade agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the
Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of
shares of Cascade Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Cascade shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Cascade Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Home Common
Stock in the Merger to be authorized for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

6.5 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Following the Effective Time, Cascade shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees (as a group) who are full-time employees of Home and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee
benefits and compensation programs which, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits and compensation programs that are made
available on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

  employees of Cascade or its Subsidiaries (other than Home and its
Subsidiaries), as applicable; provided that (i) in no event shall any Covered
Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Cascade or
its Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as Cascade shall cause Covered
Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation opportunities
that are made available to similarly situated employees of Cascade or its
Subsidiaries (other than Home and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employee's
continued participation in employee benefit plans and compensation programs of
Home and its Subsidiaries that are continued by Cascade or a Cascade
Subsidiary shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
sentence (it being understood that participation in the Cascade Benefit Plans
may commence at different times with respect to each Cascade Benefit Plan).

 

  

  

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Cascade Benefit Plan, Cascade shall cause such Cascade Benefit Plan to (i)
recognize full-time years of prior service from the date of most recent hire
of such Covered Employee with Home or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under any plan that determines
benefits on an actuarial basis, for benefit accrual, but only to the extent
that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under
a comparable Home Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service; and (ii) with
respect to any Cascade Benefit Plan that is a health, dental, vision plan or
other similar plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate
for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate, Cascade or its applicable Subsidiary shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such Cascade or Subsidiary plan to be waived
with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such condition was or
would have been covered under the Home Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
recognize any health, dental, vision or other similar expenses incurred by
such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental, vision or other
welfare plan.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Home shall take, and cause its Subsidiaries
to take, all actions necessary or appropriate to cause the Home Federal Bank
401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "Home KSOP") to be terminated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such actions shall include amending
the Home KSOP to allocate any excess amounts in the Unallocated Reserve (as
defined in the Home KSOP) that may exist after consummation of the Merger.
Upon termination of the Home KSOP, all affected participants shall become
fully vested in their accounts under the Home KSOP determined in accordance
with the terms of the Home KSOP and applicable law. As soon as reasonably
practicable (but no later than thirty (30) days) after the Effective Time,
Cascade shall apply for and use reasonable best efforts to obtain a favorable
determination letter from the IRS that the termination of the Home KSOP does
not adversely affect the tax qualified status of the Home KSOP under Section
401(a) of the Code (the "Final Determination Letter"). As soon as reasonably
practicable, Home shall cooperate with Cascade as reasonably necessary for
Cascade to timely apply for the determination letter in accordance with the
preceding sentence. As soon as practicable after receipt of such Final
Determination Letter, distribution of benefits under the Home KSOP shall be
made to the Home

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

  KSOP participants in compliance with the terms of the Home KSOP and the
Final Determination Letter.

 

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Home shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by Cascade that may be necessary
or appropriate to (i) cause the continuation on and after the Effective Time
of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to any Home Benefit
Plan for such period as may be requested by Cascade, or (ii) facilitate the
merger of any Home Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by
Cascade or a Cascade Subsidiary. All resolutions, notices, or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
Section 6.5(d) shall be subject to Cascade's prior review and approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, Cascade shall, or it shall cause Cascade Bank to,
assume and honor the post-Effective Time obligations of Home and/or its
Subsidiaries under (i) the Home General Severance Plan, (ii) each Home
Deferred Compensation Plan and (iii) each Home Change in Control Agreement.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of
Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, any
Home Subsidiary) to amend or terminate any Home Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan. Nor shall anything in this Section 6.5 be
construed to require Cascade or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following
the Closing Date, any Home Subsidiary) to retain the employment of any
particular Covered Employee for any period of time following the Closing Date.

  

  

6.6 Officers' and Directors' Insurance; Indemnification.

  

  

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Cascade shall
maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance covering the persons who
are presently covered by Home's current officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy with respect to actions, omissions, events, matters or
circumstances occurring prior to the Effective Time, on terms which are at
least substantially equivalent to the terms of said current policy and with an
insurance carrier reasonably acceptable to Home, provided that it shall not be
required to expend in the aggregate during the coverage period more than an
amount equal to 200% of the annual premium most recently paid by Home (the
"Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto,
and further provided that if Cascade is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 6.6(a), Cascade shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount which may be in the form of tail coverage, or may
request Home to obtain such tail coverage at Cascade's expense prior to the
Closing Date; provided, further, that officers and directors of Home or its
Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to Cascade's insurance carrier for the purpose
of obtaining such insurance.

  

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Date, Cascade
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain and preserve the rights
to indemnification of Home's and its Subsidiaries' officers, employees,
directors and agents to the maximum extent

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

  permitted by any of the Home Articles, Home Bylaws, the governing
documents of Home's applicable Significant Subsidiaries, and applicable law
with respect to indemnification for liabilities and claims arising out of
acts, omissions, events, matters or circumstances occurring or existing prior
to the Effective Time, including the Merger, to the extent such rights to
indemnification are not in excess of that permitted by applicable state or
federal laws or Regulatory Agencies.

 

  

  

(c) In connection with the indemnification provided pursuant to Section
6.6(b), Cascade and/or a Cascade Subsidiary (i) will advance expenses,
promptly after statements therefor are received, to each such indemnified
person to the fullest extent permitted by law and Regulatory Agencies
(provided the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such individual is
not entitled to indemnification), including the payment of the fees and
expenses of one counsel with respect to a matter, and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction, if necessary or appropriate, selected by such
indemnified person or multiple indemnified persons, it being understood that
they collectively shall only be entitled to one counsel and one local counsel
in each applicable jurisdiction where necessary or appropriate (unless a
conflict shall exist between them in which case they may retain separate
counsel), all such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Cascade and
(ii) will cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

  

(d) This Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
each indemnified person (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce this
Section against Cascade from and after the Effective Time), and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Cascade.

  

  

(e) In the event Cascade or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or more other
persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Cascade assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.

  

  

6.7 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Home and Cascade agree that,
in order to most effectively compensate and retain Home Insiders, both prior
to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Home Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Home Common Stock into shares of Cascade Common Stock in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the
provisions of this Section 6.7. Assuming Home delivers to Cascade in a
reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information
regarding those officers and directors of Home subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "Home Insiders"), the
Board of Directors of Cascade and of Home, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Home Common Stock and Restricted Shares by the Home
Insiders, and any acquisitions of Cascade Common Stock, or the stock issued
pursuant to Section 1.4, by any Home Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  

  

6.8 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Home agrees that, except as expressly permitted by Section 6.8(b), from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, it will not, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
and employees (the "Home Individuals") not to, and will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause Home's and its Subsidiaries' agents, advisors
and controlled affiliates, accountants, legal counsel and financial advisors
(the "Home Representatives") not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data concerning its and/or its Subsidiaries business,
properties or assets ("Home Confidential Information") to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.8(a), at any time
from the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Requisite Home
Vote, in the event Home receives a written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
(as defined in Section 6.8(e)) and the Board of Directors of Home determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
Home may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and the Home Individuals and the
Home Representatives to, (i) negotiate the terms of, and enter into, a
confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions no less favorable to Home
than the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"), (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished Home Confidential
Information to the person or persons making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii) negotiate and
participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person or persons
making such Acquisition Proposal concerning such Acquisition Proposal, if the
Board of Directors of Home determines in good faith (following consultation
with counsel) that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

  

  

(c) The Board of Directors of Home shall not (nor shall any committee thereof)
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Cascade, the Home Board
Recommendation or make or cause to be made any third party or public
communication proposing or announcing an intention to withdraw or modify in
any manner adverse to Cascade the Home Board Recommendation (any such action,
a "Change in Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of Home (including any committee thereof) may, at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Home Vote, effect a Change in Recommendation in
response to a bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement that the Board of Directors of Home determines in
good faith (after consultation with counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Home may not make a Change
in Recommendation, or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until it has given Cascade at least
four (4) business days, following Cascade's initial receipt of written notice
that the Board of Directors of Home (or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

  applicable committee thereof) has determined that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and the reasons therefor, to respond to any
such Acquisition Proposal and, taking into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Cascade, the Board of Directors of
Home (or applicable committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event any such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and is thereafter amended or
modified, such amended or modified Acquisition Proposal shall require Home to
give a new notice to Cascade in accordance with this Section 6.8(d) (except
that the notice period shall be three (3) business days instead of four (4)
business days) before the Board of Directors of Home (or applicable committee
thereof) can make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(f).

 

  

  

(d) Home will promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) advise
Cascade in writing following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the
substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Cascade apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions, whether written or oral, of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current
basis.

  

  

(e) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set forth
below:

  

  

"Acquisition Proposal" means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Home or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner
more than 20% of the voting power in, or more than 20% of the fair market
value of the business, assets or deposits of, Home or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of Home concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger, (i) after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors (ii) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law; provided, however, that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more
than 20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority".

  

  

6.9 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Parties shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein. Each of Home and Cascade shall promptly inform the other in writing
upon receiving notice of any Action by any Governmental Entity or third party
against, or threatened against, it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets, properties, or any of their respective directors, officers
or employees in their individual capacities as such.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.10 Correction of Information. Each of Home and Cascade shall promptly
correct and supplement in writing any information furnished under this
Agreement so that such information shall be correct and complete in all
material respects at all times, without taking into account the Article III
Standard or Article IV Standard, as applicable, and shall include all facts

as applicable, as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

  

  

(b) by either Home or Cascade, if (i) (A) any Governmental Entity that must

  permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger; provided, however, that a Party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b) if such denial is attributable to the failure of such Party to perform
any covenant in this Agreement required to be performed prior to the Effective
Time;

 

  

  

(c) by either Home or Cascade, if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before June 30, 2014 unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such

Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set
forth in this Agreement;

  

  

(d) by either Home or Cascade (provided that the terminating party is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other

covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth

(20) days following written notice to the Party committing such breach or by
its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

immediately preceding the Closing Date if:

  

  

    

(i)

Index Change Ratio and the Closing Price Change Ratio or (y) in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(j)(ii), that the Aggregate Stock

immediately pay Cascade the Termination Fee in same-day funds. For purposes of

strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.
