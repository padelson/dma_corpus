 WHEREAS, Sellers desire to sell and cause the Other Sellers to sell, and Purchasers desire to purchase, the Shares on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 
 SALE OF SHARES AND CLOSING 

   

 1.01 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing: (a) U.S. Seller shall sell, convey, assign and transfer to U.S. Purchaser the ASI Shares, and the U.S. Purchaser shall purchase all of the U.S. Sellers right, title and interest in and to the ASI Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Encumbrances created or suffered to exist by Purchasers; (b) International Seller shall sell, convey, assign and transfer to International Purchaser the ASSA Shares owned by International Seller, and the International Purchaser shall purchase all of the International Sellers right, title and interest in and to such ASSA Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Encumbrances created or suffered 

    #####

each Other Seller shall, sell, convey, assign and transfer to the
International Purchaser the ASSA Share owned by such Other Seller, and
International Purchaser shall purchase the Other Sellers right, title and

Purchasers. 

   

 1.02 _Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchasers shall pay, in consideration for the purchase of the Shares pursuant to _Section 1.01_, in cash $360,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The payment of the Purchase Price shall not be reduced by any withholdings or deductions except to the extent required by United States or foreign Laws. 

   

 1.03 _Tax Treatment of Purchase Price_  

   

 (a) Not later than five (5) days after the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall deliver to Purchasers for their review and comment an allocation of the Purchase Price to the Shares based on an estimate of the fair market values of the ASI Shares and ASSA Shares. If Sellers and Purchasers are unable to reach agreement on the allocation of the Purchase Price within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the allocation to the Purchasers, the allocation of Purchase Price shall be determined by an internationally-recognized independent accounting firm mutually selected by Sellers and Purchasers (" _Independent Expert_ ") using customary valuation methodologies; provided, however, that the Independent Expert shall make its determination within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. The determination made by the Independent Expert shall be, absent manifest error, final and binding on Purchasers and Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be shared equally between Sellers and Purchasers. 

  

 (b) Purchasers, Sellers, Other Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates shall: (i) treat the amounts allocated to each of ASI and ASSA pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ as the purchase price of the respective entity for Tax purposes; (ii) be bound by the allocations determined pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ for purposes of determining any Taxes; and (iii) prepare and file, and cause their Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis consistent with these allocations. None of Purchasers, Sellers, Other Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with these allocations in any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise unless required by final determination by an applicable Taxing Authority. In the event that an allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and Purchasers and Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to defend such allocations in any audit or similar proceeding. 

  

 1.04 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ "), which shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,

or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) or at such other time or date as Purchasers and Sellers may
mutually agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). Unless the parties
otherwise agree in writing, the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred at

 (j) termination of the Contrats de Pret a la Consommation entered into between International Seller and each of the Other Sellers; 

  

 (k) copies of the opinions of the works councils of International Seller and ASSA relating to the consultations contemplated by _Section 11.15_; and 

  

 (l) for each of ASI and SNAC, a good standing certificate, dated within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, issued by the Delaware Secretary of States office, and for ASSA, a Kbis extract from the commercial register, dated within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 1.06 _Closing Deliveries by Purchasers_. At the Closing, Purchasers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the applicable Purchaser: 

   

 (a) the Purchase Price, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by U.S. Seller no later than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date; 

  

 (b) the Transition Services Agreement as executed by Purchasers; and 

  

 (c) the certificate described in _Section 7.02(a)_. 

  

 1.07 _Closing Working Capital_. 

   

 (a) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Purchasers an unaudited statement setting forth Sellers calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), which shall set forth Sellers calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_ "). Closing Working Capital and Final Working Capital shall be reduced by an amount equal to the asset value of the inventory described in _Schedule 2.07_;  _provided_ that if a reserve with respect to such inventory has been included in Closing Working Capital or Final Working Capital, then such reduction shall not be made to the extent it duplicates the reserve. 

  

 (b) Upon receipt from Sellers, Purchasers shall have thirty (30) days to review the Closing Working Capital Statement (the " _Review Period_ "). If Purchasers disagree with Sellers computation of Closing Working Capital, Purchasers may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to Sellers (a " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets forth their objections to Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which Purchasers disagree, together with a detailed written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth Purchasers calculation of Closing Working Capital based on such objections. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, Purchasers shall be deemed to have agreed with Sellers calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Working Capital Statement. 

  

Execution Copy 

    ##### 

  

  

 (c) Unless Purchasers deliver a Notice of Objection to Sellers within the Review Period, Purchasers shall be deemed to have accepted Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding. If Purchasers deliver a Notice of Objection to Sellers within the Review Period, Purchasers and Sellers shall, during the ten (10) days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, Purchasers and Sellers are unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to an Independent Expert. The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review this _Section 1.07_ and to determine solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on written submissions by Purchasers and Sellers and not on an independent review. Purchasers and Sellers shall make available to the Independent Expert all relevant Books and Records and other items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. The parties shall request that the Independent Expert deliver to Purchasers and Sellers, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days after its retention, a report which sets forth its resolution of the disputed items and amounts and its calculation of Closing Working Capital; provided that in no event shall Closing Working Capital as determined by the Independent Expert be more than Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement nor less than Purchasers calculation of Closing Working Capital set forth in the Notice of Objection. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between the parties by the Independent Expert based upon the relative differences between the position asserted by each party and the final resolution of the disputed items, with the party asserting a position further from the final resolution bearing a proportionately greater share of such costs and expenses. 

  

 1.08 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) " _Final Working Capital_ " means the Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in the Closing Working Capital Statement, if no Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely delivered; or (ii) if a Notice of Objection is so delivered, then as agreed by Purchasers and Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_ or, in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Independent Experts calculation. If Final Working Capital is less than $43,362,000, Sellers shall pay to Purchasers, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 1.08(b)_, an amount of cash equal to the difference between $43,362,000 and Final Working Capital (the " _Deficit Amount_ "). If Final Working Capital exceeds $43,362,000, Purchasers shall pay to Sellers, in the manner and with interest as provided in  _Section 1.08(b)_, an amount of cash equal to the difference between Final Working Capital and $43,362,000 (the " _Excess Amount_ "). 

  

Execution Copy 

    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Within five (5) Business Days after Final Working Capital has been finally determined, (i) if there is a Deficit Amount, Sellers shall pay to Purchasers an amount equal to such Deficit Amount, together with interest calculated as set forth below, and (ii) if there is an Excess Amount, Purchasers shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to such Excess Amount, together with interest calculated as set forth below. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts as designated in writing by Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may be. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this  _Section 1.08_ shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding. 

  

 (c) Any rights accruing to a party under this _Section 1.08_ shall be in addition to and independent of the rights to indemnification under Article IX. Any payments made to any party under this _Section 1.08_ shall not be subject to the terms of Article IX. Any Deficit Amount owing to Purchasers shall be the joint and several obligation of Sellers. 

  

 (d) For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat the payment of the Deficit Amount or Excess Amount, as the case may be, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price except to the extent applicable Law requires otherwise. The amount of such adjustment shall be allocated between the Shares of ASI and ASSA in accordance with the principles and in the manner set forth in _Section 1.03(a)_ for the allocation of Purchase Price, taking into account the ASI Working Capital and the ASSA Working Capital. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS 

   

 Except as otherwise set forth in a schedule to any particular representation and warranty (with specific reference to the particular Section of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such schedule relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other schedule thereof to which its relevance is readily apparent on its face), Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Purchasers that all of the statements contained in this _Article II_ are true as of the date of this Agreement (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date). The inclusion of any information in a schedule to this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

ARTICLE V 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 5.01 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Employment_. As of the Closing, Purchasers shall cause the Spine Entities to continue to employ each of the Business Employees in each case in the same position and on substantially the same terms and conditions (including wages and incentive compensation opportunity) as provided by the applicable Spine Entity for such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Purchasers agree that they shall not, nor shall they cause ASSA to, relocate the Non-U.S. Business Employees during the two-year period following the Closing Date to a work location more than 20 km from the location at which such employees are employed immediately prior to the Closing. Except as required by Law, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchasers or one of their respective Affiliates to continue the employment of any specific person. 

  

 (b) _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. Immediately following the Closing and continuing until December 31, 2009, Purchasers shall or shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide to the Business Employees who remain in the employment of Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates: 

   

 (i) in the case of U.S. Business Employees, (x) base salary or wage rates and other cash compensation (other than equity compensation and incentive compensation) that, in the aggregate, are not less than the base salary or wage rates and other cash compensation in effect for each such U.S. Business Employee immediately prior to Closing; and (y) employee benefits, including equity compensation and incentive compensation, that are comparable to those made available by U.S. Purchaser to its similarly situated employees; and 

   

 (ii) in the case of Non-U.S. Business Employees, (x) base salary or wage rates, equity compensation and incentive compensation and other cash compensation, and (y) employee benefits (including supplementary pension Plan, complementary pension Plan, medical, dental and vision insurance, basic and supplemental life insurance, short and long-term disability insurance, mandatory profit sharing scheme, voluntary profit sharing scheme, employee savings Plan 

  

Execution Copy

   ##### 

  

    

and all and any other employee benefits paid or provided to Non-U.S. Business
Employees immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with the policies of
ASSA or any of its Affiliates such as tuition assistance, adoption
assistance, childcare assistance, management car Plan and transportation
allowance) that, on an individual basis, are of economically similar value to
those paid or provided to each such Non-U.S. Business Employee by ASSA or any
of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing. Except as required by Law
or as otherwise provided in this Article V, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchasers or one of their
respective Affiliates to continue any specific Plan. 

  

 (c) _Severance Benefits and Liabilities_. Immediately following the Closing and continuing until December 31, 2009, Purchasers shall or shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide to the Business Employees severance benefits that are no less favorable on an individual basis than the severance benefits that would have been applicable to each such Business Employee under the applicable Spine Entitys severance Plans or individual agreements, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Closing, taking into account each such Business Employees additional period of service and rate of base pay or wages and bonus target with Purchasers or their Affiliates following the Closing. Purchasers and their respective Affiliates shall be solely responsible for any severance, change in control, redundancy or similar termination payments or benefits that may become payable to any Business Employee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchasers shall jointly and severally indemnify Sellers and their respective Affiliates from any and all Liabilities for such payments and benefits. To the extent that Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates become liable for, or are legally required to make, severance, change in control, redundancy or similar termination payments or benefits to any Business Employee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchasers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, reimburse Sellers, as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days of receipt from Sellers of appropriate verification, for all payments, costs and expenses actually paid by Sellers or their respective Affiliates as required by applicable Law or any Contract. 

  

 (d) _Service Credit_. 

   

 (i) Except as provided in subsection 5.01(d)(ii), Purchasers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, recognize the prior service, compensation and seniority of, or recognized with respect to, each Business Employee as if such service had been performed with, and such compensation and seniority had been earned with, Purchasers for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting, service related level of benefits and benefit accrual under the employee benefit Plans and policies provided by Purchasers to the Business Employees following the Closing (but excluding in the case of U.S. Business Employees benefit accruals 

  

Execution Copy

   ##### 

  

    

under any defined benefit pension plans), to the same extent such service,
compensation and seniority is recognized by Sellers or their Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing, except to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. 

   

 (ii) Purchasers shall not be required to, and shall not be required to cause their Affiliates to, recognize the prior service, compensation and seniority of, or recognized with respect to, any U.S. Business Employee as if such service had been performed with, and such compensation and seniority had been earned with Purchaser for the following purposes: (x) eligibility for participation or benefit accrual under the Zimmer Retirement Income Plan and/or the Zimmer Benefit Equalization Plan for the Retirement Income Plan; or (y) eligibility for participation or benefit accrual under the Zimmer Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plan. 

  

 (e) _Welfare Plans_. With respect to any welfare Plan maintained by Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates in which Business Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, Purchasers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Business Employees and his or her covered spouse and/or dependents to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such Business Employees under the analogous welfare Plans maintained by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) provide each Business Employee with credit for any co-insurance, deductibles and accumulations toward out-of-pocket maximums paid by such Business Employee and his or her covered spouse and/or dependents prior to Closing in the Plan year in which the Closing occurs under the group health care Plans maintained by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such group health care Plan maintained by Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that no such credit shall affect the applicable limits under any such welfare Plan maintained by Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates or entitle any Business Employee (or covered spouse or dependent) to any refund because such credit exceeds any limit imposed by Purchasers Plan. Sellers shall, at their sole cost and expense, provide Purchasers group health plan with a report setting forth all co-insurance, deductibles and accumulations toward out-of-pocket maximums paid by the Business Employees under any such Plan of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates as of the Closing Date and as of the date six (6) months following the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, Purchasers or their respective Affiliates shall assume all obligations for providing coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, to U.S. Business Employees (and their eligible dependents). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall retain responsibility under the Seller welfare Plans in which the Business Employees participate with respect to all welfare benefit claims incurred by the Business Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the 

  

Execution Copy

   ##### 

  

    

Closing, expressly excluding disability claims. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, (i) a welfare benefit claim under a group health plan shall be
considered incurred on the date when the services are rendered or supplies
are provided and not when the condition arose or when the course of treatment
began, (ii) a welfare benefit claim under a life insurance benefit plan shall
be considered incurred on the date of death and (iii) a claim for workers
compensation shall not be considered and is not a welfare benefit claim. 

  

 (f) _Flexible Spending Account_. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have in effect flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria Plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Purchaser FSA Plans_ "). Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser FSA Plans to accept a spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts of each Business Employee who participates in the cafeteria Plans maintained by Sellers or their respective Affiliates (the " _Seller FSA Plans_ ") immediately prior to the Closing and to honor and continue through December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs the elections made by each Business Employee under the Seller FSA Plans in respect of such flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall cause to be transferred from the Seller FSA Plans to the Purchaser FSA Plans the excess, if any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made by Business Employees prior to the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs over the aggregate reimbursement payouts paid or payable to the Business Employees for such year from such accounts. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims by Business Employees under the Seller FSA Plans incurred at any time during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing. If the Closing occurs after December 31, 2008, Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall maintain and continue to process claims related to the 2008 Plan year for such Seller FSA Plans. 

  

 (g) _U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. As of the Closing: (i) U.S. Business Employees who do not, as of the Closing, have an accrued benefit under the defined benefit pension Plans maintained by U.S. Seller or its Affiliates in the United States (collectively, the " _U.S. Seller Pension Plans_ ") shall cease to be eligible to accrue benefits in the U.S. Seller Pension Plans; and (ii) U.S. Business Employees who, as of the Closing, have an accrued benefit under the U.S. Seller Pension Plans shall cease to accrue additional benefits and their accrued benefits shall be frozen under the U.S. Seller Pension Plans.

Effective as of the Closing, Purchasers shall establish or designate defined contribution pension Plans (collectively, the " _Purchaser DC Plans_ ") for the benefit of the Business Employees who participated in one or more of the defined contribution pension Plans maintained by Sellers or their respective Affiliates in the United States that are intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Seller DC Plans_ "). Such Business

Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _DC Employees_ ". Sellers shall
cause Seller DC Plans to fully vest the account balances of all DC Employees.
Each Purchaser DC Plan shall provide for the receipt from DC Employees of
"eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under Section 402
of the Code) in cash and promissory notes evidencing outstanding loans to DC
Employees, which shall be transferred in-kind. Purchaser agrees to take all
actions necessary to cause the Purchaser DC Plans to accept such eligible
rollover distributions. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall provide Sellers, and Sellers shall provide Purchasers, a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating
that the Purchaser DC Plans in the case of the Purchasers, and the Seller DC
Plans in the case of the Sellers, are qualified under Code Section 401(a).
Each DC Employee shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of
his or her account balance under any Seller DC Plan and shall be given the
opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account balance, including
outstanding Plan loan obligations in-kind, to a Purchaser DC Plan, subject to
and in accordance with the provisions of such plan(s) and applicable Law,
provided that such "rollover" of outstanding Plan loan obligations shall
occur as soon as administratively practicable, but it no event later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing. Purchasers and Sellers shall work
together in order to facilitate any such distribution or rollover and to
effect an eligible rollover distribution for those DC Employees who elect to
rollover their account balances and outstanding Plan loan obligations directly
into a Purchaser DC Plan. 

  

 (i) _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation_. Effective as of the Closing, Purchasers shall make available deferred compensation (defined contribution) arrangements that are not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to the Business Employees who participated in one or more of the deferred compensation (defined contribution) arrangements maintained in the United States that are not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code maintained by Sellers or their respective Affiliates (the " _Seller NQ Plans_ ") with respect to the service of such Business Employees following the Closing. As of the Closing, Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall retain all Liabilities and obligations for all accrued obligations attributable to the Business Employees under each Seller NQ Plan. Purchasers and their respective Affiliates shall provide to Sellers and their respective Affiliates any and all records and information with respect to the Business Employees reasonably required by Sellers and their respective Affiliates to enable Sellers and their respective Affiliates to properly administer the Seller NQ Plans following the Closing. Such provision of records and information shall occur (a) on each anniversary of the Closing Date or (b) with respect to records and information relevant to the Business Employees separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of such separation from service. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall have the right to communicate with the Business Employees following the Closing with respect to the accrued obligations attributable to the Business Employees under each Seller NQ Plan (including with respect to the amount of such accrued obligations, the Business Employees rights to receive a distribution of such accrued obligations, and the Business Employees elections

As of the Closing, Business Employees shall be eligible to participate in the employee stock purchase plans sponsored by Purchasers in accordance with the terms of such Plans.

Sellers shall not be responsible or otherwise liable for the provision of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage to any Business Employee who retires on or after the Closing. Unless due to Purchasers own actions, Purchasers shall not be required to offer or provide post retirement healthcare or life insurance to any Business Employee, except as required by French Law, or for purposes of U.S. Business Employees, except as required by applicable federal or state statutes requiring the offer of continuation coverage or conversion rights. 

  

 (l) _Treatment of Unvested Options and Restricted Stock Units_. With respect to each outstanding unvested stock option and unvested restricted stock unit held by a Business Employee as of the Closing that is forfeited by such Business Employee solely due to the Closing, Sellers shall pay each such Business Employee the following amounts, subject to any required withholding taxes, as soon as practicable following the effective date of such forfeiture: 

   

 (i) with respect to each such forfeited stock option, an amount equal to the product of (a) the excess of (1) the closing per share trading price of a U.S. Seller common share on the Closing Date, over (2) the exercise price of the forfeited stock option multiplied by (b) the number of U.S. Seller common shares subject to the forfeited stock option as of the Closing Date; and

Purchasers. Sellers will deliver to Purchasers a computation of the amount of
any Taxes (the " _Excess Tax Amount_ ") which may be imposed on Sellers or
their Affiliates as a result of a Section 338 Election, such amount being (i)
the excess of the amount of Taxes payable by Sellers or their Affiliates with
such Section 338 Election having been made over the amount of Taxes that
would have been payable if such Section 338 Election had not been made, plus
(ii) the Taxes imposed on Sellers or their Affiliates as a result of
the payments made pursuant to this _Section 6.08_ (including the payments
described in this clause (ii)) _provided_ that for purposes of determining
the Excess Tax Amount with respect to an election, the relevant Seller or
Seller Affiliate shall be deemed to have paid Taxes in respect of such an
election to the extent that it is required under Law to absorb any Tax
attribute (including, without limitation, foreign tax credits) in excess of
the Tax attributes that would have been absorbed had no such election been
made. If Sellers and Purchasers are unable to reach agreement on the Excess
Tax Amount within thirty (30) days following delivery of
Sellers computation, then the Excess Tax Amount shall be determined by an
Independent Expert, who shall make its determination within thirty (30) days
following the date on which it was retained. The determination of the
Independent Expert shall be, absent manifest error, final and binding
on Purchasers and Sellers. Purchasers shall pay the Excess Tax Amount as
additional Purchase Price to Sellers within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Excess Tax Amount is agreed to by the parties or
determined by the Independent Expert, as the case may be. Purchasers shall

Tax Amount; _provided_  that the cost of the Independent Expert shall be
shared equally by Purchasers and Sellers.
