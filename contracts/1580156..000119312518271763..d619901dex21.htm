1.2 _Purchase Price and Allocation_.

 

(a) _Purchase Price_. Regardless of whether the transfer of any Acquired Asset
has been deferred pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, in
consideration for the sale and transfer of the Acquired Assets, and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall at the Closing assume
the Assumed Liabilities as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(c)_ and shall pay
to Seller in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
$140,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ ").

shall promptly thereafter cause the Neutral Accountant to resolve any
remaining disputes. Any costs and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be
allocated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4(e)_. In the event that any
subsequent adjustment to the Purchase Price occurs as a result of (i) any
indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any adjustment to
the amount of Assumed Liabilities or (iii) any other reason, the allocations
under this _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_ shall be adjusted as necessary by the
Parties. The Proposed Allocation Schedule (and any adjustments thereto) shall
be prepared in accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). The Parties recognize that
the Adjusted Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities do not include Buyers
acquisition expenses. The Parties agree to act in accordance with the
computations and allocations contained in the Proposed Allocation Schedule, to
the extent no Buyers Allocation Notice has been delivered (or, if a Buyers
Allocation Notice has been delivered, as revised by the Parties or the Neutral
Accountant in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_), in any relevant
Tax Returns (as defined in  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_) or filings (including any

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer a statement (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") calculating
the Closing Working Capital Amount (as defined in _Section_ __ _
1.4(a)(iii)_). For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Accounting Principles_ " means the same accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as used in the sample Working Capital
Statement set forth on _Schedule 1.4(a)_ ;

 

(ii) _"_ _Closing Working Capital_ _Adjustment Amount_ " means the Closing
Working Capital Amount minus the Target Working Capital Amount (whether
positive or negative);

(iii) " _Closing Working Capital Amount_ " means the amount of Working
Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date;

(iv) " _Target Working Capital Amount_ " means negative $4,700,552; and

(v) " _Working Capital_ " means (i) the current assets of the Business

of clarity, contract assets) less (ii) the current liabilities of
the Business included in the Assumed Liabilities of the type reflected in the
sample Working Capital Statement set forth on _Schedule 1.4(a)_ (including,
for the purpose of clarity, short term and long term deferred revenue), in
each case calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(b) If Buyer in good faith disputes the Closing Working Capital Amount as
shown on the Closing Working Capital Statement prepared by Seller, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller, within 90 days after receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Statement, a statement (the " _Dispute Statement_ ") setting forth
Buyers calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount and describing in
reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such different Closing
Working Capital Amount. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such differences regarding the determination of the Closing Working Capital
Amount for a period of 30 days after Buyer has delivered the Dispute
Statement. If the Parties resolve such differences, the Closing Working
Capital Amount agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the " _Final
Closing Working Capital Amount_ " and the Closing Working Capital Statement
agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the " _Final Closing Working
Capital Statement_."

 

(c) If the Parties do not reach a final resolution on the Closing Working
Capital Amount within 30 days after Buyer has delivered the
Dispute Statement, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to continue
their efforts to resolve such differences, Deloitte LLP (the " _Neutral
Accountant_ ") shall resolve such differences, pursuant to an engagement
agreement executed by the Parties and the Neutral Accountant, in the manner
provided below. The Parties shall each be entitled to make a presentation to
the Neutral Accountant, pursuant to procedures to be agreed to among the
Parties and the Neutral Accountant (or, if they cannot

 



\- 10 -

    

 agree on such procedures, pursuant to procedures determined by the Neutral
Accountant), regarding such Partys calculation of the Closing Working Capital
Amount; and the Neutral Accountant shall be required to resolve the
differences between the Parties and determine the Closing Working Capital
Amount within 20 Business Days thereafter. The Closing Working Capital Amount
determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed to be the " _Final
Closing Working Capital Amount_ " and the Closing Working Capital Statement,
as adjusted to reflect such determination, shall be deemed to be the " _Final
Closing Working Capital Statement_ ". Such determination by the Neutral
Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent fraud or
manifest error. In determining the Final Closing Working Capital Amount and
the Final Closing Working Capital Statement, the Neutral Accountant shall act
as an expert and not as arbitrator, and the Neutral Accountants authority is
limited to resolving disputed issues of fact (and not law). The procedures set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ concerning the determination of the
Final Closing Working Capital Amount and the Final Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be governed by the law of expert determination and appraisal
rather than the law of arbitration.

 

(d) The Neutral Accountant shall not be authorized or permitted to:

 

(i) determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with
this Agreement except for the resolution of differences between the Parties
regarding the determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_; or

Working Capital Statement that is outside of the range defined by amounts as
proposed by the Parties in the Closing Working Capital Statement or the
Dispute Notice, as applicable.

(e) The Parties shall each pay one half of the fees and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant; _provided_ that if the Neutral Accountant determines that
one Party has adopted a position or positions with respect to the Closing
Working Capital Statement that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the
Neutral Accountant (i) may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of any
such fees and expenses to such Party and (ii) shall provide to the Parties a
written explanation of its reasons for making such a determination in the
event that it does so.

(f) The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
1.4_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Working Capital Amount
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes,
provided that this provision shall not prohibit either Party from instituting
litigation to enforce the ruling of the Neutral Accountant.

(g) Failure of Buyer to deliver a Dispute Statement within 30 days after
receiving the Closing Working Capital Statement shall constitute acceptance of
the Closing Working Capital Amount set forth on the Closing Working Capital
Statement, whereupon such Closing Working Capital Amount shall be deemed to be
the Final Closing Working Capital Amount and the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Working Capital Statement.
Delivery by Buyer of a Dispute Statement shall constitute final and binding
acceptance by Buyer of all portions of the Closing Working Capital Statement
other than those specifically identified in the Dispute Statement as being
subject to a good faith dispute.

 



\- 11 -

    

(h) If the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is less than Target Working
Capital Amount, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
difference between the Target Working Capital Amount and the Final Closing
Working Capital Amount. If the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is more
than the Target Working Capital Amount, then Buyer shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to Seller an amount equal to the difference between the Final Closing
Working Capital Amount and the Target Working Capital Amount. Any payment
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(h)_ shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into an account or accounts designated
by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, within five Business Days after the
date on which the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is determined pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " means the
Purchase Price plus, if applicable, the amount of the payment required to be
made by Buyer to Seller pursuant to the second sentence of _Section_ __ _
1.4(h)_ or minus, if applicable, the amount of the payment required to be
made by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the first sentence of _Section_ __ _
1.4(h)_.

1.5 _Consents to Assignment_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Acquired Asset if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof
without the Consent of a third party thereto that has not been obtained prior
to the Closing would constitute a breach or default thereof, would result in a
violation of the rights of any such third party or applicable law, is
cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment, or would otherwise
be ineffective (provided that this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ shall not affect
whether any such asset, property or right shall be deemed to be an Acquired
Asset for any other purpose under this Agreement). If such Consent
with respect to an Acquired Asset (a " _Deferred Consent_ ") is not obtained,
then (a) the Acquired Asset to which such Deferred Consent relates (a "
_Deferred Asset_ ") shall be withheld from the assignment and transfer at the
Closing without any reduction in the Purchase Price, (b) only if such Deferred
Asset is a contract identified on _Schedule 1.5_ attached hereto (each, a "
_Specified Contract_ "), from and after the Closing, the Parties will
cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain such Deferred Consent with
respect to such Specified Contract as soon as practicable after the Closing,
and (c) until such Deferred Consent is obtained, the Parties shall cooperate,
in all reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which (i) Buyer would obtain
(without infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic
claims, rights and benefits (net of the amount of any liabilities or
obligations imposed on Seller or any of its Affiliates under the Deferred
Asset) and (ii) Buyer would assume any related economic burden (including the
amount of any liabilities or obligations imposed on Seller or any of its
Affiliates) and be responsible for, and would pay, perform and discharge when
due, all liabilities and obligations of Seller with respect to the Deferred
Asset (including, for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, all liabilities and obligations under any contract that is a
Deferred Asset). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" shall
have the meaning assigned to it in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Following the Closing, Seller shall (subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_)
reimburse Buyer for one-half of, without duplication, any (x) reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer related to any failure
to obtain any Consent required to assign pursuant hereto Sellers right, title
and interest in any Acquired Contract and (y) payments made by Buyer to any
counterparty to an Acquired Contract in consideration of such counterparty

 



\- 12 -

    

 granting its Consent to Seller assigning pursuant hereto its right, title
and interest in such Acquired Contract (other than payments expressly required
by the terms of any Deferred Asset that is an Acquired Contract to be made by
Seller to any counterparty thereto in consideration of such Counterparty
providing its Consent to the assignment of such Acquired Contract pursuant
hereto or in connection with any such counterpartys consideration of the
request for such Consent, which shall be the obligation of Seller pursuant to
clause (a) of _Section_ __ _ 1.6_); _provided_ that Sellers aggregate
liability under this sentence shall not exceed $500,000.

1.6 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by either Party hereto and at such Partys
expense, the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are
necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ or this _Section_
__ _ 1.6_ shall require a Party (or any of its Affiliates) to (a) pay or
agree to pay any amounts or other consideration to any third party (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, amounts payable to Buyer pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 1.5_) (except that Seller shall make any payments
expressly required by the terms of any Deferred Asset that is an Acquired
Contract to be made by Seller to any counterparty thereto in consideration of
such Counterparty providing its Consent to the assignment of such Acquired
Contract pursuant hereto or in connection with any such counterpartys
consideration of the request for such Consent), (b) agree to the imposition of
any limitation or obligation on its business or operations (including
with respect to the Business), (c) provide or agree to provide any additional
security (including a guaranty), (d) agree to any modifications of existing
contracts or the entry into any new contracts, (e) agree to any material
undertakings in connection therewith with any third party or (f) seek a
Consent with respect to any contract, agreement, commitment or lease
contemplated to be assigned to Buyer pursuant hereto other than a Specified
Contract.

(a) If, after the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
payment, refund or other amount that is, or arises out of, any Acquired Asset
(or any current asset reflected on the Final Working Capital Schedule) or is
otherwise properly due and owing to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such
amount to Buyer.

(b) If, after the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives any

(other than in respect of any current asset reflected on the Final Working
Capital Schedule) or is otherwise properly due and owing to Seller in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Buyer promptly shall remit, or
shall cause to be remitted, such amount to Seller.

(c) If, after the Closing, either Party (or any of their respective
Affiliates) discovers that possession and/or effective operating control of

shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) immediately cease using such
assets and (B) cooperate with Seller to return to Seller (or its designee)
possession and/or

 



\- 13 -

entity and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of such person or entity and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (and a going concern basis) will be

such person or entity and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their
debts and other liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise,
as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such
person or entity and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in which they
are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be
conducted following the Closing Date and (d) such person or entity and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and
liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured.

and complete copies of any written contracts and agreements in existence on
the date hereof between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any employee of the Business, on the other hand, that would become effective
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.9  _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, except for the representations and warranties set forth in
Article II (each as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule), (a) neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of their respective equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors,
nor any other person or entity, has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Business, any Acquired Asset
or any Assumed Liability, including with respect to any information provided

 its Affiliates, equityholders, directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents, representatives or advisors, or any other person or entity, or the use
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, equityholders, directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other person
or entity, of any such information provided or made available to any of them
by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors,
or any other person or entity, including any information, documents,
estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking
information, business plans or other material provided or made available to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, equityholders, directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any other person or entity,
in "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management
presentations, whether in anticipation or contemplation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, and (subject to the express
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article II or in any
certificate, document or instrument delivered at the Closing pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (in each case as qualified and limited by the
Disclosure Schedule)) none of Buyer, or any of its Affiliates,
equityholders, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, or any other person or entity, has relied on any
such information (including the accuracy or completeness thereof); _provided
that_ the foregoing shall not be deemed to modify any of the representations
and warranties set forth in _Article II_ , and shall not limit Buyers rights
pursuant to _Article VI_ in respect of Fraud. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Fraud_ " means Delaware common law fraud with a specific intent to deceive
based on a false representation and warranty contained in this Agreement as to
a material fact (it being understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, that "Fraud" does not include
any equitable fraud or any tort based on negligence or recklessness).

3.10 _Non-Reliance on Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking
Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Business by Buyer and its Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or
advisors, Buyer and its Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors have received and may continue
to receive after the date hereof from Seller and its Affiliates,
equityholders, directors, mangers, officers, employees, agents,
representatives and advisors certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan
information, regarding the Business. Buyer hereby acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Buyer is familiar, that Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that Buyer will have no claim against
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective equityholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, or any
other person or entity, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates, nor any
of their respective equityholders, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives or advisors, nor any other person or entity, has made or is
making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.10_
shall be deemed to modify any of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article II_ or otherwise limit Buyers rights pursuant to _Article VI_ in
respect of Fraud.

within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i)

expresses that is not reasonably likely to be able to provide the full Equity

any reason (other than as a result of the failure of the conditions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ to be satisfied) Buyer no longer believes in good
faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Equity
Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

4.6 _Debt Financing Commitments_.

 

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with
such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(including the syndication thereof (which syndication, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not be a prerequisite to funding of the Debt Financing)) as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer, provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller and its
Affiliates. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with such cooperation. Such cooperation will include
(i) assistance in Buyers preparation of any bank books, rating agency

assisting with the preparation of (but not executing) any pledge and security
documents and other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer or the Financing Source, and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (and the release and termination of
related liens on the Acquired Assets on or prior to the Closing Date) and the
granting of security interests in respect of the Debt Financing, it being
understood that such documents will not take effect until the Closing and
(vii) furnishing Buyer and the Financing Source with all documentation and
other information available to Seller required by regulatory authorities
pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules

foregoing, in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be required to
(x) provide (1) any information regarding any post-Closing or pro forma
financial statements, post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired to be
incorporated into any information used in connection with the Financing
(including any synergies or cost savings), projections, 

 



\- 41 -

    

 ownership or an as-adjusted capitalization table or any financial statements
or information not available to Seller and prepared in the ordinary course

enter into any definitive agreement, issue any offering or information
document, incur any other liability or obligation, make any other payment or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing. In addition, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_ shall require
any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, conflict with or
violate the Sellers articles of organization or bylaws or any law, rule,
regulation, judgment or order. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding Seller or any of its Affiliates obtained by Buyer or its
representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information reasonably
requested by Buyer and specifically approved in writing by Seller for use
therein (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.1(b)_, as it applies to Sellers obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 4.6(a)_, shall be deemed satisfied unless there has occurred a Seller
Willful Breach of Sellers obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_;
_provided_ that for purposes of this sentence the phrase "material to the
ability of Buyer to obtain the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed substituted in lieu of the phrase "material to the
Business, taken as a whole" in clause (A) of _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)(ii)_.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the
Sellers obligations under _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_, none of the obtaining of
the Financing or any alternative financing, or the completion of any issuance
of securities contemplated by the Financing, is a condition to the Closing,
and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing or any alternative financing or the completion of any such issuance,
subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_.

4.7 _C_ _ompeting Transactions_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall
not, shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its representatives, officers, directors and
agents not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any third party (other
than Buyer and its Affiliates) for the acquisition of the Business or any
material portion of the Business or Acquired Assets (other than sales of
inventory or the grant of non-exclusive licenses to use Business Products in
the ordinary course of business) (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations (and as of the date hereof,
Seller shall immediately cease any such discussions or negotiations that are
ongoing) other than with Buyer, Seller and

 



\- 42 -

    

 their respective representatives, officers, directors, employees and agents
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or (c) furnish any confidential information
regarding the Business or the Acquired Assets to any third party in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal. Seller will notify Buyer promptly,
and in any event within 48 hours, if any third party makes an Acquisition
Proposal during the Pre-Closing Period (including the terms thereof and the
identity of such third party, subject to any existing applicable
confidentiality agreement or applicable legal requirement).

 

4.8 _N_ _otification_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall give prompt notice to Buyer
upon obtaining knowledge that any representation or warranty made by Seller
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Seller
to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement to be performed or
complied with by it under this Agreement, in any such case if such untruth or
inaccuracy, or such failure, would cause the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.1(a)_ __ or _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ to not be satisfied at such time;
_provided_ that no such notification shall be deemed to modify or qualify any
representation or warranty in this Agreement made by Seller.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer shall give prompt notice to Seller
upon obtaining knowledge that any representation or warranty made by Buyer in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Buyer to

representation or warranty in this Agreement made by Buyer.

respect of, and hold Buyer harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities,
monetary damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable

suffered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (to the extent such Damages are not
recoverable under the RandW Policy):

(a) to the extent resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in _Article II_ or the
certificate of Seller delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.1(d)_;

 

(b) to the extent resulting from any breach of, or failure to perform, any
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement; or

 

(c) to the extent resulting from or constituting Excluded Liabilities.

 

6.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article VI_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller in
respect of, and hold Seller harmless against, any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates:

borrowings of the Business that are subject to any guarantee, covenant,
indemnity, letter of comfort or similar assurance provided by Seller or any of
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date identified on _Schedule 4.2_.

6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-party claim
against an Indemnified Party (as defined below) shall be made in accordance
with the following procedures. A person or entity entitled to indemnification
under this _Article VI_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give written
notification (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ ") to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") within 30 days after
receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any action,
suit or proceeding relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification
may be sought or, if earlier, the assertion of any such claim by a third
party, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by
the Indemnified Party) the facts

 



\- 45 -

    

 constituting the basis for such claim and a good faith estimate of the
amount of the claimed Damages; _provided that_ _,_ the failure to notify or a
delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under _Section_ _s 6.1_ or _6.2_ , as applicable,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result thereof.
At any time after delivery of such Third-Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party and subject to
the rights of the Insurers under the RandW Policy to (at its own expense)
conduct the defense thereof, assume control of the defense of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party if and only if (i) the amount of Damages for which the
Indemnifying Party is potentially liable under this _Article VI_
in connection with such third party claim equals or exceeds one-half of (A)
the amount of Damages sought in such third party claim or (B) if such third
party claim is unliquidated, the reasonably likely amount of such Damages and
(ii) such third party claim does not seek an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (other than
incidental claims for equitable relief); _provided that_ , the Indemnified
Party can assume the defense of any third party claim (the defense of which
was previously assumed by the Indemnifying Party) in the event that the
Indemnifying Party fails to reasonably defend the claim, action or proceeding.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party not controlling such
defense (the " _Non-Controlling Party_") may participate therein at its own
expense (including by retaining separate counsel to monitor and consult with
respect to, and participate in but not direct, such defense); provided that,
if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with
respect to such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith
shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement; further
provided, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The
Party controlling such defense (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall keep the
Non-Controlling Party advised of the status of such action, suit, proceeding
or claim and the defense thereof and shall reasonably cooperate with the Non-
Controlling Party in all matters relating to such defense (including by
reasonably considering recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with
respect thereto). The Controlling Party shall not agree to any settlement or
compromise of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written
consent of the Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Non-Controlling Party may not settle or
compromise any such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior
written consent of the Controlling Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to agree to any settlement or
compromise without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such settlement or
compromise includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability with respect thereto and does not impose any affirmative obligation
or obligation (whether monetary or non-monetary), or any contingent liability
or obligation, on the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this _Article VI_ which is not subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") which contains (i) a description and the amount
(the " _Claimed Amount_ ") of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party,
(ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Article VI_ and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor,
and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such Damages.

 



\- 46 -

    

(c) _D_ _isputes_. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a written notice of
objection to the claims set forth in a Third-Party Claim Notice or a Claim
Notice (a " _Notice of Objection_ ") to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 30 days
following the delivery of a Notice of Objection, then the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 9.15_. The Indemnified Party shall also have the right to
submit a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_ to a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
9.15_ if the Indemnifying Party fails to deliver a Notice of Objection with
respect to such claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable
Third-Party Claim Notice or Claim Notice. 

6.4 _Survival_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.4(b), the representations and warranties of Seller
and Buyer set forth in this Agreement and the certificates delivered at
Closing pursuant to Section 5.1(d) and Section 5.2(c) shall survive the
Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
continue until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, at
which time they shall expire. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations and warranties (i) of Seller contained in _Sections 2.1_ ,
_2.2_ , _2.3_ , and _2.20_ (collectively, the "Seller Fundamental
Representations"), (ii) of Buyer contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and (iii)
of Seller contained in  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall survive the Closing until
the date that is thirty-six (36) months following the Closing Date. Those
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement which by their
terms contemplate performance at or prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing only until the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.
Those covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement which
by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing for a specific term
of undertaking shall survive the Closing only until the date that is twelve
(12) months after the expiration of the term of the undertaking set forth in
such agreement or covenant. All other covenants and other agreements
contained in this Agreement (including those covenants which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing for an unspecified term of
undertaking) shall survive the Closing until fully-performed.

(b) Neither Party shall have any liability or obligation of any nature with
respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement after the
expiration of the applicable survival period as provided in _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)_ above; provided that (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is the basis for any valid indemnification claim properly
asserted in writing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period of such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement (as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a))_ shall survive until
such claim is finally resolved and satisfied solely for purposes of resolving
such claim and (ii) no limitation on survival of any representation or
warranty shall apply to any claim for an indemnification relating to any
breach of a representation or warranty in respect of Fraud.

 



\- 47 -

    

(c) It is the express intent of the Parties that, if the applicable survival
period for an item as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ is shorter
than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to
such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened survival period
contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ for the assertion of claims under this
Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among the Parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties.

6.5  _Limitations_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.14_, from and after the Closing, the rights
of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article VI_ , rights pursuant to the
express terms of the Transition Services Agreement and the License Agreements
and, in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates, their rights under the RandW
Policy, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective Affiliates with respect to claims resulting from any
breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer, its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions consummated under this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the following limitations shall apply:

(i) no individual claim or series of related claims for indemnification
under  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ (other than in respect of Seller Fundamental
Representations) shall be valid and assertable unless it is (or they are) for
an amount in excess of $25,000 (the " _Basket_ ");

 

(ii) Seller shall be liable for Damages (x) in respect of representations and
warranties contained in _Article II_ or the certificate of Seller delivered
at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ (other than in respect of
Seller Fundamental Representations) for only that portion of the aggregate
such Damages that exceeds $1,400,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), (y) in respect
of Fundamental Representations, after the retention under the RandW Policy has
been satisfied, only to the extent the aggregate of all Damages in respect of
representations and warranties contained in  _Article II_ or the certificate
of Seller delivered at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_ exceeds
$14,000,000 and (z) in respect of those covenants and agreements contained
in  _Section_ __ _ 4.3_, for only that portion of the aggregate such Damages
that exceeds $250,000;

(iii) the aggregate liability of Seller for (x) all Damages in respect of

than in respect of Seller Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed
$1,400,000, (y) all Damages in respect of those covenants and agreements
contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ shall not exceed $10,000,000 and (z) for all
Damages under this Agreement shall not exceed $140,000,000;

 



\- 48 -

    

(iv) the aggregate liability of Buyer for all Damages under this Agreement
shall not exceed $140,000,000; and

(v) the amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_, shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or
provisions reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital Statement relating
thereto;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the limitations of this _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_ (other than the limitation set forth in clause (z) of _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)(iii)_ and the limitation set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(iv)_)
shall not apply to any claim based on Fraud.

(c) For purposes of this _Article VI_ , in determining whether any breach of
any representation or warranty has occurred (other than _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_ and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) and in calculating the
amount of any Damages with respect to any such breach, all qualifications in
such representation or warranty referencing the terms "material,"
"materiality," "Business Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or other terms of similar import or effect shall be disregarded.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all qualifications and limitations as to
materiality (including any qualifications by reference to "material,"
"materiality," "Business Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or other terms of similar import or effect) shall be given full effect
for purposes of determining whether there has been any Fraud, and this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_ shall not apply for such purposes.

(d) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable under
this _Article VI_ for any punitive Damages (except to the extent paid to a
third party).

(e) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article VI_ shall be reduced by any payments actually received by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (net of any reasonable costs
incurred in recovering or collecting such amounts) in respect of such
Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue, and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance and other third
party claims to which it may be entitled in connection with any
Damages indemnifiable pursuant to this _Article VI_ it incurs, and the
Parties shall cooperate with each other in pursuing insurance claims with
respect to any Damages or any indemnification obligations with respect to
Damages; _provided that_ no Party shall be required to commence litigation
against any material customer, material vendor or other material business
partner (other than an insurer) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall submit a claim
(and use reasonable best efforts to prosecute and obtain full recovery
(subject to the limitations of the RandW Policy) for such claim) under the RandW
Policy for any matter giving rise to indemnification hereunder that may be
covered thereby or insurable thereunder (after taking into account any
deductibles, retentions or other limitations set forth herein applicable to
the RandW Policy). If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any
insurance or other third party payment (including pursuant to the RandW Policy)
in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has already received an
indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to
the Indemnifying Party, within 10 Business Days of receiving such insurance
or other third party payment, an amount (the " _Refund Amount_ ") equal to the
excess of (i) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under
this Article VI from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim plus
the amount of the insurance and other third party payments

 



\- 49 -

    

 received, over (ii) the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party
with respect to such claim; _provided that_ (i) in no event will the Refund
Amount exceed the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party from
the Indemnifying Party under this _Article VI_ with respect to such claim and
in no event shall Buyer shall be required to return an amount previously
received from Seller or its Affiliates to the extent that such amounts were
used to satisfy the amount of the retention under the RandW Policy.

seek to mitigate any Damages (other than Taxes) which it is entitled to
recover under this Agreement.

information was not known by the Receiving Party at the time of receipt to be
bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other
party with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the
Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party (or its
Affiliates or representatives), provided that such source is not, to the
Receiving Partys knowledge at the time of receipt, bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to
such information, or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving
Party without utilizing any Information or violating any of the Receiving
Partys obligations under this Agreement), and the Receiving Party shall

except its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other
consultants and advisors, unless compelled to disclose such Information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of law or so as
not to violate the rules of any stock exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of disclosure compelled by judicial or administrative process, the
Receiving Party shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) notify the
Disclosing Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the Disclosing
Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is
compelled to disclose any Information by judicial or administration process,
such Receiving Party may so disclose the Information; _provided_ , _however_
, that at the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense of the
Disclosing Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Information required to be disclosed.

will be subject to the terms and conditions regarding confidentiality set
forth therein.

business with a person or entity not owned, managed, operated or controlled
by any Noncompetition Entity for purposes primarily unrelated to a Competitive
Business;

(c) making passive equity investments in publicly owned companies which

(i) in the calendar year prior to such acquisition, the consolidated revenues
of such person or entity from its Competitive Business do not constitute more

forth in the most recent financial statements of such person or entity at the
time the definitive agreement for such transaction is entered into; or

 

(ii) the applicable Noncompetition Entity transfers, within twelve (12) months

8.3 _Covenant Not to Solicit_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing until the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall not (and shall cause each Noncompetition Entity
not to) solicit or induce any person who was an employee or independent
contractor of, with respect to the Business, Seller on the Closing Date to
terminate his or her relationship with Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller or any Noncompetition Entity from (i)

employment with Seller or its Affiliates has been terminated for at least 90
days.

8.4 _Disclosure Generally_.

 

(a) Any information furnished in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
modify all of Sellers representations and warranties. The inclusion of any
information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material to the Business, taken as a
whole, has resulted in or would result in a Business Material Adverse Effect,
or is outside the ordinary course of business. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms "to Sellers knowledge," "known by Seller" or other words
of similar meaning shall mean the actual knowledge on the date hereof of the
persons listed on _Schedule_ _8.4(a)_ attached hereto, without any obligation
of investigation, and shall not refer to the knowledge of any other person or
entity. 

(b) Seller shall be entitled to submit to Buyer, from time to time between the
date hereof and the Closing, written updates to the Disclosure Schedule
disclosing any events or developments that occur or any information learned
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing; _provided_ _that_ in no
event shall any such update be deemed to modify or qualify Sellers
representations and warranties contained in _Article II_.

8.5 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Any real property, personal property or similar Taxes applicable to the
Acquired Assets for a taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as required by applicable law,
and such Taxes shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the
number of days in the portion of the taxable period that ends on and includes
the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_") and the number of days in

 



\- 55 -

    

 the entire taxable period. Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to any
such Taxes payable by Buyer which are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to any such Taxes payable
by Seller which are not attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such
payments shall be made on or prior to the Closing Date or, if later, on the
date such Taxes are due (or thereafter, promptly after request by Buyer or
Seller if such Taxes are not identified by Buyer or Seller on or prior to the
Closing Date).

 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any transfer, sales, use,
stamp, conveyance, VAT, recording, registration, documentary, filing and
other similar Taxes (other than Taxes based in whole or in part on net income
or profits) arising in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate
(and cause their Affiliates to reasonably cooperate) to minimize any such
Taxes, including by effecting the transfer of any Acquired Assets by
electronic means to the extent reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Upon written notice from Buyer after the Closing Date, Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to, with respect to any New Buyer Employees, (i)
treat Buyer as a "successor employer" and Seller as a "predecessor employer"
for purposes of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, and (ii) adopt
the "alternative procedure" for preparing and filing IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and
Tax Statements) as described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B.
320 (2004).

8.6 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Conduct; Other Liabilities_. Seller shall terminate,
effective as of the Closing, the employment of any employee engaged primarily
in the Business who is identified in _Schedule_ _8.6(a)_ (each a " _Business
Employee_ "). With respect to any New Buyer Employee, Buyer shall assume the
liability for General Compensation Liabilities (reimbursing Seller to the
extent that the liabilities are due from Seller in connection with termination
of employment and assuming any other such liabilities), excluding (i) any
accrued paid time off that remains unpaid as of the Closing Date (which such
amounts will be paid by Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing) and
(ii) the Seller Pro Rata Bonus Percentage of all liabilities or obligations
owing from Seller to the Business Employees for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2018 under Sellers corporate level cash bonus plan (provided
that Buyer shall not assume any Seller severance obligations with respect to
any Business Employee to whom Buyer or its subsidiary makes an offer in
compliance with _Sections 8.6(b)_ and _8.6(c)_ ), Employee Claim Liabilities,
and Residual Employee Liabilities, while Seller shall retain any Change in
Control Liabilities and General Benefit Liabilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Buyer fails to make an offer to a Business Employee or the
offer made to such Business Employees does not comply with _Sections 8.6(b)_
and _8.6(c)_ , then Buyer shall be responsible for all Employee Liabilities
for such Business Employees other than General Benefit Liabilities. For the
purposes of this Section 8.6, " _Seller Pro Rata Bonus Percentage_ " shall
mean a fraction, expressed as a percentage, that equals (i) the number of
calendar days elapsed during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
until (and including) the Closing Date, _divided_ by (ii) 365.

 



\- 56 -

    

(b) _Offer of Employment; Continuation of Employment_. Buyer shall offer
employment commencing on the Closing Date to all Business Employees and in
positions individually comparable to those in effect as of immediately prior
to the Closing, including those on vacation, military leave, leave of absence
(whether paid or unpaid, but excluding those who are either on approved short
term disability or have applied for short-term disability), disability or
layoff, on the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6(c)_. The term " _New
Buyer Employee_ " shall mean any Business Employee who accepts an employment
offer made by Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_. For any Business
Employee who is on short-term disability or who has applied for short term
disability at the Closing Date, the treatment as a New Buyer Employee may be
delayed until such Business Employee is cleared to return to active
employment, at which point such Business Employee shall be offered employment
with Buyer. Until such return date, to the extent consistent with the
Business Benefit Plans, any such Business Employee will remain on Sellers
short-term disability coverage, with any expenses for such coverage on and
after the Closing Date being charged to Buyer and promptly paid to Seller. If
a Business Employee is not able to return to work by the date that is six (6)
months after the Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_
shall not apply to such Business Employee and any employment with Buyer would
be as a new hire unless Buyer provides otherwise.

(c) _Compensation; Employee Benefits; Severance Plans_. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ or as otherwise required by applicable
law or the terms of the applicable Business Benefit Plan, the Business
Employees shall cease to participate in or accrue further benefits under the
Business Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. From and after
the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide each New Buyer Employee with base salary or base wages no less than
that in effect for such person immediately before the Closing. Buyer shall
provide each New Buyer Employee the same cash bonus opportunity for calendar
year 2018 that would have been afforded such New Buyer Employee under Sellers
cash bonus plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing (but without
giving effect to any forfeiture that would otherwise result from termination
of employment with Seller); ____provided that__ _,_ Buyer shall not be
required to provide bonuses related to Sellers corporate level cash bonus
plan that remain Sellers responsibility pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.6(a)(ii)_. From and after the Closing until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain (or cause its subsidiaries to maintain)
health and welfare and retirement plans and arrangements for the benefit of
each New Buyer Employee (" _Buyer_ _Welfare and Retirement_ _Plans_ ") that
provide benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
comparable benefits provided under Sellers vacation plan and the other
Business Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing with respect
to such New Buyer Employee (excluding equity awards, change in control pay or
benefits, nonqualified deferred compensation plans, and pension or other
defined benefit plans), and New Buyer Employees shall be admitted to such
Buyer Health and Welfare Plans as of the Closing, subject to the exception
provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.6(d)_. From and after the Closing until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain (or cause its
subsidiaries to maintain) a severance pay plan, program or practice for the
benefit of each New Buyer Employee that is no less favorable than the plan,
program or practice in effect immediately prior to the Closing with respect to
such New Buyer Employee, excluding equity or change in control pay or
benefits (" _Buyer Severance Plans_ ", and together with Buyer Welfare and
Retirement Plans, " _Buyer Plans_ "). For purposes of determining eligibility
to participate and vesting, and for purposes of vacation accrual and level
of severance benefits, service with Seller and its Affiliates (or predecessor
employers to the extent Seller or any Affiliates provides past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Buyer and its Affiliates under the Buyer
Plans and Buyer Severance Plans to the same extent such service was
recognized for such New Buyer Employee under the analogous Business Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Closing, except that Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not be required to recognize prior service if recognition of such prior
service would result in the duplication of benefits.

 



\- 57 -

    

(d) _Welfare Plans_. With respect to any Buyer Plan that is an "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) or any plan
directly or indirectly maintained or contributed to by Buyer providing similar
benefits to an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA), Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be
waived any waiting periods (other than to the extent any New Buyer Employee
has not completed such New Buyer Employees waiting periods under Sellers
plans), pre-existing condition limitations or actively-at-work requirements
and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, New Buyer Employees with respect to similar plans maintained Seller or
its Affiliates for New Buyer Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the use by New Buyer
Employees of any accrued benefits under any cafeteria plan (as defined in
Section 125 of the Code) which was maintained by Seller or its Affiliates for
such New Buyer Employees, subject to applicable law.

(e) _U.S. WARN Act, Etc_. Seller shall provide any required notice under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ ") and any other
similar applicable law and to otherwise comply with any such statute with
respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff (as defined in WARN) or
similar event affecting employees and occurring before the Closing Date. Buyer
shall provide any required notice under WARN and any other similar applicable
law and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant
closing" or "mass layoff WARN) or similar event affecting employees and
occurring on or after the Closing Date. From and after the Closing until the
date that is 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not terminate any
New Buyer Employee (other than for cause) in a manner that would trigger any
obligation under WARN.

 

(f) _U.S. COBRA_. Buyer shall provide any notice under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") or any other similar
applicable law required to be provided on or after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall assume all liabilities for post-employment health coverage under COBRA
or otherwise with respect to New Buyer Employees on and after the Closing
Date.

(g) _Right to Employment/Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein expressed
or implied (i) shall confer upon any of the Business Employees any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment, or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the
Agreement, (ii) is intended to confer on any person or entity other than the
Parties or their respective successors and assigns any third party beneficiary
or other rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ or any other provisions of this Agreement, or
(iii) shall amend any benefit plan, agreement, or arrangement of Buyer or
Seller.

 



\- 58 -

    

8.7 _Use of Name for Transition Period_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
Buyer shall have no rights to use any trademarks, tradenames, logos or any
contraction, abbreviation or simulation of Seller or any of its Affiliates(the
" _Retained Marks_ ") and will not hold itself out as having any affiliations
with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_, for a period of
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer may utilize sales
promotional aids, marketing literature and other printed marketing materials
included in the Acquired Assets transferred by Seller to Buyer on the Closing
Date and containing the Retained Marks subject to the following limitations:

(i) No such material may be used by Buyer on or after the Closing Date for any
purpose unless such material clearly and prominently displays the following
statement or a statement of similar import, the form of which shall be
approved by Seller:

 

"[Buyer product name], formerly a product of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"; and

 

(ii) promptly following the Closing Date, Buyer will implement a plan to
eliminate the use of all such material within such twelve (12) month period.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_, Buyer may
continue to use the Retained Marks for two (2) years following the Closing
Date on inventories of digital products existing on the Closing Date,
_provided_ that the products in such inventories are not modified or enhanced
in any manner.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_, Buyer may
continue to use the Retained Marks for two (2) years following the Closing
Date on inventories of physical products existing on the Closing Date,
_provided_ that the products in such inventories are not modified or enhanced
in any manner.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_, Buyer may
disclose to its customers and potential customers that it is conducting the
Business as a successor to Seller from and after the Closing Date.

(f) The licenses to use the Retained Marks set forth in this _Section_ __ _
8.7_ shall not prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from using the
Retained Marks (or any similar name or logo) during the term of the respective
license or thereafter in any manner. Buyer agrees that its use of the
Retained Marks shall be consistent with the past practices of Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with their business and operations and, with respect
to such use, Buyer shall adhere to quality standards substantially similar to
those of Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing.

8.8 _No Modification of R andW Policy_. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, amend, modify or otherwise change, terminate or waive any
provision of the RandW Policy (a) with respect to the waiver of subrogation set
forth therein, (b) in any manner that would be reasonably likely to increase
or expand the ability or rights of the Insurers to bring a claim, action, sui
or proceeding against, or otherwise seek recourse from the Seller, (c) in any
manner

 



\- 59 -

    

 that would be reasonably likely to reduce Buyers (or its Affiliates)
access to the RandW Policys coverage or cause any coverage provided under the
RandW Policy to be more difficult for Buyer (or its Affiliates) to access, or
(d) that would result in an increased retention or deductible under the RandW
Policy, in each case without the prior written consent of Seller.

(a) This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the other documents and instruments referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes
any prior statements, understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the Parties, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject

therein, made in connection herewith or therewith or as an inducement to enter
into this Agreement or any other Transaction Document) or any claim or cause
of action otherwise arising out of or related to the acquisition of the
Acquired Assets and the Business shall be those remedies available at law or
in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual remedies have been
further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents).

9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without limiting
anything set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, each party hereto agrees that
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York (except as expressly specified in the Debt
Financing, the commitment relating to any alternative financing or in any
definitive document related to such financing).

9.11 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
both Parties. No waiver granted under this Agreement shall be valid unless in
writing and signed by the Party to be charged. No waiver by a Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, _Sections 9.2_ , _9.3_ , _9.10_ , _9.15_ , _9.18_ and this _Section_
__ _ 9.11_ (and any provision (including any defined term therein) of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that adversely impacts in
any material respect the Financing Source without the prior written consent of
the Financing Source.

9.12 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

 



\- 63 -

    

9.13 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in
this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

9.14 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter. Each Party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

9.15 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court, (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of the other Party with
respect thereto. Either Party may make service on the other Party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.15_, however, shall affect the right of
either Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any lender named in a Debt Commitment Letter (or any such
lenders Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives
involved in the Debt Financing, and their respective successors and assigns)
under the Debt Commitment Letter in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York. The provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.15_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Financing Source, its Affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended
to be an express third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 9.15_.

 

9.16 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller will not comply with
the provisions of the bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any Damages arising
out of such noncompliance shall be deemed an Assumed Liability for all
purposes of this Agreement.

Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)

performance and enforcement of this Agreement, including any litigation
against the Financing Source arising out of this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letter.

September 12, 2018

 

Riverside Assessments, LLC

c/o Alpine Management Services III, LLC

Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 2320

San Francisco, CA 94111

Attention: Graham Weaver

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (as the same may be
amended, modified or restated in accordance with the terms thereof, the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, a Massachusetts corporation (" _Seller_
"), Riverside Assessments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _you_
" or " _Buyer_ "), and, solely for purposes of Sections 8.2 and 8.3 thereof,
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, a Delaware corporation. Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined in this letter shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

1\. We are pleased to advise you that (a) Alpine Investors VI, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (" _Alpine VI_ "), and Alpine VI-A Holdings Sub V, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Alpine  VI-A_", and, together with
Alpine VI, the " _Commitment Parties_ ", and each, a " _Commitment Party_ "),
hereby severally and not jointly, commits, conditioned solely upon (i) the
satisfaction, or waiver by Buyer (with the prior written approval of the
Commitment Parties) or Seller, as applicable, of all conditions precedent to
the obligations of Buyer and Seller to consummate the transactions to be
consummated at the Closing set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Purchase
Agreement at the time that the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) of the Purchase Agreement (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing, but subject to
those conditions being capable of being satisfied at such time) ( _provided_
that this condition shall not apply with respect to amounts required to be
paid by Buyer pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 4.6(a) of the
Purchase Agreement, subject to the other terms and conditions hereof), and
(ii) the contemporaneous consummation of the Closing (assuming the funding of
the Commitment), to contribute to Buyer as equity, at or prior to the Closing
(or solely with respect to amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to
the penultimate sentence of Section 4.6(a) of the Purchase Agreement, the
termination of the Purchase Agreement, _provided_  that the maximum amount
payable pursuant to this parenthetical shall be $5 million), in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this letter,
directly or indirectly, an aggregate amount up to its Pro Rata Percentage
(as defined below) of $145,000,000 (the " _Commitment_ ") in cash in
immediately available funds (subject to any reduction in accordance with the
terms set forth in the immediately following sentence), it being understood
and agreed that neither Commitment Party shall, under any circumstances, be
obligated under this letter to (or be obligated to cause any other person or
entity to) contribute to, purchase equity (directly or indirectly) from or
otherwise provide funds to Buyer (or any other person or entity in respect of
the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement) in an amount in
excess of its Pro Rata Percentage of the Commitment. The proceeds of the
Commitment shall be used by Buyer solely to satisfy its obligations to pay
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement, the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations contemplated by Section 4.6(a),
Section 8.5(b) and Section 9.13 of the Purchase Agreement, any obligations to
pay fees and expenses of Buyer related to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement. The amount of the Commitment may be reduced by
Buyer (i) in an amount specified by Buyer solely to the extent it will be
possible, notwithstanding such reduction, for Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in

    

September 12, 2018

 

Page 2



 

 accordance with the terms thereof, and/or (ii) on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the amount of any third-party financing obtained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Commitment shall not be reduced pursuant to clause (i) unless and until
funding sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement is received by Buyer and (B) the Commitment shall not be reduced
pursuant to clause (ii) unless and until such third party financing is funded
at the Closing.

 

The " _Pro Rata Percentage_ " for each Commitment Party is as set forth below:

 



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    

Alpine VI

 |  |  | 94.95 | % 
  

Alpine VI-A

 |  |  | 5.05 | % 
 

2\. Except as set forth in paragraph 4 below, the Commitment is solely for the
benefit of Buyer and is not intended (expressly or impliedly) to confer any
benefits on, or create any rights in favor of, any other person or entity.
Nothing set forth in this letter contains or gives, or shall be construed to
contain or to give, any person or entity (other than the Commitment Parties,
Buyer and Seller), including any person or entity acting in a representative
capacity, any remedies under or by reason of, or any rights to enforce or
cause Buyer to enforce, the commitments set forth herein, nor shall anything
in this letter be construed, to confer any rights, legal or equitable, in any
person or entity other than the Commitment Parties, Buyer and Seller. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the creditors of the Commitment Parties, Buyer
or any of their Affiliates (other than Seller) shall have any direct or
indirect right to enforce this letter or to cause Buyer to enforce this
letter.

 

3\. Each Commitment Partys several, and not joint, obligation to fund its Pro
Rata Percentage of the Commitment will terminate and expire on the earliest
to occur of (i) immediately following the Closing and payment of the Purchase
Price to Seller in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (ii)
the valid termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof, or (iii) the date on which any claim is brought by Seller or any of
its Affiliates under, or legal action, suit or proceeding is initiated by
Seller or any of its Affiliates against any Commitment Party or any Non-
Recourse Buyer Party (as defined below) in connection with this letter, the
Purchase Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or
otherwise relating thereto (other than in respect of a claim for specific
performance under and in accordance with the terms of this letter, a claim
against Alpine Management Services III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, under the Confidentiality Agreement and/or, for the avoidance of
doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a claim
against Buyer under the Purchase Agreement (such earliest date, the "
_Commitment Expiration Date_ "). From and after the Commitment Expiration
Date, neither the Commitment Parties nor any Non-Recourse Buyer Party shall
have any further liability or obligation to any person or entity hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, such termination
shall not, in and of itself, relieve any person or entity of any liability or
obligation it may have under the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (x) any claim by Seller arising out of a breach of
this letter shall survive any termination of the Commitment until the final
and non-appealable resolution of such claim in a court of competent
jurisdiction and satisfaction of such claim as directed by such court (but
such claim shall terminate if Seller fails to commence litigation with respect
thereto in a court of competent jurisdiction within ninety (90) days following
the Commitment Expiration Date), (y) if the Purchase Agreement is terminated
in accordance with the terms thereof, the Commitment shall, to the

    

September 12, 2018

 

Page 3



 

 extent related to amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to the
penultimate sentence of Section 4.6(a) of the Purchase Agreement, remain in
full force and effect until such amounts are so paid (but the Commitment
shall, to the extent related to such amounts, terminate if Seller fails to
commence litigation with respect thereto in a court of competent jurisdiction
within ninety (90) days following the Commitment Expiration Date), (
_provided_ that the maximum amount payable pursuant to this clause (y) shall
be $5 million) and (z) in the event that the Closing occurs, Seller shall not
be entitled to commence any litigation referred to in the foregoing clauses
(x) or (y) following the Closing.

4\. This letter shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Buyer and
the Commitment Parties. Each Commitment Party, severally and not jointly,
acknowledges that Seller is an express third party beneficiary hereof
(including, without limitation, with respect to such Commitment Partys
representations in each of paragraphs 12 and 13 below), entitled, subject to
Section 6 hereof, without limiting its other rights and remedies, to
specifically enforce the several, and not joint, obligations of each
Commitment Party against such Commitment Party to the full extent hereof in
connection with Sellers exercise of its rights under and in accordance with
Section 9.14 of the Purchase Agreement and, in connection therewith, Seller
has the right to an injunction, or other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, to cause Buyer to cause, or to
directly cause, each Commitment Party to severally, and not jointly, fund,
directly or indirectly, its Pro Rata Percentage of the Commitment as, and only
to the extent permitted by, this letter, in the case of any obligation to
fund the Commitment, when all of the conditions to funding the Commitment set
forth in paragraph 1 hereof have been satisfied and as otherwise contemplated
by the exercise of Sellers rights under Section 9.14 of the Purchase
Agreement. Each Commitment Party accordingly severally, and not jointly,
agrees, subject in all respects to Section 9.14 of the Purchase Agreement, not
to oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that Seller has an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Each Commitment Party further severally, and not
jointly, agrees, that Seller shall not be required to post a bond or
undertaking in connection with such order or injunction or other equitable
relief sought in accordance with the terms of Section 9.14 of the Purchase
Agreement. Each Commitment Party, severally, and not jointly, acknowledges
and agrees that (a) Buyer is delivering a copy of this letter to Seller and
that Seller is relying on the several, and not joint, obligations and
commitments of the Commitment Parties hereunder in connection with Sellers
decision to enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, (b) the availability of monetary damages in the Purchase
Agreement (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of the Purchase Agreement or a breach of
such Commitment Partys obligations to fund the Commitment in accordance with
the terms of this letter and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect Sellers right to specific enforcement, to
cause Buyer to cause, or to directly cause, such Commitment Party to
severally, and not jointly, fund, directly or indirectly, the Commitment under
this letter, and to cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement under Section 9.14 of the Purchase Agreement and (c)
the right of specific performance under this letter and Section 9.14 of the
Purchase Agreement are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement and without those rights, Seller would not have entered
into the Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the remedies
available to Seller under Section 9.14 of the Purchase Agreement and this
letter shall be in addition to any other remedy to which Seller is entitled,
and the election to pursue any injunction or specific performance under
Section 9.14 of the Purchase Agreement shall not limit or impair Sellers
right to exercise any other right or remedy; _provided_ , _however_ that,
under no circumstance shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both
(x) a grant of 

    

September 12, 2018

 

Page 4



 

 specific performance in respect of any breach of the Commitment and (y) any
money damages in respect of such breach. Except for the rights of Seller as an
express third party beneficiary of this letter, on the terms, and subject to
the conditions hereof, nothing in this letter, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any person or entity other than Buyer and the Commitment
Parties and Seller any rights or remedies under, or by reason of, or any
rights to enforce or cause Buyer to enforce, the Commitment or any provisions
of this letter or to confer upon any person or entity any rights or remedies
against any person or entity other than the Commitment Parties under or
by reason of this letter. Without limiting the foregoing, no person or entity
(other than Buyer or Seller, but in the case of Seller, only on the terms, and
subject to the limitations, set forth in this paragraph and Section 9.14 of
the Purchase Agreement, as applicable) shall have any right to specifically
enforce this letter or to cause Buyer to specifically enforce this letter.

 

5\. None of the Commitment Parties, Buyer or Seller may assign their
respective rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other person or
entity (except by operation of law) without the prior written consent of
Seller (in the case of an assignment by any Commitment Party or Buyer) or the
Commitment Parties (in the case of an assignment by Seller), and any attempted
assignment without such required consents shall be null and void and of no
force or effect. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of
this letter shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and Seller and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

6\. Sellers rights under this letter and Sellers remedies against Buyer
under the Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or any
License Agreement and/or against Alpine Management Services III, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be, and are intended to be, the sole and exclusive direct or indirect rights
of and remedies available to Seller or any of its Affiliates against (i) the
Commitment Parties or Buyer and (ii) any former, current and future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of the Commitment Parties or Buyer or any former, current or future
equity holder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent, advisor or assignee of any
of the foregoing (other than the Commitment Parties to the extent provided in
this letter and Buyer to the extent provided in the Purchase Agreement,
the Transition Services Agreement or any License Agreement) (those persons
and entities described in clause (ii), excluding the Commitment Parties and
Buyer, each being referred to as a " _Non-Recourse Buyer Party_") in respect
of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this
letter or the Purchase Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
paragraph, but without limiting Sellers other rights and remedies, Seller, as
the express third party beneficiary hereunder on the terms, and subject to the
conditions, set forth in paragraph 4 of this letter, may cause Buyer to, or
to directly, cause the Commitment to be funded as, and only to the extent,
permitted by the exercise of Sellers rights under Section 9.14 of the
Purchase Agreement or on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth
in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this letter. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this letter, each of Buyer and Seller, by its
acceptance, directly or indirectly, of the benefits of this letter, covenants,
agrees and acknowledges that no recourse hereunder, under the Purchase
Agreement or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection
herewith or therewith shall be had against any Non-Recourse Buyer Party,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, or by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Seller against any Non-Recourse Buyer
Party, whether by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any

    

September 12, 2018

 

Page 5



 

 statute, regulation or other applicable law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Recourse Buyer Party in connection with
this letter, the Purchase Agreement or any documents or instrument delivered
in connection herewith or therewith or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

7\. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this letter
or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, Buyer
covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no person or entity other than the
Commitment Parties shall have any obligation hereunder and that no recourse
hereunder or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection
herewith or therewith shall be had against, and no personal liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-
Recourse Buyer Party for any obligations of the Commitment Parties under this
letter or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of any such
obligations or their creation, through Buyer or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of Buyer or Seller against any Non-Recourse Buyer Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise. Subject to
their respective several, and not joint, obligations to fund the Commitment,
under no circumstances shall the Commitment Parties be liable to Seller or any
other person or entity for consequential, punitive, exemplary, multiple,
special or similar damages, or for lost profits.

8\. This letter, the Purchase Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
reflect the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other, and
supersedes each other, agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof with
respect to such subject matter. This letter may not be waived, amended or
modified except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto and Seller. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect
to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair
the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any
other time. The waiver by any of the parties hereto or Seller of a breach of
or a default under any of the provisions of this letter or a failure to or
delay in exercising any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver
of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. No failure or
delay by any party or Seller in exercising any right or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, neither this letter nor the Commitment shall be effective unless
there has been prior or concurrent execution and delivery of the Purchase
Agreement by each of the parties thereto.

9\. This letter shall be treated as confidential and is being provided to
Buyer and Seller solely in connection with their execution of the Purchase
Agreement. This letter may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise
referred to in any document, except with the prior written consent of the
undersigned or as required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller may disclose this letter (i) to the extent required by the
applicable rules of any national securities exchange or required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") in connection with any SEC
filings relating to the Closing, (ii) by interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process or (iii) in connection with enforcing
this letter.

10\. This letter and any action (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that
may be directly or indirectly based upon, relating to arising out of this
letter, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to paragraph 11 below, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Commitments, this
letter or any of the transactions contemplated by this letter: (i) each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this paragraph 10 shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall

upgrades, modifications, in each case, to the content thereof, or new versions
of the content of the foregoing.

1.2 " _Ancillary Patents_ " means any patents or patent applications that (a)
Licensor and its Affiliates own or control (with the right to sublicense at
no additional cost to Licensor) as of the Closing (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement), (b) that Licensor or its Affiliates file within three
years following the Closing that claim inventions reduced to practice by
employees of Licensor or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, and (c)
reissues, re-examinations, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions,
extensions or other counterpart patents and legal protections arising from
such patents and patent applications after the Effective Date.



   

1.3 " _Business Day_ " means any calendar day other than (a) a Saturday
or Sunday or (b) a calendar day on which banking institutions located in
Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by law, executive order or
governmental decree to remain closed.

 

1.4 " _Business Field_ " means the business of developing, publishing,
marketing, licensing and selling clinical and educational assessment products
and services.

1.5 " _Business Patents_ " means the patents and patent applications listed on
_Exhibit A _ hereto, as well as all reissues, re-examinations, continuations,
continuations-in-part, divisions, extensions or other counterpart patents and
legal protections arising from such patents and patent applications at any
time before or after the Effective Date.

 

1.6 " _Business Products_ " has the meaning attributed to it in the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

 

1.7 " _Licensed Other IPR_ " means all Other IPR that is used in or held for
use in the operation of, or incorporated into, the Business as of the
Effective Date, but is not transferred to Licensee pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

1.8 " _Licensed Patents_ " means the Business Patents and the Ancillary
Patents.

1.9 " _Other IPR_ " means all rights in (i) trade secrets, confidential
information, and other know-how; (ii) software, software documentation, and
software manuals; and (iii) data, databases and data collections, in each case
owned or controlled by Licensor (with the right to sublicense at no
additional cost to Licensor).

2\. _LICENSE; COVENANT NOT TO SUE; PROPRIETARY RIGHTS_. 

2.1 _License Grant to Business Patents._ During the Term, the applicable
Licensor Entity hereby grants Licensee an irrevocable (subject to termination
under Section 3.3 below), non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
worldwide license (without the right to sublicense except as set forth in
Section 2.6 below) under the Business Patents to make, have made, use, import,
offer to sell and sell products and offer services in the Business Field.

 

2.2 _Covenant Not to Sue with Respect to Ancillary Patents_. During the Term,
the applicable Licensor Entity hereby covenants and irrevocably (subject to
termination under Section 3.3 below) agrees that it shall not directly or

defense, offset, counterclaim, cross-claim or pleading or other proceeding of
any sort whatsoever, or make any allegations against (i) Licensee, (ii) its
Affiliates, (iii) third parties with respect to the provision of services on
Licensees behalf, (iv) resellers and distributors in connection with
the resale or distribution of Licensees products or services, and (v)
customers in connection with such customers use of Licensees and services
asserting that the making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing of

2.3 _License to Other IPR_. The Applicable Licensor Entity hereby grants
Licensee an irrevocable (subject to termination under Section 3.3 below),
perpetual (subject to termination under Section 3.3 below), exclusive, non-

sublicense) under the Licensed Other IPR to use, offer to sell, sell, create
derivative works of, modify, copy, reproduce, distribute, perform and display
products and services, and otherwise operate a business in, the Business
Field. To the extent any of the rights granted under this Section 2.3 are
sublicensed by Licensor to Licensee pursuant to rights granted to Licensor
under an agreement with a third party, such rights shall survive only for as
long as Licensor has the right to grant such sublicenses. For the avoidance
of doubt, Licensor shall have no obligation to deliver to Licensee any
documents or other materials that describe or otherwise embody any of the
Licensed Other IPR.

 

2.4 _Reservation of Rights._ Licensee acknowledges that the applicable
Licensor Entity retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Licensed
Patents and Licensed Other IPR.

Licensees products or services, and (iv) customers in connection with such
customers use of Licensees products and services.

 

3\. _TERM AND TERMINATION_.

3.1  _Term._ This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless
earlier terminated pursuant to Sections 3.2 or 3.3 below, shall expire on the
expiration date of the last of the Licensed Patents to expire.

 

3.2 _Termination for Convenience._ Licensee may terminate this Agreement at
any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to Licensor.

3.3 _Termination for Cause_. If either Party materially breaches this
Agreement and the breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days
after the non-breaching Party notifies the breaching Party in writing of the
breach, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of such
thirty (30) day period.

3.4 _Effect of Termination._ Upon any termination (but not expiration) of this
Agreement all licenses to the Licensed Patents set forth in this Agreement
shall terminate and Licensee shall have no further rights under the Licensed
Patents except to the extent arising under applicable law. Section 2.3
survives any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 

4\. REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES. Licensor represents and warrants that it has the
corporate authority to grant the rights, licenses and covenants set forth in
this Agreement. OTHERWISE, THE LICENSED PATENTS AND LICENSED OTHER IPR ARE
PROVIDED

 



3

    

 "AS IS" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. LICENSOR HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATED TO THE LICENSED
PATENTS AND LICENSED OTHER IPR, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 

5\. CONFIDENTIALITY. Licensee shall hold in trust and maintain, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement), consultants and advisors to hold in trust and
maintain, in strict confidence, in the same manner as held by Licensor
immediately prior to Closing (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) all
Licensed Other IPR. The obligations in the preceding sentence shall not apply
to (a) information which becomes generally available to the public other than
by disclosure in violation of the provisions of this Section 5, (b)
information which becomes available on a non-confidential basis to Licensee
from a source other than Licensor or any of its Affiliates provided that such
source is not, to Licensees knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality
to Licensor, any of its Affiliates or any other party with respect to such
information, and (c) information acquired or developed independently by
Licensee without violating this Agreement or any other confidentiality
agreement with Licensor or any of its Affiliates. Licensee may disclose
Confidential Information to the extent that Licensee reasonably believes doing
so is required by law, provided that it first notifies Licensor of such
requirement and allows Licensor a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure. Without
prejudice to the rights and remedies of either Party, Licensor and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of an injunction if
the Licensee breaches or threatens to breach any provision of this Section 5\.

6.  _MISCELLANEOUS_.

6.1 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided by applicable law, this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity
other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

6.2  _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Licensee may not assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of Licensor, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall
be null and void; provided, however, that Licensee may assign this Agreement
without such prior written consent (a) in whole, in connection with a sale of
all or substantially all of the business or assets of Licensee to which this
Agreement relates, or (b) in part, in connection with a sale of a portion of
the business or assets of Licensee, in each case whether by merger,
reorganization, or sale of assets or equity, whether on a stand-alone basis or
as part of a larger transaction involving one or more of Licensees
affiliates.

requests, demands, claims and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

 

6.4 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by both
Parties. No waiver granted under this Agreement shall be valid unless in
writing and signed by the Party to be charged. No waiver by a Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

 



5

    

6.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

 

6.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in
this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.7  _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the
United States of America or any state or jurisdiction thereof have
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter. Each Party agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

6.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware.

 

6.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court,
(c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of the other Party with respect
thereto. Either Party may make service on the other Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 6.3 above.
Nothing in this Section 6.9, however, shall affect the right of either Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

 



6

    

6.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

6.11 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to
the other Party, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile or by
an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

5.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate

cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware.

 

5.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court,

motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of the other Party with respect

Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
expedited courier, messenger service, telex or ordinary mail), but no such
notice, request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to have

shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by both
Parties. No waiver granted under this Agreement shall be valid unless in
writing and signed by the Party to be charged. No waiver by a Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

 

5.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other

of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the

provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

5.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in
this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including

United States of America or any state or jurisdiction thereof have
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter. Each Party agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has an
adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

5.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this

or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware.

 

5.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court,
(c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of the other Party with respect
thereto. Either Party may make service on the other Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 5.3 above.
Nothing in this Section 5.9, however, shall affect the right of either Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

5.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

5.11 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to
the other Party, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile or by
an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

   

EXHIBIT I 

 

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made this [] day
of [], 2018, by and between Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, a
Massachusetts corporation (" _Seller_ "), and Riverside Assessments, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "). Seller and Buyer are
together referred to herein as the " _Parties_ ," and each individually as a
" _Party_."

WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and, solely for purposes of Sections 8.2 and 8.3
thereof, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, a Delaware corporation, are
parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 12, 2018 (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in order to enable Buyer to operate the Business in an effective
manner, Seller has agreed to provide to Buyer certain services for the
periods and on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants
set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Parties agree:

 

1.1 _General_. During the term of this Agreement Seller (or an Affiliate of
Seller designated by Seller for this purpose) shall provide, or cause such
designated Affiliate to provide, the services (individually, a " _Service_ "
and collectively, the " _Services_ ") set forth in _Schedule A_ attached
hereto for 18 months (solely with respect to Services IT1, IT3, IT6, IT8 and
IT18) one year (for all other Services) from the date hereof. Buyer may
request during the term of this Agreement that Seller additionally provide any
other service that Seller provided for the benefit of the Business during the
twelve-month period immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Baseline Period_
") in the ordinary course of business. If Buyer requests that Seller provide
any such service, the Parties shall amend _Schedule A_ hereto to add such
service as a Service; _provided_ that (i) the term for such additional Service
shall expire on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (provided
that if such additional Service is substantially similar to the
Services identified in IT5 and IT8, then the term for such Service shall
expire on the date that is 18 months after the date of this Agreement) and
(ii) such amendment to Schedule A shall specify that as the fee for such
additional Service, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to Buyers
total cost to provide such additional Service.

1.2 _Cooperation_. Each Party shall cause its employees to use good faith
efforts to cooperate with employees of the other to the extent required for
effective and timely delivery of the Services, including by exchanging
information (in accordance with Section 3.1 below) and performing
reconciliations and adjustments. In addition, each Party shall name a point of
contact (a " _Transition Manager_ ") who shall be responsible for the day to
day implementation of this Agreement, including attempted resolution of any
issues that may arise during the performance of either Partys obligations
hereunder. Subject to the right to delegate duties to others, the

 



I-1

    

 Transition Managers will serve as the primary contact point for the
respective principals with respect to the obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement. Each Transition Managers responsibilities will include: (a)
conducting reviews of compliance with the performance standards set forth in
this Agreement and Schedule A hereto (as applicable), (b) assisting with
compliance with this Agreement, including _Schedule A_  hereto, and (c)
assisting with mitigating and resolving technical and business issues. A Party
may designate a replacement for its Transition Manager by notice to the other
Party. In addition, between the date of the Purchase Agreement and Closing
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement), Seller will, following consultation
with Buyer, identify, on a subject by subject basis, a specific individual who
will serve as point of contact for such subject.

 

1.3 _Third Party Services_. Seller shall have the right to engage the services
of third parties to deliver or assist in the delivery of the Services
contemplated under this Agreement to the extent (a) reasonably required or
advisable in the ordinary course of Sellers business, (b) engagement is
consistent with (i) Sellers use of third parties to deliver such Services to
the Business during the Baseline Period or (ii) Sellers own use of similar
services or those provided to its subsidiaries or (c) consented to by Buyer
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
so long as (x) in the case of the foregoing clauses (a) or (b)(ii), Buyer is
provided reasonably advance notice of such engagement, and (y) all costs and
expenses associated with such engagement, including those incurred by Buyer,
are borne by Seller; provided that nothing in this Section 1.3 shall relieve
Buyer of any obligation to make any payment pursuant to Section 2 below and
_Schedule_ A hereto. Seller will impose on such third parties
customary confidentiality obligations. If Seller engages the services of a
third party pursuant to this Section 1.3, then Seller will be and remain
responsible and liable for any acts or omissions of any such third party
(including failure to perform in accordance with this Agreement) to the same
extent as if such acts or omissions were committed by Seller or a Seller
employee.

1.4  _Resources_. Seller represents and warrants that, as of Closing, it has
suitable employees on-site or otherwise available to perform the Services to
be performed by it hereunder. During the term of this Agreement, Seller will
maintain sufficient resources to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and any Schedule. The Parties agree that in no event shall Seller be required
to hire employees or engage consultants or contractors for the purpose of
performing Services hereunder.

1.5 _Standard of Performance_. Seller shall provide all Services with not
materially less care, skill, quality and diligence than Seller used in
providing such services for the benefit of the Business during the Baseline
Period.

1.6  _Software_. To the extent any Services involve access to database or
other software systems (including any SAP applications), neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any liability for any data entry errors,
database errors, software bugs or errors, data stored or accessed by such
systems or otherwise in any way relating to Buyers use of such software
applications or systems.

 



I-2

    

1.7 _Conflict for Services_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including _Schedule A_ , Seller shall not be required to
provide any Services hereunder that may result in the breach or violation of
any applicable law or any arrangement or agreement with any third party,
including software licenses and support or maintenance agreements. Seller
will provide notice to Buyer of any Service that Seller is not required to
provide pursuant to this Section 1.7 promptly after becoming aware thereof.

 

1.8 _Relationship with Seller_. Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing
Buyer shall not hold itself out as having any affiliations with Seller,
including in connection with Buyers dealings with vendors. Buyer shall have
no right to participate in or suggest the applicability of any volume
discounts that Seller may have with any service provider or other third party.

 

2\. PAYMENTS

2.1 _Fees and Third Party Costs and Expenses Reimbursement_. _Schedule A_
indicates the monthly (or other) fee for each Service. Each such monthly fee
shall be prorated on a daily basis in accordance with the number of days in
such calendar month for any partial calendar month during which such Service
is provided. If Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs costs or expenses on
behalf of Buyer as well as other businesses operated by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the provision of any Services that  _Schedule
A_ hereto provides will be billed to Buyer on a pass-through basis, Seller
will allocate any such costs or expenses on a pro rata basis based on Buyers
proportional share of its use of such Services, as determined in good
faith by Seller. Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
keep and maintain such books and records as may be reasonably necessary to
make such allocations. Seller shall make copies of such books and records
available to Buyer for inspection upon request and with reasonable notice.

2.2 _Invoicing and Payment_. Within twenty (20) days following the end
of each calendar month during the term hereof, Seller shall provide to Buyer
a single invoice (an " _Invoice_ ") setting forth the aggregate fees for all
Services for such month. Such Invoice shall list each Service and the fee for
such Service for such month. No later than thirty (30) days following receipt
of an Invoice, Buyer shall pay all undisputed amounts due under such Invoice
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller. Buyers failure to pay any undisputed amounts set forth in an Invoice
within such 30-day period shall be considered a material breach of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2(a) below. Every Invoice that is not paid
when due shall bear interest on all undisputed amounts from and after the date
on which such Invoice first became overdue at an annual rate equal to twelve
percent (12%). Buyer agrees to pay on demand all costs of
collection, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by Seller in
collecting any such Invoice.

2.3 _Taxes_. The fees payable pursuant to this Section 2 shall be exclusive
of any federal, state, municipal, or other U.S. or foreign government taxes,
duties, excises, tariffs, fees, assessments or levies now or hereinafter
imposed on the performance or delivery of Services or direct costs. Any
taxes, duties, excises, tariffs, fees, assessments or levies imposed on the
performance or delivery of Services or direct costs hereunder that are
required to be collected from Buyer by Seller under applicable law shall
be separately stated on the applicable Invoice and shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence
shall not apply to any taxes, duties, excises, tariffs, fees, assessments or
levies based (in whole or in part) on net income or profits.

 



I-3

    

3\. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF DATA

 

3.1 _Information Exchanges_. Subject to applicable law and good faith claims
of privilege, each Party shall provide the other Party with all information
regarding itself and the transactions under this Agreement that the other
Party reasonably believes is required to comply with all applicable laws,
ordinances, regulations and codes in connection with the provision of
Services pursuant to this Agreement or to otherwise receive the full benefit
of the Services. This Agreement does not provide rights to either Party to
access, store or use information of the other Party or its Affiliates that is
not or was not related to such other Partys business. Each Party agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts not to access such information. Upon request
of either Party, the other Party shall promptly return and/or destroy any
copies of any reports, data, or other information relating to the requesting
Party.

3.2 _Confidential Information_. Each Party shall hold in trust and maintain,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates,
consultants and advisors to hold in trust and maintain, in strict confidence
all Confidential Information relating to the other Party. " _Confidential
Information_ " shall mean all information disclosed by either Party to the
other in connection with this Agreement that is, given the circumstances and
nature of disclosure, reasonably likely to be considered confidential by the
disclosing Party, and includes, but is not limited to, economic, scientific,
technical, product and business data, business plans, customer information and
data (including Personal Data) and the like, but shall not include (a)
information which becomes generally available to the public other than by
disclosure in violation of the provisions of this Section 3.2, (b) information
which becomes available on a non-confidential basis to a Party from a source
other than the other Party provided that such source is not, to the receiving
Partys knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the
Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, and (c)
information acquired or developed independently by a Party without violating
this Section 3.2 or any other confidentiality agreement with the other Party.
A Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such Party
reasonably believes doing so is required by law, provided that it first
notifies the other Party of such requirement and allows such Party a
reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
to prevent such disclosure. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies of
either Party, a Party disclosing any Confidential Information to the other
Party in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be entitled to
equitable relief by way of an injunction if the other Party breaches or
threatens to breach any provision of this Section 3.2. Seller may, in its sole
discretion, update its hardware, software or administrative tools, including
those that relate to the Business. 

3.3 _Security_. Each Party hereby acknowledges that the other Party retains
the right to use reasonable measures and take reasonable steps to protect the
confidentiality and security of its network and data, including as may be
shared by the other Party, on and after the Closing.

 



I-4

    

3.4 _Personal Data_. With respect to any Personal Data, Seller and those of
its Affiliates providing Services will, in connection with the provision of
Services, (a) use the same level of efforts to comply with applicable Privacy
Laws with respect to Personal Data as Seller used in providing the Services to
the Business during the Baseline Period; (b) use reasonable efforts to
maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all Personal Data
processed or maintained by Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the
Services; and (c) except to the extent consistent in all material respects
with practice for the Business during the Baseline Period, not transfer
Personal Data to, or store or otherwise process Personal Data in, a geographic
location outside of the continental United States without Buyers prior
written consent. All Personal Data processed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Services will, as between the Parties, be
Confidential Information of Buyer, notwithstanding any exceptions to
the definition of Confidential Information in Section 3.2.

3.5 _Disaster Recovery; Backup_ _._ During __ the term of this Agreement (as
provided in Section 5.1 below), Seller will, and will cause those of its
Affiliates providing Services to, maintain backup, business continuation and
disaster recovery plans and measures with respect to the Services
materially consistent with those applied by Seller to its business.

4\. INDEMNIFICATION

 

4.1 _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates harmless against any damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) arising from (i) the gross negligence or

by Seller of any of its obligations hereunder.

(b) _Defense_. If notified promptly in writing of any action brought against
Buyer or its Affiliates based on a claim described in Section 4.1(a) above,
Seller shall defend such action at its expense and pay all costs, damages and
settlements finally awarded in such action or settlement which are
attributable to such claim. Seller shall have sole control of the defense of
any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise,
provided such settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release of
Buyer and its Affiliates from all liability with respect to such claim in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller in the defense of such claim, and may be represented, at
Buyers expense, by counsel of Buyers selection.

 

4.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Affiliates harmless against (i) any damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) arising from (A) the gross negligence or
intentional misconduct of Buyer in connection with its receipt or use of any
Services, or (B) the material breach by Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder; and (ii) any third-party damages, costs and expenses
arising from the receipt or use of the Services (except to the extent any such
third-party damages, costs and expenses result from the provision of such

(b) _Defense_. If notified promptly in writing of any action brought against
Seller or its Affiliates based on a claim described in Section 4.2(a) above,
Buyer shall defend such action at its expense and pay all costs and damages
finally awarded in such action or settlement which are attributable to such
claim. Buyer shall have sole control of the defense of any such action and
all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, provided such settlement or
compromise includes an unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates from
all liability with respect to such claim in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in the
defense of such claim, and may be represented, at Sellers expense, by counsel
of Sellers selection.

 

5\. TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1 _Term_. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 5.2 below,
this Agreement shall be in effect from the date hereof until termination of
the last of the Services provided hereunder.

 

5.2 _Termination_.

(a) This Agreement or any individual Service(s) may be terminated by either
Party if the other Party (the " _Defaulting Party_ ") has materially breached
its obligations under this Agreement and if the Defaulting Party has not cured
such default within twenty (20) days following the date on which the other
Party (the " _Notifying Party_ ") has given written notice specifying the
facts constituting the default. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this
Agreement shall not be terminated due to a default by the Defaulting Party if
such default is directly attributable to a breach of this Agreement by the
Notifying Party.

 

(b) The Parties may terminate this Agreement with respect to any particular
Service for any reason upon the mutual written agreement of the Parties.

(c) Buyer may terminate any individual Service(s), or all Services, to be
provided to Buyer hereunder for any or no reason by providing Seller not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice setting forth the termination date
for the Service(s). With respect to the termination of individual Service(s),
beginning on the termination date for such Service(s), Buyers obligation to
pay the Service Costs corresponding to such terminated Service(s) will cease
to accrue.

(d) Termination of any Service shall relieve Seller of its obligations to
provide the remaining Services to the extent that such remaining Services are
dependent on the terminated Service and Seller has informed Buyer of such
inter-dependencies no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of Buyers
notice of termination for a Service.

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall cease and be of no
further force or effect, except that the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 above,
and Buyers obligation to pay any Invoice for Services provided prior to
the effective date of any termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall
survive any such termination or expiration.

 



I-6

    

6\. GENERAL

 

6.1 _Assignment_. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. No such
assignment shall relieve either Party of its obligations hereunder.
This Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of the Parties and each
of their Affiliates directly involved with the Services, and all rights of
either Party under this Agreement may be exercised by any such Affiliate of
such Party. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
any successors or permitted assigns of the Parties.

6.2 _Force Majeure_. Neither Party shall bear any responsibility or liability
for any Damages arising out of any delay, inability to perform or interruption
of its performance of its obligations under this Agreement due to any acts or
omissions of the other Party or for events beyond its reasonable control
including acts of God, acts of governmental authorities, acts of the public
enemy or due to war, riot, flood, civil commotion, insurrection, labor
difficulty, severe or adverse weather conditions, lack of or shortage
of electrical power, malfunctions of equipment or software programs, or any
other cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (each, an " _Event_
"); provided, that Seller will not be excused pursuant to this Section 6.2 if,
and solely to the extent, it has failed to implement its then effective and
applicable backup, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, except to
the extent that the Event has rendered such programs inoperable or
ineffective. Upon the occurrence of any such Event that results in, or will
result in, delay or failure to perform under this Agreement, (a) the Party
experiencing the Event will promptly after becoming aware thereof notify the
other Party of such occurrence and, to the extent then known, the effect
and/or, to the extent reasonably possible, the anticipated effect of such
occurrence and (b) Buyer will not be obligated to pay for any portion of the
Services not delivered as a result of such occurrence. The Party experiencing
the Event will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions in
its performance and to resume performance of its obligations under this
Agreement as soon as the Event (and the aftermath of the Event) no longer
precludes it from rendering such performance, including by implementing its
then effective and applicable backup, disaster recovery and business
continuity plans.

 

6.3 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States
of America or any state or jurisdiction thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has an adequate remedy at law
or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

6.4 _Applicable Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement and all claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in

 



I-7

    

 or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of Delaware. Each Party (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New
Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court
sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court, (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any other court. Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of the other Party with
respect thereto. Either Party may make service on the other Party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 6.8 below.
Nothing in this Section 6.4, however, shall affect the right of either Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, each Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights
to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of either Party in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Relationship of the Parties_. The Parties shall for all purposes be
considered independent contractors with respect to each other, and neither
shall be considered an employee, employer, agent, principal, partner or joint
venturer of the other.

6.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto) and the Purchase Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
statements, understandings, agreements or representations by or between the
Parties, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and the Parties specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior statements,
understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not expressly
embodied in this Agreement.

6.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by both Parties.
No waiver granted under this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and
signed by the Party to be charged. No waiver by a Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.

6.8 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing. Any notice, request,
demand, claim or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly delivered
(a) four (4) Business Days after it is sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (b) one Business Day after it is
sent

POLICY

(BUYER VERSION)

 

THIS POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO ANY BREACH THAT THE INSURED FIRST DISCOVERS PRIOR
TO THE END OF THE POLICY TERM AND THAT IS REPORTED TO THE INSURERS
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF SECTION IV(D) OF THIS POLICY. THE LIMIT OF LIABILITY
AVAILABLE TO PAY LOSS SHALL BE REDUCED BY AMOUNTS INCURRED AS COVERED COSTS TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH COVERED COSTS ARE PAID BY THE INSURERS TO THE INSURED
HEREUNDER. THIS POLICY DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR ANY DUTY BY THE INSURERS TO
DEFEND THE INSURED IN ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM PROVIDED THAT THE INSURERS SHALL
PAY COVERED COSTS INCURRED BY THE INSURED IN ANY SUCH DEFENSE, IF REQUIRED TO
DO SO PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS POLICY.

Terms in bold face type have special meaning. See the "Definitions" section of
this Policy.

 

In consideration of the payment of the Premium, and in reliance on all
statements made in the Inception Date Representations Letter and the Closing
Date Representations Letter, the Insurers and the Insured agree as follows:

SECTION I. INSURING CLAUSE

 

Subject to all of the terms, conditions and limitations of this Policy, the
Insurers will indemnify the Insured for, or pay on their behalf, in
proportion with their Quota Share Percentage, any Loss up to the Limit of
Liability that is covered under this Policy resulting from a Breach that the
Insured first discovers prior to the end of the Policy Term, provided that
the Breach is reported in writing to the Insurers pursuant to the terms of
Section IV(D) of this Policy.

 

SECTION II. DEFINITIONS

The following definitions shall have the meaning given below for all purposes
regarding this Policy:

The terms "Adjusted Purchase Price", "Affiliate", "Acquired Assets",
"Basket", "Cap", "Closing", "Closing Date", "Deductible", "Disclosure
Schedule", "Financial Information", "Fraud", "Seller" and "Seller Fundamental
Representations" have the meaning given to such terms in the Transaction
Agreement.

 

"Actual Knowledge" of a relevant person with respect to a particular fact,
event or condition, means that such person has an actual conscious knowledge
and awareness of such fact, event or condition and, with respect to a Breach,
that such person has an actual conscious awareness that such fact, event or
condition actually constitutes a Breach, and does not (1)
include constructive or implied knowledge or knowledge imputed from any other
person or entity including, without limitation, any outside advisors or agents
or (2) imply or require any duty or obligation of inquiry. The Insurers shall
bear the burden of proving that any such relevant person had Actual
Knowledge.

SECTION IV. GENERAL CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

 



   A. |

LIMIT OF LIABILITY AND RETENTION 

---|--- 
 



   (1) |

Subject to all of the terms, conditions and limitations of this Policy, the
Insurers shall indemnify the Insured for, or pay on its behalf, any Loss
which is in excess of the applicable Retention, up to the aggregate Limit of
Liability set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations. Loss otherwise covered
under this Policy shall, as appropriate, erode on a dollar for dollar basis
the Retention and/or be recoverable as Loss under this Policy regardless of
whether the Insureds have a right to claim against the Seller (or any other
person or entity) for such Loss pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. The
Insureds shall not be required to proceed against the Seller for recovery
under the Transaction Agreement with respect to any Loss, Breach or a Covered
Representation and Warranty prior to or as a condition to bringing a claim
under this Policy. 

---|--- 
 



   (2) |

The Limit of Liability shall be the maximum aggregate liability of the
Insurers under this Policy for all Loss resulting from all Breaches that the
Insured first discovers prior to the end of the Policy Term regardless of the
time of payment of such Loss by the Insurers. Covered Costs shall be part of
and not in addition to the Limit of Liability, and Covered Costs paid by the
Insurers shall reduce the Limit of Liability. 

---|--- 
 



   (3) |

The Insurers shall: 

---|--- 
 



     | (a) |

have no obligation to pay any Loss, nor shall the Insureds have any right to
have any Loss paid on their behalf by the Insurers, after exhaustion of the
Limit of Liability; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

only pay for any Loss when the applicable Retention has been fully exhausted
and then only to the extent that any covered Loss exceeds the applicable
Retention. 

---|---|--- 



   (4) |

The applicable Retention shall be eroded by any Loss otherwise covered under
this Policy but for the Retention (whether or not all or a portion of such
Loss is paid to any Insured by the Seller under the Transaction Agreement).
The Insurers and the Insured agree that it is the intent of the parties
hereto that claims for Loss (or any portion thereof) otherwise covered under
this Policy that exceed the Retention shall be subject to recovery under this
Policy (subject to the conditions, limitations and exclusions contained
herein) prior to and not conditioned upon seeking or obtaining recovery from
the Seller under the Transaction Agreement with respect to any Loss. 

---|--- 
 



   B. |

COVERED COSTS, SETTLEMENTS AND PAYMENT OF LOSS 

---|--- 
 



   (1) |

With respect to any Loss, the Insured shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue commercially reasonably available means of recovery of such
Loss as a result of a Breach; provided, that the Insurers shall not delay
payment of a covered Loss under this Policy while the Insured pursues such
recovery; provided, further, that the failure of any Insured to pursue such
rights shall only reduce the rights of the Insured to recover for a Loss under
this Policy to the extent of the Loss that would have been avoided by such
recovery; provided, further, that the Insured shall not be required to seek
recovery from the Seller for any Breach prior to or as a condition to bringing
a claim under this Policy. The Insurers, at their sole expense, shall have
the right, and shall be given the opportunity, to reasonably associate with
the Insured in any such pursuit. 

---|--- 
 



   (2) |

The Insurers, at their sole expense, shall also have the right, and shall be
given the opportunity, to reasonably associate with the Insured in the
investigation or prosecution of a Breach and in the negotiation of a
settlement of any such Breach. The Insured shall not consent to any
compromise, or settle any Breach for which the Insured is seeking 

---|--- 
 



(C) Ambridge Partners, LLC

POL07220 - January 2017

6 of 16

         |  coverage hereunder, without the Insurers prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided, however,_ that consent by the Insurers shall not be required if
the amount of any such compromise or settlement, including any related Covered
Costs, would not exceed (i) with respect to any Breach first discovered on or
prior to the Drop Down Date, 25% of the then-remaining amount of the
applicable Retention, and (ii) with respect to any Breach first discovered
after the Drop Down Date, 20% of the then-remaining amount of the
applicable Retention. The Insurers shall not be liable for any such
settlement or compromise for which consent of the Insurers is required and to
which the Insurers have reasonably not consented pursuant to this section.  
---|--- 



   (3) |

It is the duty of the Insured, and not the duty of the Insurers, to defend a
Third Party Claim; provided that the Insurers shall pay Covered Costs
incurred by the Insured in any such defense, if required to do so pursuant to
the terms and limitations set forth in this Policy. The Insurers shall have
the right, at their sole expense, and shall be given the opportunity, to
reasonably associate with the Insured in the investigation, defense, and
settlement, including but not limited to the negotiation of a settlement, of
any Third Party Claim for which the Insured seeks coverage in whole or in
part under this Policy. The Insured shall not incur Covered Costs, admit
liability, consent or stipulate to any judgment, or compromise or settle any
Third Party Claim for which it is seeking coverage under this Policy without
the Insurers prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Insurers shall not be liable for any
such settlement, compromise, Covered Costs, assumed obligation or admission to
which the Insurers have reasonably not consented; provided however, the
Insured may engage Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati as counsel to the Insured
for any Third Party Claim, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosatis prevailing
rates shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this Policy, without the
Insurers consent, and may incur Covered Costs which are otherwise covered
under this Policy in an amount not to exceed $50,000 per Third Party Claim,
without the Insurers consent but only to the extent such Covered Costs
are within the applicable Retention and do not exceed in the aggregate 50% of
the applicable Retention. 

---|--- 



   (4) |

The Insured agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Insurers with all information, assistance and co-operation that the Insurers
reasonably request with respect to any Breach or Third Party Claim and agrees
that it will not knowingly prejudice the Insurers position. The Insurers
shall cooperate in good faith with the Insured to preserve the privileged
status (and/or to preserve the protections of the work product doctrine) of
all information and documents disclosed to the Insurers in connection with
this Policy, any Breach or Third Party Claim, and the Insured and Insurers
agree that all such information and documents disclosed to the Insurers in
connection with this Policy, any Breach or Third Party Claim will be
disclosed pursuant to their common interest in defending against such a Breach
or Third Party Claim and with the express intention of preserving any
applicable privilege or immunity from discovery by others. With respect to
any other documents or information that are protected by the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, or other privileges, the Insurers shall
cooperate in good faith with the Insured to preserve the privileged status of
any such document or information. 

---|--- 



   (5) |

The Insured shall be required to verify based on the Actual Knowledge of the
Knowledgeable Parties and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Insurers
acting in good faith that the applicable Retention was validly and fully
eroded. 

---|--- 



    (6) |

If a Breach or Third Party Claim includes both covered and uncovered matters,
or if a Third Party Claim is made jointly against an Insured for whom
coverage is extended for such Third Party Claim and others for whom no
coverage is extended for such Third Party Claim, the Insured agrees that there
shall be a reasonable allocation between covered Loss and uncovered loss
based upon the relative legal and financial exposures and the relative
benefits obtained by the Insured and any uncovered third party with respect to
covered and uncovered matters. 

---|--- 
 



(C) Ambridge Partners, LLC

POL07220 - January 2017

       (7) |

Subject to the conditions set forth below, the Insurers shall advance insured
Covered Costs in excess of the applicable Retention before the final
disposition of a Third Party Claim against the Insured no later than thirty
(30) days after the receipt by the Insurers from the Insured of itemized
invoices for such Covered Costs. 

---|--- 



   (8) |

Payment of any covered Loss, except for Covered Costs paid pursuant to the
terms of Section IV(B)(7) of this Policy, hereunder shall be made to the
Insured, at the address set forth in Item 1 of the Declarations of this
Policy, as promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days
after the receipt by the Insurers of a sworn Proof of Loss from the Insured
completed with as full a description, after reasonable inquiry, as is
reasonably possible of the information reasonably required by this Policy
to establish a right to indemnification under this Policy in respect of a
Loss. Upon receipt of a Proof of Loss, the Insurers shall respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
after receipt of such Proof of Loss, by acknowledging or denying coverage for
the claimed Loss. If the Insurers are unable to determine a final coverage
position based on the information available, then the Insurers shall provide
an explanation to the Insured as to why they are unable to do so and request
such additional information as they may reasonably require from the Insured.
This provision shall not supplant any applicable law and regulations
concerning the submission of and Insurers response to a Proof of Loss. 

---|--- 



   C. |

MITIGATION, SUBROGATION AND REFUNDS 

---|--- 
 



   (1) |

The Insured shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss to
the extent required by the Transaction Agreement and/or applicable law and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with any reasonable and
specific request in writing by the Insurers to mitigate any actual or
potential Loss provided that the failure of the Insured to so mitigate or use
commercially reasonable efforts shall only reduce the rights of the Insured to
recover for a Loss under this Policy to the extent of the Loss that would
have been avoided by such mitigation and the burden of proving such amount
shall be on the Insurers; provided further, that the Insured shall not be
required or obligated to seek recovery or recourse under the Transaction
Agreement prior to or in connection with bringing a claim under this Policy. 

---|--- 



   (2) |

If the Insurers make any payment under this Policy, the Insurers shall be
subrogated, to the extent of that payment, to all the rights and remedies of
the Insured in respect of that payment and, subject to the remainder of this
Section IV.C(2), the Insurers shall be entitled, at their own expense, to sue
in the name of the Insured. In the course of pleading or filing any such
subrogation claim, the Insurers will use commercially reasonable efforts to do
so in a manner that does not include or require the identification of the
Insured in the caption of such pleading or filing. The Insured shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all reasonable actions requested in
writing by the Insurers to secure the rights and remedies of the Insurers in
subrogation. The Insurers shall not have any rights of subrogation against: 

---|--- 



     | (a) |

or otherwise paid Losses, and after such payment, a written statement or
other admission under oath or guilty plea or plea of no contest by the
Insured, a Knowledgeable Party or any direct or indirect equityholder, member,
officer, director or partner of the Insured (or the functional equivalent of
any such positions) or any of their respective Affiliates, or a finding of
fact, judgment or other ruling in any proceeding, establishes that the
Insured, a Knowledgeable Party or any direct or indirect equity holders,
member, officer, director or partner of the Insured (or the functional
equivalent of any such positions) or any of their respective Affiliates
committed a deliberately fraudulent or criminal act with respect to the
Transaction Agreement or a Covered Representation and Warranty and only to the

after such payment, a written statement or other admission under oath or
guilty plea or plea of no contest by the Seller or any direct or indirect
equityholder, member, officer, director or partner of the Seller (or the
functional equivalent of any such positions) or any of their respective

"Subrogation Threshold"); provided that after such Losses exceed the
Subrogation Threshold, the Insurers shall be permitted to subrogate against
such present or former customer, client or supplier, as applicable, without
the consent of the Named Insured, provided that the Insurers prior to
instituting a claim for subrogation against such present or former
customer, client or supplier gives the Named Insured prior written notice of
its intent to do so and, thereafter (upon request of the Named Insured),
provides reasonable updates with respect to the status of and circumstances of
such claim.

payment by the Insurers,

Offsetting Benefit, shall be net of Losses in excess of the Limit of
Liability) to the Insurers (but not in an amount greater than the amount paid
by the Insurers hereunder) within thirty (30) days of such determination or of
the Insureds receipt thereof, as applicable, in which case the Limit of
Liability shall be reinstated by the level of such amount paid over or
refunded; or

INFORMED PARTIES 

---|--- 
 

This Policy has been negotiated among, and agreed to by, informed and
knowledgeable parties, at arms-length and represented by legal counsel.
Neither the Insured nor the Insurers shall have the benefit of any presumption
or arbitrary interpretation of this Policy. Instead, this Policy shall be
construed in an evenhanded fashion as between the parties.



   F. |

CHOICE OF LAW 

---|--- 
 

The construction, interpretation and meaning of the terms, exclusions,
limitations and conditions of this Policy shall be determined in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, as applicable to insurance contracts
entered into in that State between citizens of that State, and in accordance
with the text as it appears in this Policy.

 



   G. |

ARBITRATION 

---|--- 
 

Any controversy or claim between the Insured and the Insurers arising out of
or relating to this Policy, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof,
shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a panel of three
arbitrators in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect. Each party shall
appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall select a
third independent and impartial arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place in
New York, New York, unless otherwise agreed.

 

The parties hereto agree that:



   (1) |

the speedy resolution of any disputes between them to be had as a consequence
of this arbitration clause is a mutual and material inducement to enter into
this Policy; 

---|--- 



   (2) |

the arbitrators in any award shall assess arbitration fees and expenses as set
forth below;  

---|--- 



   (3) |

awards pursuant to this clause are intended to be the exclusive dispute
resolution mechanism among the parties; and 

---|--- 



   (4) |

The party desiring arbitration of a dispute shall serve on the other party a
demand for arbitration, which demand shall include the name, address and
occupation of the arbitrator nominated by the demanding party. The other party
shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the demand, notify in
writing the demanding party of the name, address and 

---|--- 
 



(C) Ambridge Partners, LLC

POL07220 - January 2017

 

11 of 16

         |  occupation of the arbitrator nominated by it. The two
arbitrators so selected shall, within thirty (30) days of the appointment of
the second arbitrator, select an umpire. If the arbitrators are unable to
agree upon an umpire, the selection of an umpire shall be made by the AAA in
accordance with Rule R-13 of the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules and
Mediation Procedures. The parties shall present their respective cases to the
panel by written and oral evidence at a hearing to be held in New York City,
New York (or such other place as may be mutually agreed by the Insured and
Insurer) at such time as made be selected by the umpire. The decision of at
least two of the three panel members shall be binding and final and not
subject to appeal except that neither party waives its rights to seek vacature
of the award pursuant to any applicable state or federal statute. The fees
and expenses of the arbitration panel shall be allocated to the Insured and
the Insurers as determined by the arbitration panel based upon the relative
success (in terms of percentages) of each partys claims. For example, if the
final determination reflects a 60-40 compromise of the parties claims, the
arbitration panel would allocate expenses 40% to the party whose claims
determined to be 60% successful and 60% to the party whose claims were
determined to be 40% successful. The arbitration shall be administered by the
AAA and, except as provided otherwise herein, shall be conducted in accordance
with the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures. The
construction of this Policy shall be made in accordance with the general
principles of construction with respect to negotiated agreements. A judgment
may be entered on the award by any court of competent jurisdiction and the
parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court in
the county of New York, state of New York and irrevocably waive any challenge
to the jurisdiction or appropriateness of the venue of such a court including,
without limitation, any challenge based on convenience of the forum.

controlling entities to any sanction, prohibition, reporting obligation
or restriction under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic
sanctions, laws or regulations of the European Union, United Kingdom or United
States of America.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

 

NOTICE - OFFER OF TERRORISM COVERAGE

 

NOTICE - DISCLOSURE OF PREMIUM

THIS NOTICE DOES NOT FORM A PART OF YOUR POLICY, GRANT ANY COVERAGE OR CHANGE
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY COVERAGE UNDER THE POLICY

You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as
extended and reauthorized ("Act"), you have a right to purchase insurance
coverage of losses arising out of acts of terrorism, as defined in Section
102(1) of the Act, subject to all applicable policy provisions. The Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act established a federal program within the Department of the
Treasury, under which the federal government shares, with the insurance
industry, the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks.

This Notice is designed to alert you to coverage restrictions and to certain
terrorism provisions in the policy. If there is any conflict between this
Notice and the policy (including its endorsements), the provisions of the
policy (including its endorsements) apply.

CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF A CERTIFIED ACT OF TERRORISM

The Act applies when the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that an event
meets the definition of an act of terrorism. Originally the Act provides that
to be certified an act of terrorism must cause losses of at least five million
dollars and must have been committed by an individual or individuals acting on
behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest to coerce the government or
population of the United States. However, the 2007 re-authorization of the Act
no longer requires the act of terrorism to be committed by or on behalf of a
foreign interest and certified acts of terrorism now encompass, for example,
a terrorist act committed against the United States government by a United
States citizen when the act is determined by the federal government to be "a
certified act of terrorism".

In accordance with the Act, we are required to offer you coverage for losses
resulting from an act of terrorism that is certified under the federal
program. The policys other provisions, including nuclear, war or military
action exclusions, will still apply to such an act. The premium charge for
terrorism coverage for your policy is $0.

 

DISCLOSURE OF FEDERAL PARTICIPATION IN PAYMENT OF TERRORISM LOSSES

 

The United States Government, Department of the Treasury, will pay a share of
terrorism losses insured under the federal program. The federal share equals
85% of that portion of the amount of such insured losses that exceeds the
applicable insurer retention.

LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF TERRORISM LOSSES (applies to policies which cover
terrorism losses insured under the federal program, including those which only
cover fire losses)

If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under
the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31),
the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such
losses that exceeds $100 billion. 

Further, this coverage is subject to a limit on our liability, pursuant to the
federal law where, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts
certified under the Act exceed $100 billion in a Program Year (January 1
through December 31) and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, we
shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such
losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that
amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures
established by the Secretary of the Treasury.

 



    

All other terms and conditions of the Policy remain unchanged.

COVERAGE AND CAP ON LOSSES FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM

 

Wherever used in this endorsement: 1) "We" means the Insurers listed on the
policy declarations page; and 2) "Your" means the Named Insured listed on the
policy declarations page.

This endorsement modifies insurance provided under "your" policy.

 

In consideration of the premium charge of $0, it is agreed as follows:

 

This policy provides coverage for losses arising from "Certified Acts of
Terrorism" subject to all other terms and conditions of this policy.

 

If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the
federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a Program
Year (January 1 through December 31) and "we" have met our insurer deductible
under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, we shall not be liable for the payment
of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in
such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation
in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.

 

"Certified act of terrorism" means an act that is certified by the Secretary
of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney
General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism pursuant to the
federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The criteria contained in the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act for a "certified act of terrorism" include the following: 



   1. |

The act resulted in insured losses in excess of $5 million in the aggregate,
attributable to all types of insurance subject to the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act; and 

---|--- 



   2. |

The act is a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property
or infrastructure and is committed by an individual or individuals as part of
an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to
influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by
coercion.
