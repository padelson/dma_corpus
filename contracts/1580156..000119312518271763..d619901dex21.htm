connection with such third party claim equals or exceeds <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of (A)&nbsp;the amount of Damages sought in such third party claim or (B)&nbsp;if such third party claim is unliquidated, the reasonably likely
amount of such Damages and (ii)&nbsp;such third party claim does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (other than incidental claims for equitable relief);<U> provided that</U>, the
Indemnified Party can assume the defense of any third party claim (the defense of which was previously assumed by the Indemnifying Party) in the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to reasonably defend the claim, action or proceeding. If the

participate therein at its own expense (including by retaining separate counsel to monitor and consult with respect to, and participate in but not direct, such defense); provided that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and
the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered &#147;Damages&#148; for purposes of this Agreement; further provided, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense (the &#147;<U>Controlling Party</U>&#148;) shall keep the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-Controlling</FONT> Party advised of the status of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and shall reasonably cooperate with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-Controlling</FONT> Party in all matters relating to such defense (including by reasonably considering recommendations made by
the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-Controlling</FONT> Party with respect thereto). The Controlling Party shall not agree to any settlement or compromise of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the <FONT

proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the Controlling Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to agree to any
settlement or compromise without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such settlement or compromise includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto and does not impose any affirmative obligation or
obligation (whether monetary or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-monetary),</FONT> or any contingent liability or obligation, on the Indemnified Party. </P>

Agreement are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and without those rights, Seller would not have entered into the Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the remedies available to Seller under
Section&nbsp;9.14 of the Purchase Agreement and this letter shall be in addition to any other remedy to which Seller is entitled, and the election to pursue any injunction or specific performance under Section&nbsp;9.14 of the Purchase Agreement

month during which such Service is provided. If Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs costs or expenses on behalf of Buyer as well as other businesses operated by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the provision of any Services that
<U>Schedule A</U> hereto provides will be billed to Buyer on a pass-through basis, Seller will allocate any such costs or expenses on a pro rata basis based on Buyer&#146;s proportional share of its use of such Services, as determined in good faith
by Seller. Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, keep and maintain such books and records as may be reasonably necessary to make such allocations. Seller shall make copies of such books and records available to Buyer for

separately stated on the applicable Invoice and shall be the responsibility of Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to any taxes, duties, excises, tariffs, fees, assessments or levies based (in whole or in part)
on net income or profits. </P>

DEFINITION OF A CERTIFIED ACT OF TERRORISM </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Act applies when the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that an event meets the definition of an act of
terrorism. Originally the Act provides that to be certified an act of terrorism must cause losses of at least five million dollars and must have been committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign
interest to coerce the government or population of the United States. However, the 2007 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-authorization</FONT> of the Act no longer requires the act of terrorism to be committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest
and certified acts of terrorism now encompass, for example, a terrorist act committed against the United States government by a United States citizen when the act is determined by the federal government to be &#147;a certified act of
terrorism&#148;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the Act, we are required to offer you coverage for losses resulting from an act of terrorism that is certified under
the federal program. The policy&#146;s other provisions, including nuclear, war or military action exclusions, will still apply to such an act. The premium charge for terrorism coverage for your policy is $0. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DISCLOSURE OF FEDERAL PARTICIPATION IN PAYMENT OF TERRORISM LOSSES </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United States Government, Department of the Treasury, will pay a share of terrorism losses insured under the federal program. The federal share equals 85%
of that portion of the amount of such insured losses that exceeds the applicable insurer retention. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF TERRORISM LOSSES (applies to
policies which cover terrorism losses insured under the federal program, including those which only cover fire losses) </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If aggregate insured losses
attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed $100&nbsp;billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31), the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100&nbsp;billion.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, this coverage is subject to a limit on our liability, pursuant to the federal law where, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist
acts certified under the Act exceed $100&nbsp;billion in a Program Year (January 1 through December 31) and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that
exceeds $100&nbsp;billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury. </P>
