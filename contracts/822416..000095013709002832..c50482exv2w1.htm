any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d) and

value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes

the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)&nbsp;such fractional share interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder, and
rounding such fractional share interest to four decimal places) would otherwise be entitled by (B)
the per share value calculated as the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Parent
Common Stock for the five most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the
last full trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge that
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not
represent separately bargained-for consideration. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the aggregate amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall reasonably promptly thereafter deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent
and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders without interest, subject to
and in accordance with the terms of Section&nbsp;2.2.

date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio,
the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

Trust Company, N.A. or such other exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the

to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, the Restricted Shares and Restricted
Stock Units, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Sections&nbsp;2.1(a) and 5.6(a)(ii) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if
uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued). Following the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay
any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(c). All certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock (including the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d)) are hereinafter referred to as the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedures</U>. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
and in any event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1, (i)&nbsp;a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and
title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to the Exchange Agent and which
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be
made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued), cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d) and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(c). Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares
surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1 (which shall
be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment by cash
or check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof
that the surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result
of such registration in the name of a
person other than the registered holder of such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section&nbsp;2.2(b), each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section
2.1(d) or Section&nbsp;2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
amount payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d) or Section&nbsp;2.2(c). If any certificate representing any
Share(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form
representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or

within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent&#146;s management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to

the effectiveness of Parent&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rule&nbsp;13a-15

is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
