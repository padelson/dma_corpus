Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the NRS.

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(b) and 2.1(d), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.25 per share, of the Company (together with the preferred share purchase rights granted pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement (the " _Company Rights_ ")) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 0.975 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), including the preferred share purchase rights granted pursuant to the Parent Rights Agreement (the " _Parent Rights_ "), of Parent (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All references in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to include the associated Parent Rights unless the context requires otherwise. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any other Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the 

    ##### 

  

    

holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder, and rounding such fractional share interest to four decimal places) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share value calculated as the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the last full trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the aggregate amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall reasonably promptly thereafter deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders without interest, subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or such other exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the Merger 

    ##### 

  

    

Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, the Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Sections 2.1(a) and 5.6(a)(ii) (or appropriate alternative arrangements
shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will
be issued). Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock (including the amount of any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d)) are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment by cash or check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c). If any certificate representing any Share(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or 

    ##### 

  

    

destroyed certificate representing any Share(s) to provide a customary
affidavit and to deliver a bond in a reasonable amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
certificate representing such Share(s). 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(d), until in either case, such Share has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Following surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. The Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock Units, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c), subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any certificate representing any Share shall not 

    ##### 

  

    

have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common
Stock or any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder of
such certificate representing any Share would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares of Parent Common
Stock, dividends or other distributions in respect of such certificate
representing any Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 Section 5.6 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. 

   

 (i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be converted into a vested option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions (except as provided in this Section 5.6(a)(i)) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The per-share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Parent Stock Options will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which the Company Stock Options were exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting per-share exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. Solely with respect to a Company Stock Option granted with an exercise price of less than $40.00 per share of Company Common Stock (which shall have been converted into a Parent Stock Option pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.6(a)(i)), the terms of such Parent Stock Option (as so converted) shall provide that if the employment of the applicable option holder is terminated under circumstances that would entitle such option holder to severance benefits under a severance plan, program or agreement in which such option holder participates (or to which such option holder is a party) as of immediately following the Effective Time (a " _Severance Event_ ") during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof, such Parent Stock Option shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (1) the later of (x) the third anniversary of the date of such termination of employment and (y) the date on which the Company Stock Option (which shall have been converted into a Parent Stock Option pursuant to the terms hereof) would cease to be exercisable in accordance with its terms and (2) the expiration of the scheduled term of the Company Stock Option (which shall have been converted into a Parent Stock Option pursuant to the terms hereof). No later than the Effective Time, the Company shall pass such resolutions as are necessary to approve the terms of this Section 5.6(a)(i). 

  

 (ii) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") and each restricted or deferred stock unit based on shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, vest and be converted, on the same terms and conditions (except as provided in this Section 5.6(a)(ii)) as were applicable under such Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time, into a number of shares of Parent Common Stock or units with respect to Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such grant of Restricted Shares or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, and (B) the Exchange Ratio. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of performance units with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Performance Units_ ") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, vest and be converted, into the right to receive, immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Unit, assuming the achievement of all performance goals applicable to such Company Performance Unit at target levels and (ii) the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Amended and Restated Centex Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan) of Company Common Stock on the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (iv) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding Company Stock Option and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.6(a)). 

  

 (v) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Parent Stock Options resulting from the conversion of Company Stock Options assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.6(a). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock Options resulting from the conversion of Company Stock Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Stock Options remain outstanding. 

  

 (b) _Employee Matters_. 

    

 (i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2009, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former Company Employee, other than such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, compensation and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time (except that the Companys Salary Continuation Plan shall be disregarded for purposes of this sentence). Thereafter, it is the intention of Parent that over the long term Company Employees and similarly situated employees of Parent, taking into account the job responsibilities, scope of duties, performance and geographic location of such employees, will be treated alike in terms of compensation and benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period beginning on January 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, any change made in the salary or annual incentive bonus of any Company Employee, other than any such employee covered by collective 

   ##### 

  

    

bargaining agreements, shall not affect such Company Employee in a manner
which is disproportionate, taking into account the market pay, job
responsibilities, scope of duties, performance and geographic location of
such employees, to any change in the salary or annual incentive bonus of any
similarly situated employee of Parent. From and after December 31, 2009,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and
former Company Employee, other than such employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements, pension and welfare benefits including
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and vision benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the pension and welfare benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent. 

   

 (ii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, accrual of benefits and level of benefits) under the "employee benefit plans" (as such term is defined in section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and programs of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited for his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan or program in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits and,  _provided_ , _further_ , that Company Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time shall not be included for purposes of determining whether a Company Employee satisfies the requirements of the "Seventy Year Rule" (within the meaning of Parents equity incentive plans and option award agreements thereunder), unless the Company Employee terminates employment after December 31, 2011. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Stock Plans and the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2010, Parent shall provide (A) severance benefits on an individual-by-individual basis that are no less favorable to the applicable Company Employee than the severance benefits provided to such Company Employee under the Companys severance plans, programs and agreements as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the Companys Salary Continuation Plan shall be disregarded for purposes of this Section 5.6(b)(iv)(A)) and (B) paid time-off benefits on an individual-by-individual basis that are no less favorable to the applicable Company Employee than the paid time-off programs provided to such Company Employee under the Companys paid time-off programs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may establish a short-term incentive compensation program (the " _New Bonus Plan_ ") for the Companys fiscal year which commenced April 1, 2009 and may establish with respect to each individual who participates in a short-term incentive plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (a " _Bonus Plan Participant_ ") short-term incentive compensation target payout levels (i.e., target, maximum, threshold), provided that the target payout level with respect to each such Bonus Plan Participant shall be no greater than 100% of such Bonus Plan Participants target payout opportunity under the short-term incentive compensation program in which such Bonus Plan Participant participated during the Companys fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (or in the case of a newly-hired or promoted employee, the opportunity provided to similarly situated Company Employees) (the " _Full Bonus_ "); _provided_ that, if the Effective Time occurs, (A) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Bonus Plan Participant employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on December 31, 2009, as soon as practicable following such date, but in no event later than March 15, 2010, an amount equal to the product of (1) the applicable Bonus Plan Participants target bonus under the New Bonus Plan and (2) 75% (the " _Unprorated Bonus_ ") and (B) Parent shall pay to each Bonus Plan Participant who experiences a Severance Event prior to December 31, 2009, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 30 days, following the applicable Severance Event, an amount equal to the product of (1) the Unprorated Bonus and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days between (and including) April 1, 2009 and the applicable Severance Event and the denominator of which is 275. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each of the five Bonus Plan Participants identified in Section 5.6(b)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, any payment made pursuant to the New Bonus Plan to such a Bonus Plan Participant shall be made at the Effective Time in an amount equal to such Bonus Plan Participants Full Bonus and shall (in the event of a termination prior to March 31, 2010 of such Bonus Plan Participants employment entitling such Bonus Plan Participant to severance under the Companys Plan Regarding Severance After a Change in Control (the " _Change in Control Plan_ ")) reduce the payment to such Bonus Plan Participant under the Change in Control Plan in accordance with the terms of such plan as of the date hereof. For the 

   ##### 

  

    

avoidance of doubt, the amount of any severance pay payable to a Bonus Plan
Participant identified in Section 5.6(b)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule under the Change in Control Plan shall be reduced in such
circumstances pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control Plan by
an amount equal to the product of (A) the Full Bonus paid to such Bonus Plan
Participant and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of
days between the date on which the applicable Severance Event occurs and
March 31, 2010 and the denominator of which equals 365. The New Bonus Plan
shall be the sole short-term incentive compensation plan in effect for the
Companys fiscal year which commenced April 1, 2009 (other than any commission
or similar sales incentive plans or the retention program established in
accordance with this Agreement). The Company shall take, or cause to be
taken, any and all actions, including, but not limited to, (x) amending the
terms of any short-term incentive compensation, severance or other plans,
programs or agreements in which any Bonus Plan Participant participates (or
to which any Bonus Plan Participant is a party) and (y) obtaining any
consents from any Bonus Plan Participants, in each case as are necessary, to
ensure that, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the terms
of any such plans, programs or agreements in which any Bonus Plan Participant
participates (or to which any Bonus Plan Participant is a party) comply with,
and are not otherwise inconsistent with, the terms of the New Bonus Plan as
set forth in this Section 5.6(b)(v). Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided to, each Company Employee a bonus opportunity for calendar year 2010
consistent with the principles articulated in Section 5.6(b)(i). 

   

 (vi) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may establish a long-term incentive compensation program (the " _New LTIP_ ") for the Companys fiscal year which commenced April 1, 2009 and may grant each individual who participates in a long-term incentive plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (an " _LTIP Participant_ ") a long-term incentive award under an equity incentive plan of the Company which shall consist of a number of Restricted Shares having a fair market value on the date of grant (the " _Grant Date_ ") no greater than 100% of the total value on the date of grant of the aggregate long term incentive awards granted to such LTIP Participant with respect to the Companys fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (or in the case of a newly-hired or promoted employee, the awards granted to similarly situated Company Employees). Each award granted under the New LTIP shall provide that no Restricted Shares subject to the award shall vest immediately upon the Effective Time and such Restricted Shares shall vest (1) on March 31, 2010, with respect to 1/3 of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date, (2) on March 31, 2011, with respect to an additional 1/3 of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date and (3) on March 31, 2012, with respect to the remaining 1/3 of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date. Each award granted under the New LTIP also shall provide that (A) at the Effective Time, 25% of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date shall be forfeited by the LTIP Participant to the Company, (B) after the Effective Time, notwithstanding the vesting schedule in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Restricted Shares shall vest (x) on March 31, 2010, with respect to 25% of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date, (y) on March 31, 2011, with respect to an additional 25% of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date and (z) on March 31, 2012, with respect to the 

   ##### 

  

    

remaining 25% of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on
the Grant Date and (C) if, after the Effective Time, an LTIP Participant
experiences a Severance Event (x) prior to the first anniversary of the Grant
Date, the award shall immediately vest with respect to 25% of the number of
Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date, (y) after the first
anniversary of the Grant Date, but prior to the second anniversary of the
Grant Date, the award shall immediately vest with respect to an additional
25% of the number of Restricted Shares subject to the award on the Grant Date
and (z) after the second anniversary of the Grant Date, but prior to the
third anniversary of the Grant Date, the award shall immediately vest in
full. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.6(b)(i), Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided to, each Company Employee long term
incentive awards for calendar year 2010 no less favorable than the long-term
incentive awards provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, taking
into account the job responsibilities, scope of duties, performance and
geographic location of the employees.

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law), including with respect to the matters set forth in Section 5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or agreement. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent required, promptly, but in no event later than fifteen days after the date hereof, make their respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, 

    #####

further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or
competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any
other Governmental Entity may assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
parties shall take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date),
including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parents
or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or its
affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing,  _provided_ that any such agreement or
action by the Company shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not
be obligated to take any action, propose or make any divestiture or other
undertaking, or propose or enter into a consent decree, in each case that
would have either a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions
of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company or

third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
The Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate
in any meeting or discussion (other than relating to the scheduling of any
meetings or of any discussions), either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate. The Company and Parent shall furnish the other with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any Governmental Entity. Either Parent or
the Company may designate any competitively sensitive information provided to
the other under this Agreement as "outside counsel only". Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside legal
counsel of the other and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of their client unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the disclosing party or its legal
counsel. 

   

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.7, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any 

    ##### 

  

    

proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or
7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with

 Section 5.8 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, shall grant such approvals and take such actions, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company Change of Recommendation, Parent Change of Recommendation or any action taken by the Company or the Company Board pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.4, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public announcement primarily relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public announcement as may be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, shall use reasonable efforts not to issue any such press release or make any such public announcement without consulting the other parties. Parent and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable joint press release announcing this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party shall survive the Merger and shall 

    ##### 

  

    

continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years from the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect
the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of
the Companys and any Company Subsidiarys articles of incorporation and by-
laws or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification
or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving Corporations articles
of incorporation and by-laws set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally
liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with
their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.10
without limit as to time. 

   

 (b) At and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. 

   

 (c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect (i) the coverage provided by the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time or (ii) a "tail" policy (which the Company may purchase at its option prior to the Effective Time, and, in such case, Parent shall cause such policy to be in full force and effect, and shall cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation) under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy that covers those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the 

     ##### 

  

    

date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time, is from a carrier with comparable credit ratings to Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy carrier and contains terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than those of the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Effective Time, Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall

 (a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; 

   

 (b) by either the Company or Parent if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before November 7, 2009 (the " _End Date_ "), _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to a party that fails to perform or comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 (c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, judgment, decree or ruling permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such order, judgment, decree or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable, _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove or prevent entry of such order, judgment, decree or ruling; 

   

 (d) by either the Company or Parent if the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company Stockholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Company of this Agreement;

Fee (other than, in the case of the Company, the obligation to pay the

in such Section shall apply). 

   

 (i) In the event that either party shall fail to pay when due any Termination Fee required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section 7.2, such Termination Fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Termination Fee became past due, at a rate equal to the sum of (x) the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_  plus (y) 5%, calculated on a daily basis until the date of actual payment. In addition, if either party shall fail to pay such Termination Fee when due, such owing party shall also pay to the owed party all of the owed partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), as applicable, in connection with efforts to collect such amounts.

 Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

   

 Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto), the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is not intended to grant standing to any person other than the parties except, following the Effective Time, for the provisions of Sections 2.1, 5.6(a) and 5.10. 

   

 Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. 

   

 Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.
