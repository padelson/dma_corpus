ARTICLE I

 



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Company. Company shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.



1.2 _Closing_. The Closing shall take place as soon as practicable, and in any
event not later than two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver
of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof or at such other
time as the parties hereto may agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall
take place at the offices of Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady Falk and Rabkin, A
Professional Corporation, 3 Embarcadero Center, 7th Floor, San Francisco,
California 94111, or at such other location as the parties hereto may agree in
writing.



1.3 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Company shall prepare,
and on the Closing Date the parties shall file, a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law. The Merger shall
become effective at the Effective Time as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware on the Closing Date (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"Effective Time").



 

1 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and Officers_. Unless
otherwise determined by Merger Sub before the Effective Time, at
the Effective Time:



(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) The By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 



(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as Merger Sub
may otherwise notify Company in writing prior to the Effective Time, the
officers of Company immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation.



1.6  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or
the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of stock of the
constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:



(a) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Company
Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") that is owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or held in
the treasury of Company (collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash,
Company Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion or Retention of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares and subject to Section 1.8
with respect to Restricted Stock and Escrowed Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount equal to $18.50 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Company Common Stock following the Merger in the manner set forth in Section
1.7. All shares of Company Common Stock converted into Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 1.6(c) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive with respect to
each underlying share of Company Common Stock the Merger Consideration. If,
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, then
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.



(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall have those rights,
but only those rights, of holders who perfect their appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the Delaware Law. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demand, purported demand, objection, notice, petition, or other
communication received from stockholders or provided to stockholders by
Company with respect to any Dissenting Shares or shares claimed to be
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations  



 

2  and proceedings with respect to such shares. Payment of any amount payable
to the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be the obligation of Company.
However, Company agrees that, without the prior written consent of Parent, it
shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any demand or purported demand respecting such shares.



1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article Article I, an amount of
cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the total number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such product, the "Aggregate
Merger Consideration," and such aggregate cash being deposited, the "Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the
Surviving Corporation, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any
and all interest earned on the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates, or an electronic book entry position in lieu of a
physical certificate or certificates, that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate")
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Exchange Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions
of this Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of Company, payment may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 1.7. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged For Cash_.
The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this Article I shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for cash
theretofore represented by such Certificates.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any
holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment
of the Merger Consideration.



 

3 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
Company or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration to all of
the holders of Company Common Stock as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



1.8 _Equity Incentive Plans and Related Matters_.



(a) _Company Options_.



(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding with
an exercise price less than the Merger Consideration (an "In-the-Money
Option") shall be assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such In-the-Money Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock, with such amount rounded down to the nearest whole cent
(the "Option Consideration").



(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then
outstanding with an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration (an
"Underwater Option") shall become fully vested and exercisable. At the
Effective Time, each Underwater Option shall terminate.



(iii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to: (x) pay to holders of In-
the-Money Options that immediately prior to the Effective Time were vested,
the Option Consideration less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment related to such vested In-the-Money Options promptly
after the Effective Time and (y) pay to holders of In-the-Money Options that
immediately prior to the Effective Time were unvested, the Option
Consideration less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment over time and without interest in accordance with the vesting
schedule set forth in the agreement evidencing such In-the-Money Options.



 

4 (iv) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.8(a), each In-the-
Money Option so assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions set forth in the agreement evidencing such
option and the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to vesting, except that
each In-the-Money Option shall be converted into the right to receive the
Option Consideration as described in this Section 1.8(a), and except that
payment of the Option Consideration shall be made promptly after the
Effective Time or promptly after the applicable vesting dates, as described in
this Section 1.8(a), and not upon exercise of the assumed In-the-Money Options
by the holder.



(v) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company
Option describing the treatment of the Company Option in accordance with this
Section 1.8(a).



(b) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, the unvested shares of
Restricted Stock that are then outstanding shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration; provided, however, that the Merger Consideration issuable in
exchange therefor shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan or other agreements by which
such shares of Restricted Stock were issued or are otherwise subject,
including the vesting schedule. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to,
pay to holders of Restricted Stock the Merger Consideration less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment over time and
without interest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the
agreement by which such shares of Restricted Stock were issued or are
otherwise subject. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of
Restricted Stock describing the treatment of the Restricted Stock in
accordance with this Section 1.8(b).



(c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors shall terminate Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan and return
all cash accumulated in each participants account to such participants.



(d) _Escrowed Shares_. At the Effective Time, the Escrowed Shares that are
then outstanding shall be converted into the Merger Consideration; provided
that for the avoidance of doubt, such conversion and the consummation of the
Merger shall not affect in any manner the Escrow Agreement or the rights and
obligations of the parties thereto under the Escrow Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of the holders of the
Escrowed Shares to obtain the Merger Consideration for their Escrowed Shares
pursuant to Section 1.7 or otherwise shall be subject to the rights of the
Company against the Escrowed Shares under the Escrow Agreement (and the
Companys right to the Merger Consideration into which the Escrowed Shares
have been converted).

 



(e) _Other Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Companys Board of
Directors shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary
to effectuate this Section 1.8. At the Effective Time, the Company agrees to
effect the termination of the Companys Equity Incentive Plans.



1.9 _Taking of Necessary or Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cause their respective officers to take all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

action is required to discharge Companys Board of Directors fiduciary
duties  



 

22  to Companys stockholders under Delaware Law, (C) at least three (3)
Business Days shall have passed following Parents receipt of written
notice from Company advising Parent that Companys Board of Directors has
received such a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and Parent does not

faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, is as favorable (taking into account the Termination Fee) to
Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal and (D) concurrently with
taking such action Company shall both terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) and pay any applicable fee required by Section 8.3.

Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (a

(b) If requested by Parent, Company shall, immediately prior to the Closing,
terminate any one or more of the Company Employee Benefit Plans. In the event
Parent requests that any of the Company Employee  



 

25  Benefit Plans be terminated, Company shall adopt resolutions and shall take
all other actions necessary to effect the termination of any such plans, to
be effective no later than the Closing Date, and shall provide to Parent
executed resolutions by the board of directors of Company authorizing the
termination of any such plans.



(c) With respect to employee benefit plans, if any, of Parent or its
subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate

the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to undertake commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) with respect to each Parent Plan that is a medical
or health plan, (x) waive any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under
such Parent Plan that would result in a lack of coverage for any condition for
which the applicable Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage
under the corresponding Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee was an active participant immediately prior to his or her
transfer to the Parent Plan; (y) waive any waiting period under such Parent
Plan, to the extent that such period exceeds the corresponding waiting period
under the corresponding Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee was an active participant immediately prior to his or her
transfer to the Parent Plan (after taking into account the service credit
provided for herein for purposes of satisfying such waiting period); and (z)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee prior to his or her transfer to
the Parent Plan (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous
Company Employee Benefit Plans prior to such transfer) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan
for the plan year that includes such transfer; and (ii) recognize service of
the Continuing Employees with the Acquired Companies (or their respective
predecessors) for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit,
and, solely with respect to vacation and severance benefits, benefit accrual
in any Parent Plan in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was
recognized for that purpose under the analogous Company Employee Benefit
Plans prior to such transfer; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits.

other party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to (i)
delist the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq National Market and (ii) to
terminate the registration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act;
provided that such delisting or termination shall not be effective until
after the Effective Time.

other parties of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be
instituted or threatened against a party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto shall promptly notify the others of any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation that may be threatened or asserted in
writing, brought or commenced against Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, that would have been listed in
