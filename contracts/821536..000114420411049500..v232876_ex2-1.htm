2.5 Cure Costs; Disclosure Schedule Updates.

  

  

(a) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay, or fund the reimbursement of
Sellers for the payment of, all Cure Costs in the amounts set forth on
Schedule 1.1(p). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Purchaser may revise any Schedule setting forth the Assigned Contracts (or
any category thereof), the Purchased Assets or the Excluded Assets to (i)
include in or exclude from the definition of Purchased Assets (pursuant to the
applicable Schedule) and to include in the definition of Excluded Assets, any
asset of Sellers, including, without limitation, any Contract of Sellers or
other asset, not previously included in the Purchased Assets, at any time on
or prior to the tenth (10th) day prior to the Sale Hearing, and require
Sellers to give notice to the parties to any such Contract and (ii) exclude
from the definition of Purchased Assets (pursuant to the applicable Schedule)
and to include in the definition of Excluded Assets, any Purchased Asset,
including, without limitation, any Assigned Contract or other asset of Sellers
previously included in the Purchased Assets, at any time on or prior to the
ten (10) days prior to the Sale Hearing; provided that no such change of the
Schedules, the definition of the Purchased Assets or the definition of the
Excluded Assets shall reduce the amount of the Purchase Price and provided
further that no item in "Excluded Assets" shall be included in the "Purchased
Assets." If any Contract is added to the Purchased Assets as permitted by this
Section 2.5, Sellers shall promptly take such steps as are reasonably
necessary, including, if applicable, payment or adequate assurance of payment
of all Cure Costs (which shall be funded by the Purchaser in cash at Closing)
and prompt delivery of notice to the non-debtor counterparty, to cause such
Contracts to be assumed by Sellers, and assigned to the Purchaser, on the
Closing Date. If any Contract or other asset is excluded from the Purchased
Assets as permitted by this Section 2.5, Seller shall promptly take such steps
as are required to cause such Contract to be treated as an Excluded Asset
under the Sale Order and this Agreement. Without limiting any of the
Purchaser's rights pursuant to this Section 2.5, in the event that the Sale
Order does not approve the assignment or transfer of one or more of the
Assigned Contracts to the Purchaser as Purchased Assets, the Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion and at any time prior to the Closing Date, exclude any or
all of the Assigned Contracts from the Purchased Assets, but may not otherwise
terminate its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event any party to a Contract timely objects to the calculation of
the Cure Costs for such Contract designated by Sellers and alleges that the
Cure Cost for such Contract exceeds the amount calculated by Sellers for such
Contract (the amount of such excess Cure Cost for the Contract in question,
the "Excess Cure Amount"), then, (i) Sellers shall provide written notice to
Purchaser of such Cure Cost objection and the amount of such Excess Cure
Amount for each of the proposed Assumed Contracts, and (ii) Purchaser shall,
within three (3) business days after receipt of such notice from Sellers
either (a) notify Sellers that Purchaser elects not to assume such Contract if
the Excess Cure Amount is in excess of ten percent of the Cure Cost for such
Contract and (b) take no action with respect to such notice, in which case,
such Contract shall continue to be assumed by Purchaser at the Closing. At the
Closing, Sellers shall retain the aggregate Excess Cure Amounts for all
Assumed Contracts in escrow and shall use commercial reasonable efforts to
resolve such discrepancy with such Contract parties after the Closing. In the
event any such discrepancies are resolved by Sellers, then, Sellers shall
refund such Excess Cure Amounts to Purchaser less any out of pocket expenses
incurred by Sellers to resolve such matter(s). In the event Sellers do not
resolve such discrepancy with such Contract party in question, then, Sellers
shall deliver such Excess Cure Amount to the Contract parties in question.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 19 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.6 Transition Services Agreement. At the Closing, if requested by the
Purchaser, Sellers and the Purchaser shall execute and deliver the Transition
Services Agreement. In the event Sellers and Purchaser fail to execute and
deliver the Transition Services Agreement for any reason or for no reason,
such failure to execute and deliver such Transition Services Agreement shall
not constitute a condition to the obligation of Sellers and Purchaser to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event no Transition
Services Agreement is executed, then, Section 9.3 of this Agreement shall
apply with respect to the matters which were to be addressed in such
Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

2.7 Further Conveyances and Assumptions. From time to time following the
Closing, Sellers and the Purchaser shall, and Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquaintances and
such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
necessary or appropriate to assign and convey fully to the Purchaser and its
respective successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights, titles,
interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to
the Purchaser under this Agreement and Sellers' Documents and to ensure the
assumption of the Liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by the
Purchaser under this Agreement and Sellers' Documents, and to otherwise make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

  

2.8 "As Is" Transaction. PURCHASER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT
AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ARTICLE V OF THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS MAKE
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT
TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE PURCHASED ASSETS. WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING
THE FOREGOING, SELLERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AS TO ANY PORTION OF THE
PURCHASED ASSETS. PURCHASER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PURCHASER HAS CONDUCTED
AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE
PURCHASED ASSETS AND ALL SUCH OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OR AFFECTING THE
PURCHASED ASSETS AS PURCHASER DEEMED NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE AND THAT IN
PROCEEDING WITH ITS ACQUISITION OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR ANY
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V HEREOF,
PURCHASER IS DOING SO BASED SOLELY UPON SUCH INDEPENDENT INSPECTIONS AND
INVESTIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, PURCHASER WILL ACCEPT THE PROPERTY AT THE CLOSING
"AS IS," "WHERE IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
(EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) AND WITHOUT RECOURSE.

2.9 Mutual General Release Regarding Auxiliary Health. In order to induce
Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement, effective on the Closing
under this Agreement: (A) HUSA hereby irrevocably and forever releases
Auxiliary Health from any and all loans, claims and other Indebtedness payable
to HUSA or any of its affiliates by Auxiliary Health, including, without
limitation, any loans owing by Auxiliary Health to HUSA or any of its
affiliates, if any and (B) Auxiliary Health hereby irrevocably and forever
releases HUSA from any and all loans, claims and other Indebtedness payable
from HUSA or any of its affiliates to Auxiliary Health, including, without
limitation, any loans owing by HUSA or any affiliates to Auxiliary Health or
any of its affiliates, if any. Purchaser shall be an express third party
beneficiary of this Section 2.9. If requested by Purchaser, Sellers shall
execute and deliver a separate mutual release agreement at the Closing to
Purchaser confirming the mutual release set forth in this Section 2.9.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

CONSIDERATION AND DEPOSIT

  

  

3.1 Consideration.

  

  

(a) The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the "Purchase Price") 1 shall
be the sum of the following:

  

  

(i) the amount of the Deposit; plus

  

  

(ii) the "all cash" sum in the amount of Fifty Two Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty Four and NO/100 Dollars ($52,759,934.00) and
an amount sufficient to satisfy the outstanding obligations under the DIP Loan
(in an amount not to exceed $10,000,000) (such amount, the "Cash Balance");
plus

  

  

(iii) the elimination of a rejection damages claim under the Siemens Supply
Agreement; plus

     

 

  

    

1

  |  

HUSA, Parent and the Purchaser have agreed that solely for purposes of the
comparison of bids from the Purchaser and William Demant Holdings A/S
("Demant") during the Auction, the offer by the Purchaser would reflect an
amount equal to $20 million corresponding to the value, agreed to for such
purposes, of eliminating the possibility of a rejection damages claim
regarding Parent's Supply Agreement as long as the Purchaser was the
Prevailing Bidder. HUSA, Parent and the Purchaser agreed to use this number
solely for purposes of (i) qualifying the Purchaser's Bid pursuant to the
Bidding Procedures Order, (ii) comparing the Purchaser\'s Bids with Bids by
Demant, (iii) designating the value to assign such Bid for purposes of the
Auction and Sale Hearing in the event that the Purchaser was the Prevailing
Bidder, and (iv) resolving Parent's Objection to the Sale (as to HUSA's
determination of highest and best bid) [D.E. 326]. However, HUSA, Parent and
the Purchaser did not agree to use this value for any other purposes and HUSA
(in consultation with the Committees), the Purchaser and Demant stipulated to
the $20 million valuation for the purposes set forth above and agreed that the
Purchaser retained the right to assert a rejection damages claim in excess of
$20 million, and that HUSA and the Committees retained the right to object to
the assertion of any rejection damages, in the event that the Purchaser was
not the Prevailing Bidder or the Court determined not to approve the Sale to
the Purchaser. All other rights, claims, defenses and setoffs between the
parties hereto are otherwise expressly preserved, including without
limitation, the right of Parent to assert a rejection damage claim in excess
of the amount set forth above and HUSA's and the Committees' rights to object
to the allowance and amount of any rejection claim asserted by Parent now or
in the future should Purchaser not be the Prevailing Bidder (as such term is
defined in the Bidding Procedures Order) or the Bankruptcy Court determines
not to approve the Sale. Because this amount, as agreed to for the stated
purposes, relates to the so stipulated value of such rejection damages in the
event that the Purchaser was not the Prevailing Bidder, it is not necessarily
included in the Purchase Price for purposes of the allocation provided for in
Section 11.1(b).

(i) Subject to Section 2.5, the Purchaser and/or Parent shall pay directly to
the obligees identified on Schedule 1.1(p) the Cure Costs;

  

  

(ii) The Purchaser and/or Parent shall pay directly to the appropriate
Governmental Body the Transfer Taxes and directly to the appropriate Person
the other costs and expenses to be paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement;
and

  

  

(iii) With respect to the amount of the Assumed Liabilities described in
Section 2.3, by the Purchaser assuming such Assumed Liabilities at the
Closing; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall satisfy such Assumed
Liabilities either at Closing or, in the Purchaser's sole discretion, in the
ordinary course of business.

  

  

(e) At the Closing, Purchaser will execute and deliver an appropriate
agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Sellers, Parent and
Purchaser, to implement and confirm the waiver of Parent described in Section
3.1(a)(vii).

(a) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser

\- 22 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Deposit shall be credited against the Purchase Price in accordance
with Section 3.1(a).

execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same.

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement as liquidated damages
and the Purchaser shall not incur further liability under this Agreement.
Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that the calculation of the damages
caused to Sellers is difficult to estimate at this time and that the amount of
the Deposit is a reasonable estimation of the amount of damages which would be
incurred by Sellers if this Agreement is terminated as a result of the
Purchaser's material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(c) In the event Sellers properly terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
4.4(g), or Section 4.4(i), then Sellers shall receive the Deposit as

contrary or any legal theory of any kind, if the transactions contemplated
hereby are not consummated for any reason, (i) the maximum Liability that the
Purchaser may have hereunder shall be forfeiture of the Deposit to Sellers and
(ii) the maximum Liability that Sellers shall have hereunder shall be the
return of the Deposit.

Liability under Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412 or 430. None of the
Seller Plans is subject to any Laws outside of the United States. There are no
Encumbrances under Section 412 or 430 of the Code or under ERISA on any of the
Purchased Assets.

  

  

(c) Each Seller Plan has been established, administered and invested in
accordance with its terms and in material compliance with all applicable Laws.
Sellers have performed and complied in all material respects with all of their
respective obligations under or with respect to the Seller Plans. Each Seller
Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code ("Qualified Plan") and each trust that is intended to be
exempt under Section 501 of the Code ("Exempt Trust") has received a
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that such Qualified Plan is so qualified and such Exempt Trust is so
exempt, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred since the date
of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter,
as applicable, that would materially and adversely affect the tax-qualified
status of any Qualified Plan or Exempt Trust. There has not been any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of ERISA and the Code) with respect
to any Seller Plan.

  

  

(d) Each Assumed Plan is a "welfare plan" subject to Section 3(2) of ERISA.
Each type of welfare benefit provided under each Assumed Plan is listed in
Section 5.14(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No Assumed Plan (or portion
thereof) is self-insured or subject to a "stop-loss" insurance policy or
contract. There are no participants in any Assumed Plan other than current or
former Employees of the Business (and their beneficiaries and dependents).
None of the Assumed Plans provide, or reflect or represent a Liability of the
Business to provide, retiree health or other retiree welfare benefits to any
current or former Employees of the Business for any reason, except as may be
required by COBRA and Sellers have not agreed, promised or represented that
they would provide retiree health or other retiree welfare benefits to any
current or former Employees of the Business.

2011 (the "Most Recent Balance Sheet") for HUSA, which Most Recent Balance

material respects, the financial condition of HUSA as of such dates and the

consistent, in all material respects, with the books and records of HUSA.

  

  

5.19 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in Section 5.19
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to Sellers\' Knowledge, Sellers do not have
any Liabilities, except (a) Liabilities reflected on the liabilities side of
the Most Recent Balance Sheet, (b) Liabilities that have arisen after the date

Laws. Sellers and the Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 9.7 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Sellers or
the Purchaser, as the case may be).

(c) Each of the Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Section 9.7, neither
the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required (i) to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or divest or otherwise dispose of, sell,
assign or transfer any of its businesses, product lines, assets, investments,
securities or rights of any kind or any of the Purchased Assets, or to enter
into any consent decree or settlement agreement with any Governmental Body,
(ii) to agree to any limitation on the operation or conduct of the Business,
(iii) to waive any of the conditions to this Agreement set forth in Sections
10.1 or 10.3, (iv) to waive its right to terminate this Agreement under
Section 4.4 or (v) to defend, contest or resist any action or proceeding or
seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

9.8 No Due Diligence Contingency. Subject to Article X, upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Sellers and the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
have no "due diligence contingency" under this Agreement and the Purchaser
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive the return of
the Deposit because the Purchaser discovered facts concerning Sellers and/or
the Business after the date hereof.

  

  

9.9 No Financing Contingency. Upon the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Sellers and the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall have no "financing
contingency" under this Agreement and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement and receive the return of the Deposit because the
Purchaser fails to secure sufficient financing to pay the Purchase Price.

  

  

9.10 Use of Name. Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
take such corporate and other actions necessary to change its corporate or
company name, as the case may be, to a name that is not similar to, or
confusing with, the current names of Sellers, including any necessary filings
required by the general corporation or other law of the states in which such
Sellers are incorporated, or otherwise organized.

  

  

9.11 Further Assurances.

  

  

(a) From time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration,
each of the parties hereto will (or, if appropriate, cause their Affiliates
to) execute and deliver such further instruments and take such other action as
may be necessary to make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If any party to this Agreement shall following the Closing have in
its possession any asset, right or payment that under this Agreement should
have been delivered to the other, such party shall promptly deliver such
asset, right or payment to the other party.

  

  

(b) Each Sellers, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, hereby
constitutes and appoints, effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser and its
successors and assigns as the true and lawful attorney of such Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, with full power of substitution in the name of
Purchaser, or in the name of such Seller or its respective Affiliates, as
applicable, but for the benefit of Purchaser, (i) to collect for the account
of Purchaser any items of Purchased Assets and (ii) to institute and prosecute
all proceedings that Purchaser may in its sole discretion deem proper to
assert or enforce any right, title or interest in, to or under the Purchased
Assets, and to defend or compromise any and all actions, suits or proceedings
in respect of the Purchased Assets. Purchaser shall be entitled to retain for
its own account any amounts collected pursuant to the foregoing powers,
including any amounts payable as interest in respect thereof.

effect" set forth in such representations and warranties) has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

TAXES

  

  

11.1 Additional Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Any sales, use, purchase, transfer, franchise, deed, fixed asset, stamp,
documentary stamp, use or other Taxes and recording charges which may be
payable by reason of the sale of the Purchased Assets or the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein shall be borne and timely paid by the Purchaser (collectively, the
"Transfer Taxes"), and the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend (with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser), protect, and save and hold Sellers
harmless from and against any and all claims, charges, interest or penalties
assessed, imposed or asserted in relation to any such Transfer Taxes.

  

  

(b) The Purchaser shall, within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, prepare and deliver to HUSA a schedule allocating the Purchase
Price (and any other items that are required for federal income tax purposes
to be treated as part of the purchase price) among the Purchased Assets (such
schedule, the "Allocation"). If HUSA raises any objection to the Allocation
within twenty (20) days of the receipt thereof, the Purchaser and HUSA will
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection(s); provided however, the
Purchaser and HUSA are not required to negotiate the treatment of any amount
associated with Section 3.1(a)(iii). If the Purchaser, Sellers and HUSA are
unable to agree upon an Allocation, they are not required to report and file
any Tax Returns (including Form 8594 under Section 1060 of the Code) in a
manner consistent with the Allocation but shall provide the other party prior
written notice of such intention. Subject to the foregoing, the Purchaser,
Sellers and HUSA shall cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form
8594 under Section 1060 of the Code) with respect to such Allocation,
including any amendments to such forms required pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Section
11.1(b) shall survive the Closing without limitation.

ARTICLE XII 
 

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

12.1 Payment of Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in
the DIP Loan Documents and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, Sellers and the Purchaser shall, subject to Section 12.12
below, bear their own expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

  

12.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of Confidentiality.
The parties hereto agree that the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement shall expire upon the Closing Date. The parties hereto agree
that the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the
Closing shall survive in accordance with the terms of the particular covenant
or until fully performed.

  

  

12.3 Guarantee.

  

  

(a) Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to
Sellers the due payment by the Purchaser of all of the Purchaser's payment
obligations under Article III of this Agreement and all of the Assumed
Liabilities assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Agreement
(the "Guaranteed Obligations"); provided, however, that Parent's obligation
pursuant to this Section 12.3(a) shall in no event exceed Two Hundred Million
Dollars ($200,000,000.00) in the aggregate.

  

  

(b) Parent's obligation pursuant to this Section 12.3(a) shall terminate on
the earlier of (i) the five (5) year anniversary of the Sale Order or (ii) the
date of final liquidation or dissolution of Sellers (such date, as determined,
the "Termination Date"), and Parent shall have no further obligations
hereunder except as to a claim for payment of any Guaranteed Obligation
presented by Sellers to Parent prior to such Termination Date, in which case,
Parent shall remain liable until the claim is paid in full or otherwise
resolved.

  

  

(c) Any request for payment by Parent to Sellers shall be in writing and shall
state with reasonable particularity the reasons for the payment request. This
guarantee is an unconditional guarantee of payment, not collection, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Parent
irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Purchaser and
irrespective of whether the Purchaser is joined in any such action or actions.
In addition to Parent's obligations under this Section 12.3, Parent shall be
legally bound by the terms and provisions of Article XII of this Agreement to
the same extent as the Purchaser is bound by the terms and provisions of
Article XII and each reference to "the Purchaser" in Article XII shall be
deemed to include "Parent" and "the Purchaser" for all purposes. Parent hereby
waives and releases any claim or other right Parent may have or hereafter
acquire against the Purchaser or that arises from the existence or performance
of Parent's obligations under this Section 12.3, including without limitation
any right of subrogation, setoff, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification, or any right of participation in any claim or remedy of
Sellers against the Purchaser under this Agreement. It is the intent and
purpose hereof that Parent shall be not entitled to any defenses available to
guarantors, sureties and other secondary parties at law or in equity (other
than the timely and complete performance of the guaranteed obligations by the
Purchaser). Sellers shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse against the
Purchaser before being entitled to demand and receive Parent's full and timely
performance of this guarantee pursuant to this Section 12.3. So long as the
Purchaser shall have not fully paid, performed or discharged all of its
obligations under this Agreement, any claim which Parent may have against the
Purchaser by reason of any payment to Sellers pursuant to this Section 12.3
shall not be asserted or enforced or collected as against (or to the detriment
of) the Purchaser, as the case may be (including without limitation any
liquidator, trustee in bankruptcy, assignee for the benefit of creditors or
receiver of property or assets of the Purchaser, as the case may be), or
Sellers in any action, suit or proceeding.

12.4 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) represents the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or changed, and any
provision hereof may be waived, only by written instrument making specific
reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of
any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any
investigation by or on behalf of any party shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All
remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies
provided by applicable Law.

  

  

12.5 Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement
may be executed (by facsimile or PDF signature) in any number of counterparts,
each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such
counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

  

  

12.6 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT IS TO BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, AND WHERE
STATE LAW IS IMPLICATED, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA SHALL GOVERN,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF, INCLUDING ALL
MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT IF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO HEAR ANY SUCH
DISPUTE, THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF
FLORIDA WILL HAVE SOLE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG
THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS

12.9 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Purchaser and, subject to entry of the Sale Order, Sellers, and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
including, without limitation, any trustee or estate representative appointed
in the Chapter 11 Case or any successor Chapter 7 case. Nothing in this
Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement except as
provided below. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by Sellers or the Purchaser (by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void; provided, that the Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder in whole or in part to one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Purchaser (subject to the next succeeding sentence). No assignment of any
obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to the Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

  

  

12.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

12.11 Injunctive Relief. The parties agree that damages at Law may be an
inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises and
agreements contained in this Agreement by Sellers, and, accordingly, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive relief with respect to any such
breach, including without limitation, specific performance of such covenants,
promises or agreements or an order enjoining Sellers from any threatened, or
from the continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or
agreements contained in this Agreement by Sellers. The rights set forth in
this Section 12.11 shall be in addition to any other rights which the
Purchaser may have at Law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

12.12 Non Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
advisor, lawyer, agent, representative, incorporator, member, partner or
equityholder of Sellers or the Purchaser shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of Sellers or the Purchaser under this Agreement or
Sellers' Documents or the Purchaser's Documents of or for any claim based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

  

  

12.13 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of each
of the obligations of the parties and with respect to all covenants and
conditions to be satisfied by the parties in this Agreement and all documents,
acknowledgments and instruments delivered in connection herewith.

Exhibits shall be deemed to refer to Articles, Sections, Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement.

  

  

(c) All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(d) The Article, Section and paragraph captions herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

  

  

(e) The words "include," "includes" and "including," when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"
(regardless of whether such words or similar words actually appear).

  

  

(f) When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded.

  

  

(g) Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars.

  

  

(h) Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all genders, and
words imparting the singular only shall include the plural and vice versa.

  

  

(i) The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and "hereunder" refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such
words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

  

  

(j) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

  

(k) The Purchaser acknowledges hereby that Sellers may not comply with the
provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(l) This Agreement may be executed in counterpart signature pages, all of
which when so executed and attached hereto shall constitute one and the same
original.
