ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

of the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements, on the Closing Date but prior to the
Effective Time and subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other

but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
the Company shall cause to be effected the Distribution, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements. Each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to so cooperate, such that the Distribution shall be

delay as reasonably possible between the consummation of the Distribution and
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the

Section 1.3. _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place

event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day, after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), or
at such other place or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Closing occur prior to
April 2, 2018, unless Parent specifies an earlier date on no less than five
(5) Business Days prior written notice to the Company. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.4. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date or time as
is specified in the

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate of Merger and agreed to by the parties hereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "), and the parties hereto shall make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL or other applicable
law in connection with the Merger.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set
forth herein, in the Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Company as the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company as the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) By virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time so as to read in its
entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_, and as so amended and restated shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the
Merger, until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided
by applicable Law (subject to _Section 5.6_).

 



 

(b) Effective at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be
amended and restated so as to read in their entirety in the form as is set
forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and as provided by applicable Law, until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms, in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by applicable Law
(subject to _Section 5.6_).

 



 

Section 1.7. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
to hold office until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their successor is duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 



 

Section 2.1. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of Parent or
Merger Sub, the following will occur:

 



 

(a) subject to the terms of this _Article II_, each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares
described in _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration,
payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon, less any applicable
withholding of Taxes, in the manner provided for in _Section 2.5_;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) each Share that is (i) held by the Company as treasury stock or (ii) owned
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; and

 



 

(c) each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) " _Merger Consideration_ " means $8.40 per share in cash prior to giving
effect to the Reverse Stock Split, _provided_ that, if the Reverse Stock Split
is effected prior to the Effective Time, "Merger Consideration" shall mean
$16.80 per share in cash after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split. For
the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, any fractional Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares
described in _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares), including any
fractional Shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, will be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the fraction
representing any such fractional share __multiplied by__ (ii) the Merger
Consideration, payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon and
rounded down to the nearest whole cent, less any applicable withholding of
Taxes, in the manner provided for in _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting _Section 5.2_, if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number or class of shares, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the
number of Shares will be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
Shares, LQ RSAs and LQ RSUs the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that (i) nothing in this paragraph
shall prohibit any action by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be
taken pursuant to the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements and (ii) no adjustment
shall be made pursuant to this paragraph as a result of the Distribution or
the other transactions expressly contemplated by the Spin-Off Agreements
(including the Reverse Stock Split, which is governed by the provisions of
_Section 2.1(d)_); _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this paragraph
shall permit any action by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement (including _Section 5.2_).

 



 

Section 2.2. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
LQ Equity Plan) will take the actions with respect to the LQ Equity Plan
contemplated by Article IV of the Employee Matters Agreement and all actions,
including the obtaining of any required waivers or consents, as it deems
(without payment of any additional compensation therefor) necessary or
appropriate to give effect to this _Section 2.2_ to provide that:

 



 

(a) _Treatment of LQ RSAs_. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and a
holder in writing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each LQ RSA that
is then outstanding shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, vest and become free of restrictions as of the
Effective Time and be cancelled and terminated, and each holder of an LQ RSA
shall have the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in respect of

 



      
 

 



 

such LQ RSA, an amount in cash (less applicable withholding Taxes, if any)
equal to (A) the number of Shares subject to such LQ RSA, _multiplied by_ (B)
the Merger Consideration, payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of LQ RSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and a
holder in writing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, any vesting
conditions applicable to each LQ RSU that is then outstanding shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, accelerate in full, and such LQ RSU shall be cancelled and
terminated, and each holder of an LQ RSU shall have the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation, in respect of such LQ RSU, an amount in cash (less
applicable withholding Taxes, if any) equal to (A) the number of Shares
previously subject to such LQ RSU award, _multiplied by_ (B) the Merger
Consideration, payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

 



 

(c) _Termination of LQ Equity Plan_. Subject to _Section 2.2(d)_, at or prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the LQ Equity Plan and any
other Company Plan (or provision thereof) that provides for the issuance or
grant of any interest in respect of Shares. As of the Effective Time, neither
the Company nor any of the Retained Subsidiaries shall be bound by any
obligations under the LQ Equity Plan or any other Company Plan (or provision
thereof) that provides for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
Shares, except for the Companys obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of LQ ESPP_. Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall adopt such
resolutions to take such other actions as may be required to provide that with
respect to the LQ ESPP: (i) participation following the date of this Agreement
shall be limited to those employees who actively participate in such LQ ESPP
as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) participants may not increase their
payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of
this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced or extended after
the date of this Agreement, (iv) each participants outstanding right to

immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not
earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the LQ ESPP); _provided_ , that
all amounts allocated to each participants account under the LQ ESPP as of
such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole Shares at
the applicable price determined under the existing terms of the LQ ESPP for
the then-outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase
date for each such offering period, and (v) assuming the occurrence of the
Effective Time, the LQ ESPP shall terminate immediately following such
purchases of Shares and in any event immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Payments in respect of LQ RSAs and LQ RSUs_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Surviving
Corporation (on behalf of and as agent of the holders of LQ RSAs or LQ RSUs)
the portion of the aggregate consideration payable in respect of LQ RSAs and

paid to such holders by the Company through its payroll system as part of its
next full payroll cycle that is at least five (5) Business Days following the
Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has duly demanded appraisal under and otherwise complied in all respects with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal.
From and after the Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised
such appraisal rights will not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those
provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him,
her or it in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or
its right to appraisal, in which case such Shares will be treated as if they
had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time, without interest thereon, upon surrender of certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.4(f)_) or book-
entry shares, pursuant to _Section 2.4_. Parent shall promptly deposit with
the Paying Agent any additional funds necessary to pay in full the aggregate
Merger Consideration so due and payable to such stockholder who shall have
withdrawn or lost such right to obtain payment of the fair market value of
such Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such demands), attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
appraisal.

 



 

(c) The Proxy Statement shall include a notice complying with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL concerning the rights of the stockholders of the
Company to exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Merger and a copy of
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), to act as agent for the
stockholders of the Company to receive payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to
be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount in immediately available
funds sufficient to pay the stockholders of the Company (other than any
holders of any Shares described in _Section 2.1(b)_ and any holders of
Dissenting Shares) the aggregate consideration payable to the holders of

 



      
 

 



 

Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (but which cash shall not, for the
avoidance of doubt, be for payments in respect of LQ RSAs or LQ RSUs, which
shall be paid by the Company through its payroll system as part of its next
full payroll cycle that is at least five (5) Business Days following the
Closing Date). Such cash may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares and,
following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount
of any such losses and (ii) such investments will be in short-term obligations
of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30)
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced
by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs.

 



 

(c) _Letter of Transmittal; Surrender of Shares_. Promptly after the Effective
Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or evidence of a book-entry share, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, whose Shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate or book-entry shares
will pass only upon delivery of the certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.4(f)_) to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of book-entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in such
letter of transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions acceptable to the Company and Parent) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
certificates or book-entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in _Section 2.4(f)_) or book-entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such Letter of Transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such certificate or book-entry Share will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (less any
required withholding Taxes) for each Share formerly represented by such
certificate or book-entry Share, and the certificate or book-entry Share so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the certificates or book-entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such certificates or book-entry
Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.4(c)_, each
certificate or book-entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and will
not evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a
stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Merger Exchange Fund_. At any time following the date that
is one (1) year after the Effective Time, Parent will be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and
that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates and book-entry Shares
(including all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such
Shares), and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

payable upon surrender of their certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) and book-entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation will pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. None of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
portion of the funds delivered to the Paying Agent hereunder that is delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
such date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration unclaimed by such holders
of certificates and book-entry Shares (including all dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such Shares) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) _Stock Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company will be closed, and thereafter there will be no further
registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, certificates and book-entry Shares
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer will be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in, this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Shares_. In the event that any certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders delivery of an affidavit of
loss to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares represented by such certificate.

 



 

Section 2.5. _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation (or any of their agents) will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards or
any other recipient of consideration pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under the Code or the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or pursuant to any other Law. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts (i) shall be promptly
remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the Merger is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
certificate or book-entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it will be a
condition of payment that the certificate or book-entry Share, as applicable,
so surrendered will be properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a
Person other than the registered holder of the certificate or book-entry
Share, as applicable, surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Any other
transfer Taxes shall be paid by Parent or the Company when due, except as
otherwise provided for in the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements.

and (ii) limitations on transfer under Law), except where any such failure to
own any such shares or

which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or a

of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

 



 

Section 3.6. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) _Company SEC Filings_. The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted to
the SEC all required reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses,
and registration, proxy

 



      
 

 



 

and other statements required to be filed by it with the SEC, since December
31, 2015. None of the Retained Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any
reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of their respective
filing dates, or, if amended or superseded after the date of filing, as of the
date of the last such amendment or applicable subsequent filing, each of the
SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. Except to the
extent amended or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC made prior to
the date hereof, as of their respective dates (and if so amended or
superseded, then as of the date of the last such amendment or applicable
subsequent filing), none of the SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation is made as to the
accuracy of any financial projections or forward-looking statements or the
completeness of any information furnished by the Company to the SEC solely for
purposes of complying with Regulation FD under the Exchange Act. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
received from the SEC with respect to any of the SEC Reports and, to the
knowledge of the Company, none of the SEC Reports is the subject of any
outstanding SEC investigation.

 



 

(b) _Company Consolidated Financial Statements_. The audited and unaudited
consolidated financial statements (including the related notes thereto) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Companys Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the Companys Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2017, June 30,
2017 and September 30, 2017 (the " _Financial Statements_ "), as amended or
supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects (except, in the case of
unaudited quarterly Financial Statements, as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects in conformity with GAAP the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of cash
flows, as well as the stockholders equity for the periods indicated therein

and recurring year-end audit adjustments and as indicated in the notes
thereto, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has implemented and maintains a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) under
the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, such system of internal control over financial reporting is
effective. For purposes of this _Section 3.6(c)_, "knowledge of the Company"
means the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company and will not have the meaning ascribed
thereto in _Exhibit A_. The Company has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act)
that are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames
specified by the SECs rules and forms (and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective),

 



      
 

 



 

and has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its system of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses known to it in the
design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud known to it,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2015
through the date hereof, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company
Board or the audit committee of the Company Board has received any written
notification of any fraud or alleged fraud that (x) to the knowledge of the
Company or the Company Board, resulted in any material internal investigation
or (y) involved management or other employees who have a significant role in
financial reporting or internal controls over financial reporting.

 



 

(d) _Financial Statements of Management and Franchise Business_. Attached as
Section 3.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter are true, correct and complete
copies of the audited combined balance sheet of the Management and Franchise
Business as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and the related
audited combined statements of operations, combined statements of changes in
equity and combined statements of cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015 and related notes thereto (the " _Management and Franchise Business
Financial Statements_ "). The Management and Franchise Business Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved and fairly present
in all material respects in conformity with GAAP the combined financial
position of the Management and Franchise Business at the dates thereof and the
combined statements of operations, combined statements of cash flows, as well
as the stockholders equity for the periods indicated therein.

 



 

(e) _No Undisclosed Liability_. Neither the Company nor any of the Retained
Subsidiaries has any liabilities of a nature required by GAAP to be reflected
in or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto),
other than liabilities that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the most
recent financial statements included in the SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement or in the Management and Franchise Business Financial
Statements or are reflected in the respective notes thereto, (ii) were
incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice
since the date of such financial statements, (iii) are incurred pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by, and in accordance with, this Agreement, (iv)

Financing Commitment on the part of CPLG (or, to the knowledge of the Company,
any CPLG Debt Financing Source), or (C) otherwise result in the funds
contemplated to be available under the CPLG Financing Commitment on the
Closing Date, which is sufficient for CPLG to make the Cash Payment (as such
term is defined in the Distribution Agreement), to not be available to CPLG on
a timely basis (and in any event as of the Closing Date). As of the date
hereof, CPLG has not received any notice or other communication from any party
to the CPLG Financing Commitment with respect to (i) any actual or potential
breach or default on the part of CPLG or any other party to the CPLG Financing
Commitment, or (ii) any intention of such party to terminate the CPLG
Financing Commitment or to not provide all or any portion of the CPLG Debt
Financing in an amount necessary to finance the Cash Payment (as such term is
defined in the Distribution Agreement). As of the date hereof, to the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_
hereof, would reasonably be expected to (A) cause the CPLG Financing
Commitment to terminate or to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded,
or (B) otherwise cause the funds contemplated to be available under the CPLG
Financing Commitment on the Closing Date, which is sufficient for CPLG to make
the Cash Payment (as such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement), to
not be available to CPLG on a timely basis (and in any event on a basis to
permit the Closing to occur as of the Closing Date). As of the date hereof,
there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the CPLG Debt Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the CPLG Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, there are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for
customary engagement letters which do not contain provisions that impose any
additional conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the CPLG Debt
Financing), whether written or oral, related to the funding of the full amount
of the CPLG Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the CPLG Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, subject
to the terms and conditions of the CPLG Financing Commitment, and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the CPLG Financing Commitment will be sufficient for CPLG to
make the Cash Payment (as such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement)
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement
on the Closing Date.

investigation thereof. Except for the representations and warranties contained
in _Article III_ hereof (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter) or the
Spin-Off Transaction Agreements, the Company hereby disclaims all liability
and responsibility, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, for. Without

any projection or forecast regarding future results or activities or the
probable success or profitability of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any

documents or information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries made
available to each of Parent or Merger Sub or their Representatives in any
"data room," confidential memorandum, other offering materials or otherwise,
except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty
set forth in _Article III_ or the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_, none of Parent
or any of Parents Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling Persons, agents or other
Representatives or any other Person has made or makes, and the Company hereby
disclaims reliance on, any other representation or warranty, express or
implied, whether written or oral, on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, controlling Persons, agents or other representatives or any other
Person.

the Company that, except as set forth on the Parent Disclosure Letter (it
being understood that any information set forth in a particular section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds

such concept is applicable, is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign corporation or entity authorized to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the character of the properties or assets owned or held under lease

their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets
are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflict, violation, breach, default, acceleration, loss, right or other
occurrence that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and the consummation of the Merger by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not

Section 4.11. _Parent Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to Company a true, complete and correct copy of a
fully executed debt commitment letter, and fully executed fee letter
referenced in such commitment letter ( _provided_ , that the fee amounts,
market flex provisions, securities demand provisions and other economic terms
may be redacted) (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and joinders thereto, as the same may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended or replaced from time to time in compliance with
_Section 5.21(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Initial Debt Commitment
Letter_ "), among Merger Sub and the Parent Debt Financing Sources party
thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, the Parent Debt Financing
Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Initial Debt
Commitment Letter, to provide or cause to be provided, on a several and not
joint basis, the financing commitments described therein.

 



 

(b) The Initial Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date hereof, in full
force and effect. The Initial Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date
hereof, the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Merger Sub
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (except to the
extent enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally and except as the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies and those providing for
equitable defenses may be limited by equitable principles of general
applicability). As of the date hereof, the Initial Debt Commitment Letter has
not been amended, modified, supplemented, extended or replaced. As of the date
hereof, (i) neither Merger Sub nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
counterparty thereto is in breach of any of its covenants or other obligations
set forth in, or is in default under, the Initial Debt Commitment Letter and
(ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or

 



      
 

 



 

both, would or would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute or result in a
breach or default on the part of Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of Parent,
any Parent Debt Financing Source) under the Initial Debt Commitment Letter,
(B) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition or other
contingency set forth in the Initial Debt Commitment Letter on the part of
Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of Parent, any Parent Debt Financing Source),
or (C) otherwise result in the funds contemplated to be available under the
Initial Debt Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, which is sufficient for
Parent and Merger Sub, together with currently available cash and cash
equivalents, to fund the Merger Consideration, and any other amounts payable
by Parent, Merger Sub at the Closing in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all related fees and expenses
of Parent and Merger Sub required to be paid at the Closing in connection
therewith (the " _Parent Required Amount_ "), to not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub on a timely basis (and in any event prior to the Closing Date). As
of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has received any notice or
other communication from any party to the Initial Debt Commitment Letter with
respect to (i) any actual or potential breach or default on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub or any other party to the Initial Debt Commitment Letter, or
(ii) any intention of such party to terminate the Initial Debt Commitment
Letter or to not provide all or any portion of the Initial Debt Commitment
Letter in an amount necessary, together with currently available cash and cash
equivalents, to finance the Parent Required Amount. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ hereof, would
reasonably be expected to (A) cause the Initial Debt Commitment Letter to
terminate or to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded, or (B)
otherwise cause the funds contemplated to be available under the Initial Debt
Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, which is sufficient for Parent,
together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, to fund the
Parent Required Amount, to not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on a
timely basis (and in any event, on a basis to permit the Closing to occur as
of the Closing Date). As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Initial Debt Commitment Letter other than as expressly set forth in the
Initial Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, there are no side
letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements, whether written or
oral, related to the funding of the full amount of the Parent Debt Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Initial
Debt Commitment Letter, or which do not contain provisions that impose any
additional conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Parent Debt
Financing. As of the date hereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Initial Debt Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Initial Debt
Commitment Letter will be sufficient for Parent, together with currently
available cash and cash equivalents, to fund the Parent Required Amount upon
the terms contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 4.12. _Eligible Independent Contractor Status_. At the Effective Time
and taking into account the Merger, the Company will qualify as an "eligible
independent contractor" with respect to CPLG for purposes of Section 856(d)(9)

reports filed with the SEC with respect to the Company.

sharing with Parent and Merger Sub or their Representative, or Parents or
Merger Subs use of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or

warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ or the Spin-Off Transaction
Agreements, it is understood and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that any
cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any data, any financial
information or any memoranda or offering materials or presentations provided

expressly set forth in _Article III_ or the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, to the Companys express disavowal and disclaimer of any other
representations and warranties, whether made by the Company or any other

any representation, warranty, projections, forecasts or other materials made
available to Parent or Merger Sub, including any opinion, information,
projection, forecast or other information that may have been or may be
provided to Parent or Merger Sub by any director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or other Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
except in the case of fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in
limitation thereof, Parent and Merger specifically acknowledge and agree that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ or the representations and warranties or other provisions of the Spin-Off

acknowledges and agrees that (i) such projections or forecasts are being
provided solely for the convenience of Parent to facilitate its own
independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections or forecasts,
(iii) Parent is familiar with such uncertainties and (iv) Parent is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness of the
underlying assumptions). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have
conducted to their satisfaction their own independent investigation of the
condition, operations and businesses of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries and acknowledges that they have been provided adequate access to
the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and information of the Companies for such purpose and, in making its
determination to proceed with the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub have

 



       
 

 



 

been provided and have evaluated such documents and information as they have
deemed necessary, have been advised by their counsel, accountants, financial
advisors and such other Persons as Parent and Merger Sub have deemed
appropriate concerning this Agreement, and have relied solely on the results
of their own independent investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ and the
Spin-Off Transaction Agreements.

hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_, no other statutory, express or implied
representation or warranty, whether written or oral, concerning the Shares,
the Merger or the business, assets or liabilities of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or any other transaction agreements or any other matter, including
any implied warranties of merchantability and implied warranties of fitness
for a particular purpose, is or has been made.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_, to the extent permitted by Law, the Company will, (i) upon
reasonable advance written notice from Parent, give Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to relevant employees and facilities and to relevant books, contracts
and records (including Tax Returns) of the Company and the Retained
Subsidiaries and cause the Companys Representatives to provide access to
their work papers and such other information as Parent or Merger Sub may
reasonably request (including information regarding the transactions set forth

with respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company and the

request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties.

 



 

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_
will constitute "Information" under the Confidentiality Agreement and will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to any
debt financing sources or prospective debt financing sources that may become
parties to the Parent Debt Financing or rating agencies (and, in each case, to
their respective counsel and auditors) so long as each such Person is made
aware of and acknowledges the confidential nature of such information and
agrees to be bound by confidentiality and use restrictions customary for the
syndication of the debt financing contemplated by such debt financing sources
and substantially consistent with the confidentiality

 



      
 

 



 

and use restrictions contemplated by the Confidentiality Agreement or in the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, no such

the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or
any competitively or commercially sensitive information or information
relating to the analysis or consideration of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose
information that, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Company, is
subject to attorney-client privilege or may conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, (iv)
would reasonably be likely to violate the terms of any Material Contract with
a third party, in each case, that was in effect prior to the execution of this
Agreement ( _provided_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure or develop an alternative method of providing such information to
Parent), or (v) would reasonably be likely to violate any Law ( _provided_ ,
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such access
or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate such Law or develop

the Company shall not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, or employees to, and the Company shall not
permit the Representatives of the Company to, (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries with respect to, or the making
of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations or discussions
concerning, or provide access to its or its Subsidiaries properties, books
and records or any confidential information or data to, any Person relating to
an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, offer or inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) amend or
grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill or similar
agreement, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (v) execute or enter into,
any letter of intent, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "); _provided_
that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the
Company Board or the Company expressly permitted under _Section 5.4(b)_ or
_Section 5.4(c)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach or violation of this
_Section 5.4(a)_ or, in the case of _Section 5.4(b)(i)_ _(v)_ , give Parent
a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, in each case that exists as of the date hereof.
The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person (other than
the parties hereto) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the date hereof. The Company

 



      
 

 



 

shall promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt thereof)
notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal, offer or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof, which notice shall include a
summary of the material terms of and the identity of the Person making, such
Acquisition Proposal, other proposal, offer or inquiry and the Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects on a
reasonably current basis of any substantive developments (including any
material change to the terms thereof) regarding any such Acquisition Proposal
and shall promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt) provide
to Parent copies of all substantive written requests, proposals, offers or
proposed agreements received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
describe any terms or conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a
waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to the extent necessary to allow for a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be
made to the Company or the Company Board if the Company Board determines after
consultation with legal counsel to the Company that the failure to waive or
release such provision would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.4(a)_, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board
from:

 



 

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of
the Company) or from making any disclosure to stockholders that the Company
determines is legally required, including with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that
nothing set forth in this _Section 5.4(b)(i)_ shall be deemed to (x) modify
or supplement the definition of "Change of Board Recommendation" or (y) permit
the Company or the Company Board to make a Change of Board Recommendation
except as otherwise permitted pursuant to _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.8(f)_
(for the avoidance of doubt, the issuance by the Company or the Company Board
of any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company) which does not effect a
Change of Board Recommendation shall not in and of itself constitute a Change
of Board Recommendation));

 



 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, contacting and
engaging in discussions with any Person or group and their respective
Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof
that was not solicited in breach of _Section 5.4(a)_, solely for the purpose
of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof;

 



 

(iii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, providing access
to its properties, books and records and providing information or data in
response to a request therefor by a Person or group who has made an
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that was not solicited in breach of
_Section 5.4(a)_, if (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute, result in or lead to a Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, (B) the Company has received from the Person so requesting such
information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (C) promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) after furnishing or making available any
non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to any such
Person, the Company furnishes or makes available such information to Parent or
its Representatives (to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished or made available by the Company to Parent or its Representatives);

 



 

(iv) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, contacting and
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person or group and their
respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof that was not solicited in breach of _Section 5.4(a)_ (which
negotiations or discussions need not be solely for clarification purposes) if
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead
to a Superior Proposal; or

 



 

(v) prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, making a Change of
Board Recommendation (to the extent permitted by _Section 5.4(c)_ or _Section
5.4(d)_, as applicable, and _Section 5.8(f)_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, if, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisor, in response to an Acquisition Proposal received after the
date hereof that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.4(a)_,
that such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company or the Company
Board may make a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company will not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ or
effect a Change of Board Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (a "
_Company Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to take
such action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board and all
material documents relating thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 5.4(c)_ with respect to such new written notice
(it being understood that the Notice Period in respect of such new written
notice shall expire at 5:00 pm New York City time on the second (2nd) Business
Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered such new
written notice), (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Superior
Proposal, as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (iii) (A) the Company Board
shall have considered in good faith any proposed changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the day on which the
Company delivered the Company Notice (such period from the time the Company
Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the third (3rd)
Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the
Company Notice, the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board, taking into
account any

 



      
 

 



 

proposed changes to this Agreement proposed during the Notice Period, shall
have again made the determination required by clause (ii) of this _Section
5.4(c)_ and (B) in the case of any termination of this Agreement in order to
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement for a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have complied
in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.4_ and,
concurrently therewith or prior thereto, have paid the Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 7.5(b)_. If requested by Parent, the Company shall
have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company
or its Subsidiaries, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval take or fail to take the actions specified in
clauses (i) or (iii) of the definition of Change of Board Recommendation (and
the Company shall not be required to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that, (i) the Company notified Parent in writing at least three (3) Business
Days before taking such action of its intention to do so, attaching a
reasonably detailed description of the basis of such proposed action; and (ii)
after such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, and
taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement made during such period, that the failure to take such action would
still be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, during such Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Intervening Event
would cease to warrant a Change of Board Recommendation.

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or

ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain for each individual
employed by the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries at the Effective Time and
who (i) remains employed by the Surviving Corporation or the Retained
Subsidiaries or (ii) becomes employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Surviving Corporation or the Retained Subsidiaries), in each

compensation and annual target cash incentive compensation at least as
favorable to such Current Employee as at the Effective Time and (B) benefits
provided under employee benefit plans of Parent or its Affiliates that in the
aggregate are substantially similar to the benefits (excluding any equity or
equity-based, nonqualified deferred compensation, change in control or
retention arrangements) maintained for and provided to such Current Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 5.5_ will prevent the amendment or termination of any
particular Company Plan or the termination of employment of any Current
Employee or interfere with the Surviving Corporations or any Retained
Subsidiarys right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary, or act
in any other manner, to conform with applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company employee may have
under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of the Retained Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Closing and
ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related

Company Disclosure Letter, as in effect on, and in the form provided to Parent
prior to, the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Current Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, under any defined benefit
plan) under employee benefit plans of Parent or its Affiliates, the Surviving
Corporation and the Retained Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service
was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans for those
purposes, except where such service credit would result in the duplication of
benefits. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure
that (i) Current Employees will not be subject to any eligibility requirements
or pre-existing condition limitations under any employee health benefit plan
of Parent or its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation or the Retained
Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) Current Employees are given credit under such
employee benefit plans for pre-Closing co-payments made and amounts paid

Retained Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their terms as in effect
on, and to the extent disclosed to Parent prior to, the date hereof, (i) each
existing employment, change in control, severance and termination protection

Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee, (ii) existing equity-based
plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans or programs and (iii) all

program or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries and similar
employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements still in
effect as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement in their capacities as such. No provision of this
_Section 5.5_ shall (i) give any third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this _Section 5.5_, (ii) obligate Parent, the Company, any
Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing to retain the
employment of any particular employee for any period of time or preclude
Parent, the Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing from terminating the employment of any such employee at any time and
for any or no reason, (iii) be deemed to constitute the adoption of, or an
amendment to, any Company Plan or other employee benefit arrangement governing
any current or former employee or individual consultant of Parent, the
Company, any Retained Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, or
(iv) prohibit or limit the ability of Parent, the Company, any Retained
Subsidiary or any Affiliate to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs,

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer and employee of the Company (including in their capacity as
fiduciary under any LQ Equity Plan) (in each case, when acting in any such
capacity) (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,

 



       
 

 



 

liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened Proceeding, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee
of the Company or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to
the Effective Time), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding, including any
expenses incurred in enforcing such Persons rights under this _Section 5.6_,
to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
and advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any
Retained Subsidiary; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 5.6_; _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required
to be made with respect to whether an employees, officers or directors
conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws shall be made by independent counsel selected by
the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither
Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities of the Indemnified Parties than are currently
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
indemnification agreements currently in place between the Company and any such
Persons and set forth on Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, or, in
the event that any Proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during
such period, until the disposition of any such Proceeding or claim, unless
such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Laws, in
which case Parent agrees, and will cause the Surviving Corporation, to make
such changes to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the
least adverse effect on the rights of the individuals referenced in this
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall (and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to) purchase and fully pay
by the Effective Time, at no expense to the beneficiaries, tail policies to
the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained
at such time by the Company from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance, which tail policies (i) will be effective for a period from the
Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years after the
Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement, the Distribution Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby or thereby), and (ii) will contain coverage that is at
least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by

 



      
 

 



 

such existing policies. Parent will cause such policies to be maintained in
full force and effect for their full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy in place as of the date of
this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase the best available directors and officers liability insurance
policy for such six (6)-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance
policies with terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums

Meeting, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were

Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish the Company with all
information reasonably requested by the Company and required pursuant to the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set

of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the
Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent,
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
the CPLG Registration Statement, so that the Proxy Statement, the CPLG
Registration Statement or the other filings shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the

to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such documents or responses and shall reasonably consider comments reasonably
proposed by Parent in such documents or responses. Nothing in this _Section

reasonable action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and
approving the Company Charter Amendments (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Stockholders
Meeting shall be held within forty-five (45) days following the Proxy
Statement having been cleared by the SEC, unless otherwise agreed in writing
by the parties hereto; _provided_ , that the Company may postpone, recess or
adjourn such meeting (i) to the extent required by applicable law (including
the exercise of fiduciary duties under applicable law), (ii) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the
Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, (iii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or

 



      
 

 



 

amended disclosure and then only for the minimum time which the Company Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel is
necessary under applicable law (including the exercise of fiduciary duties
under applicable law) for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

(f) The Company, acting through the Company Board (or a committee thereof),
shall, (i) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation
and, subject to the consent of the Companys financial advisor, the Fairness
Opinion, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval and (iii) not effect a Change of Board Recommendation;
_provided_ , that the Company Board may fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or otherwise effect a Change of Board
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.4_ if the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel to the
Company, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company shall have complied with
its obligations under _Section 5.4(c)_ or _Section 5.4(d)_, as applicable.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Distribution_.

 



 

(a) The Company will use reasonable best efforts to effect the transactions

Time. Prior to the Effective Time, any changes proposed by any party hereto to
any of the Spin-Off Transaction Agreements from the forms attached to this
Agreement as Annex A or Annex B shall be subject to the prior written approval
of the other party hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Following the execution of the Spin-Off Transaction
Agreements, the Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, alter, amend or otherwise revise the Spin-Off Transaction
Agreements, or waive any term thereof or any condition to the obligations
thereunder, without the prior approval of Parent (which approval shall not be

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall form a special
separation committee (the " _Separation Committee_ ") comprised of an equal
number of members appointed by the Company and Parent, which Separation
Committee shall discuss and monitor the restructuring transactions set forth
in the Plan of Reorganization for the transfer of the Separated Real Estate
Business in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement and the
other Spin-Off Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Separation Committee shall ensure that the members of the
Separation Committee appointed by Parent are kept reasonably informed with
respect to the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization and the Company
shall consider in good faith timely and reasonable input from Parent with
respect thereto. The Separation Committee will meet as often as its members
deem is necessary, but at least once per month and upon the reasonable request
of the Company or Parent, as applicable, and such meetings will be held
telephonically unless otherwise agreed between the parties. The Separation
Committee will have access, consistent with _Section 5.3_, to the Companys
and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries properties, books and records, Contracts and appropriate senior-
level officers and employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Separation
Committee will neither control, direct nor interfere with day to day
management or operations of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely
discharge by the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal
duties.

any rule or regulation of the New York Stock Exchange or any other stock
exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release in advance of such
issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release, to the extent so required, will be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party. The restrictions of this _Section 5.10_ will not apply to

other modification or replacement of, or any termination or reduction of, or
grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy or other provision under the CPLG

use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources (the " _Parent Alternate Financing_ ") (x) on

doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Parent Debt Financing Agreements), and (ii) otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Parent Debt Financing.

funding the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and such

Financing to be held in escrow (or similar arrangement) pending the
consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, then such

release of such funds (taken as a whole) are no more onerous than the Debt
Commitment Letter.

not be satisfied and such breach or failure is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date or is not cured in accordance with the following proviso;

to this _Section 7.4(a)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true has not
been cured within twenty (20) days after written notice by Parent to the
Company informing the Company of such breach or failure or if less than twenty
(20) days prior to the Outside Date, by the Outside Date, except that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the Outside Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in breach of this Agreement in any material respect; or

 



       
 

 



 

(b) if (i) a Change of Board Recommendation shall have occurred (it being
understood and agreed that, for all purposes of this Agreement, a
communication in accordance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
similar communication to the stockholders of the Company in connection with
the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer, shall not be deemed to
constitute a Change of Board Recommendation (so long as any action or
statement made to so comply is consistent with _Section 5.4_)) or (ii) the
Company Board shall have otherwise failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to stockholders (it being
agreed that the taking of any action by the Company, the Company Board or any
of its Representatives expressly permitted under _Section 5.4(b)_, _Section
5.4(c)_ or _Section 5.8(e)(ii)_ shall not give rise to a right to terminate
pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will
not have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.4(b)_ if the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _Article VII_, this Agreement (other than _Section
5.3(b)_ ( _Access to Information; Confidentiality_ ), _Section 5.10_ (
_Public Announcements_ ), this _Section 7.5_, and _Article VIII_ ( _General
Provisions_ ), and the Confidentiality Agreement) will become void and of no
effect with no liability on the part of any party (or of any of its
Representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor the
Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_; or

 



 

(iii) (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking
of a vote to adopt this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made directly to the Companys stockholders, or an Acquisition Proposal shall
have otherwise become publicly known, and in each case such Acquisition
Proposal shall have not been withdrawn in a bona fide manner prior to such
taking of a vote to adopt this Agreement, (B) thereafter, this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.2(b) _or _Section
7.2(c)_, or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ (with respect to a breach
of _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.8_), and (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with
respect to a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or Other
Proposal (which is subsequently consummated), or a transaction in respect of
any Acquisition Proposal or Other Proposal is consummated, within twelve (12)
months of the date this Agreement is terminated;

 



 

then in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$37,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts

 



      
 

 



 

designated by Parent. Any payment required to be made (1) pursuant to clause

termination of this Agreement, (2) pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section
7.5(b)_ shall be paid promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following termination of this Agreement and (3) pursuant to clause (iii) of
this _Section 7.5(b)_ shall be paid promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal or
Other Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be required
to pay the Termination Fee more than once or to pay both the Termination Fee
and the CPLG Financing Termination Fee. For purposes of _Section
7.5(b)(iii)(C)_, "Acquisition Proposal" will have the meaning ascribed thereto
in _Section 5.4(e)(i)_, except that the references in the definition to
"twenty percent (20%)" will be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)". If Parent
receives full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section
7.5(b)_, except in the case of fraud: (i) the collection of such fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and (ii) none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

 



 

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.2(b)_ and the Company shall not have delivered a CPLG Financing Certificate
to Parent on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Stockholders
Meeting or (ii) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ and the Company shall not have delivered a CPLG Financing
Certificate to Parent on the date of such termination or the date that is one
(1) Business Day prior to such termination or (y) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ and (A) on the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to
such termination, Parent shall have requested in writing a CPLG Financing
Certificate from the Company and (B) the Company shall not have delivered a
CPLG Financing Certificate to Parent on the date of such request or on the
date that is two (2) Business Day prior to such termination, the Company shall
pay Parent a termination fee of $37,000,000 (the " _CPLG Financing Termination
Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by Parent. Any payment required to be made pursuant to
this _Section 7.5(c)_ shall be paid promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company will not be required to pay the CPLG Financing Termination
Fee more than once or to pay both the CPLG Financing Termination Fee and the
Termination Fee. If Parent receives full payment of the CPLG Financing
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.5(c)_ and does not, prior to or
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt
thereof, reject and return such payment: (i) the collection of such fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and (ii) none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), in the case
of fraud.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in _Section
7.5(b)_ and _Section 7.5(c)_ are integral parts of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that such amounts do not constitute a penalty
and that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
If the Company fails to pay Parent the amounts due under _Section 7.5(b)_ or
_Section 7.5(c)_, as applicable, within the time periods specified in such
sections, the Company shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts.
