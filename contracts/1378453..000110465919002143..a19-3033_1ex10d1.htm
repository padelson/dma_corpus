Party_ "), the other party (a " _Cooperating Party_ ") shall take all such
actions as may be reasonably requested by the Requesting Party in order to
effectuate all or any part of the transactions contemplated by this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement as a forward or reverse like-kind exchange for the benefit of the
Requesting Party in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code
and, in the case of a reverse exchange, Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37; provided, however, the Cooperating Party shall not be
obligated to bear (and the Requesting Party shall reimburse the Cooperating
Party for) any out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by the Cooperating Party
in connection with such cooperation other than the Cooperating Partys
incidental counsel fees related to such cooperation. In furtherance of this
Section 4.7 and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Requesting Party may assign its rights under this Agreement to a
"qualified intermediary" or an "exchange accommodation titleholder" in order
to facilitate a forward or reverse like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of
the Internal Revenue Code, and the Cooperating Party agrees to execute and
deliver an acknowledgment and consent to any such assignment by the Requesting
Party of its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary or an
exchange accommodation titleholder; provided, however, such assignment shall
not relieve the Requesting Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Cooperating Party agrees that it shall execute and
deliver to the Requesting Party or the qualified intermediary at or prior to
the Closing any and all documents reasonably required or requested by such
Requesting Party or the qualified intermediary to complete such exchange;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, neither party shall be required to (a) accept
title to any property other than the Properties, (b) expend additional amounts
of money above those amount for which it is obligated under this Agreement,
(c) extend the Closing Date, or (d) incur any other material liability or
obligation.

contrary contained herein, the obligation of TA Purchaser to proceed with the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement is expressly conditioned upon the
fulfillment by and as of the Closing Date of each of the conditions listed
below, provided that TA Purchaser, at its election, evidenced by written
notice delivered to HPT Sellers, may waive all or any of such conditions: (a)
HPT Parties shall have executed and delivered to TA Purchaser all of the

contrary contained herein, the obligation of HPT Sellers to proceed with the

notice delivered to TA Purchaser, may waive all or any of such conditions: (a)
TA Parties shall have executed and delivered to HPT Sellers all of the
documents, and shall have taken or caused to be taken all of the other action
(including, without limitation, delivery of the Purchase Price to escrow

representations and warranties made by TA Parties in this Agreement shall be
true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date.

 



     

 

 



 

4.10 _Failure to Close_. If the Closing does not occur on the Closing Date as
a result of any partys material default of its covenants or obligations under
this Agreement, then the non-defaulting party may elect (a) to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to the other party or (b) to seek an Award for
specific performance in accordance with _Section 5.1_ within sixty (60) days
after the scheduled Closing Date. If an Award for specific performance is
issued to either party, the party receiving such Award shall be permitted to
enforce such Award in any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the
Travel Centers and the party against whom such Award is issued waives and
covenants not to assert any objection against the recipient partys right to
enforce such Award.

 



 

 **SECTION 5 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

5.1 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) Any disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any disputes,
claims or controversies brought by or on behalf of the HPT Parties, the TA
Parties, RMR or any holder of equity interests (which, for purposes of this
_Section 5.1_, shall mean any holder of record or any beneficial owner of
equity interests or any former holder of record or beneficial owner of equity
interests) of the HPT Parties, the TA Parties or RMR, either on his, her or
its own behalf, on behalf of the HPT Parties, the TA Parties, RMR or on behalf
of any series or class of equity interests of the HPT Parties, the TA Parties,
RMR or holders of any equity interests of the HPT Parties, the TA Parties, RMR
against the HPT Parties, the TA Parties, RMR or any of their respective
trustees, directors, members, officers, managers (including The RMR Group Inc.
or its successor), agents or employees, including any disputes, claims or
controversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity,
performance, application or enforcement of this Agreement, including this
arbitration agreement or the governing documents of the HPT Parties, the TA
Parties or RMR (all of which are referred to as " _Disputes_ "), or relating
in any way to such a Dispute or Disputes shall, on the demand of any party to
such Dispute or Disputes, be resolved through binding and final arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ ") of the
American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") then in effect, except as those
Rules may be modified in this _Section 5.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, and
not as a limitation, Disputes are intended to include derivative actions
against the trustees, directors, officers or managers of the HPT Parties, the
TA Parties, RMR and class actions by a holder of equity interests against
those individuals or entities and the HPT Parties, the TA Parties and RMR. For
the avoidance of doubt, a Dispute shall include a Dispute made derivatively on
behalf of one party against another party. For purposes of this _Section
5.1_, the term "equity interest" shall mean, (i) in respect of the HPT
Parties, shares of beneficial interest of HPT, (ii) in respect of the TA
Parties, "membership interests" in TA LLC as defined in the Delaware Limited
Liability Companies Act, (iii) in respect of RMR, "membership interests" in
RMR as defined in the Delaware Limited Liability Companies Act.

 



 

(b) There shall be three (3) arbitrators. If there are only two (2) parties to
the Dispute, each party shall select one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15)
days after receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. The
arbitrators may be affiliated or interested persons of the parties. If there
are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all

 



     

 

 



 

claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other hand, shall each
select, by the vote of a majority of the claimants or the respondents, as the
case may be, one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the
demand for arbitration. The arbitrators may be affiliated or interested
persons of the claimants or the respondents, as the case may be. If either a
claimant (or all claimants) or a respondent (or all respondents) fail(s) to
timely select an arbitrator then the party (or parties) who has selected an
arbitrator may request AAA to provide a list of three (3) proposed arbitrators
in accordance with the Rules (each of whom shall be neutral, impartial and
unaffiliated with any party) and the party (or parties) that failed to timely
appoint an arbitrator shall have ten (10) days from the date AAA provides the
list to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators proposed by AAA. If the
party (or parties) fail(s) to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by that time,
the party (or parties) who have appointed the first (1st) arbitrator shall
then have ten (10) days to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators
proposed by AAA to be the second (2nd) arbitrator; and, if it/they should fail
to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by such time, AAA shall select, within
fifteen (15) days thereafter, one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators it had
proposed as the second (2nd) arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators so appointed
shall jointly appoint the third (3rd) and presiding arbitrator (who shall be
neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) within fifteen (15) days
of the appointment of the second (2nd) arbitrator. If the third (3rd)
arbitrator has not been appointed within the time limit specified herein, then
AAA shall provide a list of proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules,
and the arbitrator shall be appointed by AAA in accordance with a listing,
striking and ranking procedure, with each party having a limited number of
strikes, excluding strikes for cause.

 



 

(c) The place of arbitration shall be Boston, Massachusetts unless otherwise
agreed by the parties.

 



 

(d) There shall be only limited documentary discovery of documents directly
related to the issues in dispute, as may be ordered by the arbitrators. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that there shall be no depositions and
no other discovery other than limited documentary discovery as described in
the preceding sentence.

 



 

(e) In rendering an award or decision (an " _Award_ "), the arbitrators shall
be required to follow the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to
principles of conflicts of law. Any arbitration proceedings or Award and the
validity, effect and interpretation of this arbitration agreement shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. An Award shall be
in writing and shall state the findings of fact and conclusions of law on
which it is based. Any monetary Award shall be made and payable in U.S.
dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset. Subject to _Section 5.1(g)_,
each party against which an Award assesses a monetary obligation shall pay
that obligation on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of
such Award or such other date as such Award may provide.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent expressly provided by this Agreement or as otherwise
agreed by the parties, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, each
party involved in a Dispute shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees), and the arbitrators shall not render an Award that would
include shifting of any such costs or expenses (including attorneys fees) or,
in a derivative case or class action, award any portion of the HPT Parties,
the TA Parties or RMR, as applicable, Award to the claimant or the claimants
attorneys. Each party (or, if there are more than two (2) parties to the
Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all

 



     

 

 



 

respondents, on the other hand, respectively) shall bear the costs and
expenses of its (or their) selected arbitrator and the parties (or, if there
are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand,
and all respondents, on the other hand) shall equally bear the costs and
expenses of the third (3rd) appointed arbitrator.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this Agreement, any Award,
including but not limited to, any interim Award, may be appealed pursuant to
the AAAs Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (" _Appellate Rules_ "). An
Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice
of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be
initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Award by filing a notice of
appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process, the decision
rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, and despite any contrary
provision of the Appellate Rules, _Section 5.1(f)_ hereof shall apply to any
appeal pursuant to this Section and the appeal tribunal shall not render an
Award that would include shifting of any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees) of any party.

 



 

(h) Following the expiration of the time for filing the notice of appeal, or
the conclusion of the appeal process set forth in _Section 5.1(g)_, an Award
shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto and shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy between those parties relating to the Dispute, including any
claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to the arbitrators.
Judgment upon an Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, no application or appeal to any court of
competent jurisdiction may be made in connection with any question of law
arising in the course of arbitration or with respect to any Award made except
for actions relating to enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate or any
arbitral award issued hereunder and except for actions seeking interim or
other provisional relief in aid of arbitration proceedings in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(i) This _Section 5.1_ is intended to benefit and be enforceable by the HPT
Parties, the TA Parties, RMR and their respective holders of equity interests,
trustees, directors, officers, managers (including The RMR Group Inc. or its
successor), agents or employees, and their respective successors and assigns
and shall be binding upon the HPT Parties, the TA Parties, RMR and their
respective holders of equity interests, and be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
such individuals or entities may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

5.2 _Confidentiality_. Each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the confidentiality of any information concerning the
other party or any subsidiary of the other party provided to or discovered by
it or its representatives and which is not otherwise available on a
nonconfidential basis to such party and shall not (except as may otherwise be
required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange
applicable to any of the parties hereto) disclose such information, subject to
the provisions of this Section, to anyone other than those people who have a
need to know such information in connection with the conduct of such partys
business, including its attorneys, accountants and other representatives and
agents or during the course of or in connection with any litigation or other
action, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding based upon or in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement.

rights hereunder shall release the other parties from full performance of
their remaining obligations stated herein. No failure to exercise or delay in

modification, consent or discharge be effected, except by an instrument in
writing executed by or

subsidiary of any TA Party or it may designate any wholly-owned subsidiary of

hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
is not intended and shall not be construed to create any rights in or to be
enforceable in any part by any other Person.

 



 

5.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed
to be, or shall in fact be, invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied
to any particular case in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions, or in all
jurisdictions or in all cases, because of the conflict of any provision with
any constitution or statute or rule of public policy or for any other reason,
such circumstance shall not have the effect of rendering the provision or
provisions in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other
jurisdiction or in any other case or circumstance or of rendering any other
provision or provisions herein contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable
to the extent that such other provisions are not themselves actually in
conflict with such constitution, statute or rule of public policy, but this
Agreement shall be reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction or case as
if such invalid, inoperative or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein and such provision reformed so that it would be valid,
operative and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted in such jurisdiction
or in such case.

 



 

5.7 _Counterparts, Etc_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which

the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or modified in
any respect other than by the written agreement of all of the parties hereto.

 **AMENDMENT TO TA LEASE NO. 1**

 



 

(See attached copy.)

      

 

 



 

 ** _SECOND AMENDMENT TO 
AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASE AGREEMENT NO. 1_**

 



 

 **THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASE AGREEMENT NO. 1** (this
" _Amendment_ ") is made and entered into as of January 17, 2019, by and
between **HPT TA PROPERTIES TRUST** , a Maryland real estate investment trust,
and **HPT TA PROPERTIES LLC** , a Maryland limited liability company, as
landlord (collectively, " _Landlord_ "), and **TA OPERATING LLC** , a Delaware
limited liability company, as tenant (" _Tenant_ ").

 



 

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 1, dated as of June 9, 2015, as amended by that
certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 1, dated
as of June 22, 2016 (as so amended, the " _Lease_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord is selling to Tenant, and Tenant is acquiring from
Landlord, the Properties (this and other capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings given such terms
in the Lease) related to the Travel Centers identified on _Schedule 1_
attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the " _Removed
Properties_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Landlord and Tenant wish to add certain land and improvements
comprising a travel center having an address at 8050 Dean Martin Drive, Las
Vegas, Nevada 89139 and further described on _Exhibit A-41_ attached to this
Amendment (collectively, the " _Las Vegas Property_ ") to the Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in addition to amending the Lease to remove the Removed
Properties from the Lease and to add the Las Vegas Property to the Lease,
Landlord and Tenant wish to amend the Lease in certain other respects; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Guarantor is executing this Amendment solely to confirm the
continuation of the Guaranty with respect to the Lease (as amended by this
Amendment);

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree, as of the date of this Amendment, as follows:

 



 

1. _Removed Properties_. The Leased Property shall exclude the Removed Properties, but notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall retain all of its obligations with respect to the Removed Properties which are attributable to events occurring on or prior to the date hereof or which are addressed pursuant to _Section 9.5_ of the Lease (as if all of the Removed Properties remained Properties for the remainder of the Term). In furtherance of the foregoing, however, Tenant shall have no obligation to comply with _Section 5.3_ of the Lease solely with respect to the Removed Properties.

     

 

 



 

2. _Base Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Base Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.9_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

3. _Base Year_. The defined term "Base Year" set forth in _Section 1.10_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 **" _Base Year_ " **shall mean, with respect to each Property, the calendar
year identified as the Initial Base Year on _Exhibit A_ for such Property
(the " **Initial Base Year** ") and/or the 2019 calendar year (the " **2019
Base Year** "), as applicable.

 



 

4. _Commencement Date_. The defined term "Commencement Date" set forth in _Section 1.18_ of the Lease shall mean, with respect to the Las Vegas Property, the date of this Amendment.

 



 

5. _Excess Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Excess Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.34_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

6. _Minimum Rent_. The defined term "Minimum Rent" set forth in _Section 1.66_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

" ** _Minimum Rent_** " shall mean Fifty-Two Million Two Hundred Ninety-One
Thousand Six Hundred Eleven and 00/100ths Dollars ($52,291,611.00), subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 3.1.1(b)_.

 



 

7. _Fixed Term_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is amended to delete the first sentence
therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

The initial term of this Agreement (the " **Fixed Term** ") shall commence on
the Commencement Date and shall expire on December 31, 2032.

 



 

(b) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is also amended to delete the parenthetical
"(but not later than December 31, 2027)" from the first sentence of the second
paragraph thereof.

 



 

8. _Extended Terms_. _Section 2.4_ of the Lease is amended to delete the second paragraph therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

If and to the extent Tenant shall exercise the foregoing options to extend the
Term, the first Extended Term shall commence on January 1, 2033 and expire on
December 31, 2047 and the second Extended Term shall commence on January 1,
January 1, 2048 and expire on December 31, 2062. All of the terms, covenants
and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each Extended Term, except
that

 



     

 

 



 

(x) the Minimum Rent payable during such Extended Term shall be the greater of
the Prior Rent and the Fair Market Value Rent for the Leased Property (such
Fair Market Value Rent to be determined by agreement of the parties or, absent
agreement, by an appraiser designated by Landlord) (taking into account that
the Initial Base Year and the 2019 Base Year, as applicable, shall remain
unchanged) and (y) Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term beyond
December 31, 2062. For purposes of this Section 2.4, "Prior Rent" shall mean
an amount equal to the per annum Minimum Rent in effect on the last day of the
Fixed Term or Extended Term immediately preceding such Extended Term. If
Tenant shall elect to exercise the option to extend the Term for the first
Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice thereof not later than
December 31, 2031, and if Tenant shall elect to exercise its option to extend
the Term for the second Extended Term after having elected to extend the Term
for the first Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice not
later than December 31, 2046, it being understood and agreed that time shall
be of the essence with respect to the giving of any such Notice. If Tenant
shall fail to give any such Notice, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term as
applicable and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this
Agreement. If Tenant shall give such Notice, the extension of this Agreement
shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional
documents; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant and Landlord
shall execute such documents and agreements as either party shall reasonably
require to evidence the same. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, if, subsequent to the giving of such Notice, an Event of Default
shall occur, at Landlords option, the extension of this Agreement shall cease
to take effect and this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of
the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term, as applicable, and Tenant shall
have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Additional Rent_. _Section 3.1.2(a)_ of the Lease is amended by deleting the first sentence therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

 



 

Tenant shall pay additional rent (" _Additional Rent_ ") with respect to each
Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term subsequent to the Initial Base
Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to three percent (3%)
of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during such Lease Year
exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the Initial Base Year (or the
equivalent portion thereof). In addition, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent
with respect to each Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term
subsequent to the 2019 Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount
equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such
Property during such Lease Year exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during
the 2019 Base Year (or the equivalent portion thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, the payment of Additional Rent based on Gross Revenues in excess of
Gross Revenues for the Initial Base Year and the payment of Additional Rent
based on Gross Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues for the 2019 Base Year are
separate and independent obligations.

 



     

 

 



 

10. _Deferred Rent_. _Section 3.1.3(f)_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 ** _Deferred Rent_** **. **Commencing on April 1, 2019 through January 31,
2023, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, the total amount of Fourteen Million One
Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Nine and 00/100ths Dollars
($14,175,239.00) in sixteen (16) equal quarterly installments of Eight Hundred
Eighty-Five Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty-Two and 00/100ths Dollars
($885,952.00) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter during such
period.

 



 

8. _Exhibit A_. _Exhibit A_ to the Lease is hereby amended by (a) deleting the initial page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-40" therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-41" attached hereto, (b) deleting the legal descriptions for the Removed Properties from _Exhibits A-14, A-19 and A-38_ to the Lease and replacing them with "Intentionally deleted", and (c) adding _Exhibit A-41_ attached to this Amendment to the end of _Exhibit A_ to the Lease.

 



 

9. _Ratification_. As amended hereby, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and effect.

 



 

10. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

 



     

 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , Landlord and Tenant have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed, as a sealed instrument, as of the date first above written.

 ** _SEVENTH AMENDMENT TO

 **THIS SEVENTH AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASE AGREEMENT NO. 2**
(this " _Amendment_ ") is made and entered into as of January 17, 2019, by and
between **HPT TA PROPERTIES TRUST** , a Maryland real estate investment trust,
and **HPT TA PROPERTIES LLC** , a Maryland limited liability company, as
landlord (collectively, " _Landlord_ "), and **TA OPERATING LLC** , a Delaware
limited liability company, as tenant (" _Tenant_ ").

 



 

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 2, dated as of June 9, 2015, as amended by that
certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 2, dated
as of June 16, 2015, that certain Second Amendment to Amended and Restated
Lease Agreement No. 2, dated as of June 23, 2015, that certain Third Amendment
to Amended and Restated Lease No. 2, dated as of September 23, 2015, that
certain Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease No. 2, dated as of June
22, 2016, that certain Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease No. 2,
dated as of June 30, 2016, and that certain Sixth Amendment to Amended and
Restated Lease No. 2, dated as of September 30, 2016 (as so amended, the "
_Lease_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , HPT TA Properties Trust is selling to Tenant, and Tenant is
acquiring from HPT TA Properties Trust, the Properties (this and other
capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have
the meanings given such terms in the Lease) related to the Travel Centers
identified on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and made a part hereof
(collectively, the " _Sold Properties_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant desire to remove the Property having an
address at 8050 Dean Martin Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89139 and further
described on _Exhibit A-21_ to the Lease (together with the Sold Properties,
collectively, the " _Removed Properties_ ") from the Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant wish to add certain land and improvements
comprising a travel center having an address at 10346 S. State Rd. 39,
Clayton, Indiana and further described on _Exhibit A-41_ attached to this
Amendment (collectively, the " _Clayton Property_ ") to the Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in addition to amending the Lease to remove the Removed
Properties from the Lease and to add the Clayton Property to the Lease,
Landlord and Tenant wish to amend the Lease in certain other respects; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Guarantor is executing this Amendment solely to confirm the
continuation of the Guaranty with respect to the Lease (as amended by this
Amendment);

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are

     

 

 



 

hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree, as of the date of this
Amendment, as follows:

 



 

1. _Removed Properties_. The Leased Property shall exclude the Removed Properties, but notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall retain all of its obligations with respect to the Removed Properties which are attributable to events occurring on or prior to the date hereof or which are addressed pursuant to _Section 9.5_ of the Lease (as if all of the Removed Properties remained Properties for the remainder of the Term). In furtherance of the foregoing, however, Tenant shall have no obligation to comply with _Section 5.3_ of the Lease solely with respect to the Removed Properties.

 



 

2. _Base Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Base Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.9_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

3. _Base Year_. The defined term "Base Year" set forth in _Section 1.10_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 **" _Base Year_ " **shall mean, with respect to each Property, the calendar
year identified as the Initial Base Year on _Exhibit A_ for such Property
(the " **Initial Base Year** ") and/or the 2019 calendar year (the " **2019
Base Year** "), as applicable.

 



 

4. _Commencement Date_. The defined term "Commencement Date" set forth in _Section 1.18_ of the Lease shall mean, with respect to the Clayton Property, the date of this Amendment.

 



 

5. _Excess Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Excess Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.34_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

6. _Minimum Rent_. The defined term "Minimum Rent" set forth in Section 1.66 of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

" ** _Minimum Rent_** " shall mean Forty-Seven Million Two Hundred Forty-Seven
Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven and 00/100ths Dollars ($47,247,667.00),
subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 3.1.1(b)_.

 



 

7. _Fixed Term_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is amended to delete the first sentence
therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

The initial term of this Agreement (the " **Fixed Term** ") shall commence on
the Commencement Date and shall expire on December 31, 2031.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is also amended to delete the parenthetical
"(but not later than December 31, 2027)" from the first sentence of the second
paragraph thereof.

 



 

8. _Extended Terms_. _Section 2.4_ of the Lease is amended to delete the second paragraph therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

If and to the extent Tenant shall exercise the foregoing options to extend the
Term, the first Extended Term shall commence on January 1, 2032 and expire on
December 31, 2046 and the second Extended Term shall commence on January 1,
January 1, 2047 and expire on December 31, 2061. All of the terms, covenants
and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each Extended Term, except
that (x) the Minimum Rent payable during such Extended Term shall be the
greater of the Prior Rent and the Fair Market Value Rent for the Leased
Property (such Fair Market Value Rent to be determined by agreement of the
parties or, absent agreement, by an appraiser designated by Landlord) (taking
into account that the Initial Base Year and the 2019 Base Year, as applicable,
shall remain unchanged) and (y) Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term
beyond December 31, 2061. For purposes of this Section 2.4, "Prior Rent" shall
mean an amount equal to the per annum Minimum Rent in effect on the last day
of the Fixed Term or Extended Term immediately preceding such Extended Term.
If Tenant shall elect to exercise the option to extend the Term for the first
Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice thereof not later than
December 31, 2030, and if Tenant shall elect to exercise its option to extend
the Term for the second Extended Term after having elected to extend the Term
for the first Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice not
later than December 31, 2045, it being understood and agreed that time shall
be of the essence with respect to the giving of any such Notice. If Tenant
shall fail to give any such Notice, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term as
applicable and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this
Agreement. If Tenant shall give such Notice, the extension of this Agreement
shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional
documents; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant and Landlord
shall execute such documents and agreements as either party shall reasonably
require to evidence the same. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, if, subsequent to the giving of such Notice, an Event of Default
shall occur, at Landlords option, the extension of this Agreement shall cease
to take effect and this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of
the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term, as applicable, and Tenant shall
have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Additional Rent_. _Section 3.1.2(a)_ of the Lease is amended by deleting the first sentence therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

 



 

Tenant shall pay additional rent (" _Additional Rent_ ") with respect to each
Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term subsequent to the Initial Base
Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to three percent (3%)
of the

 



     

 

 



 

amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during such Lease Year exceed
Gross Revenues at such Property during the Initial Base Year (or the
equivalent portion thereof). In addition, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent
with respect to each Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term
subsequent to the 2019 Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount
equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such
Property during such Lease Year exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during
the 2019 Base Year (or the equivalent portion thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, the payment of Additional Rent based on Gross Revenues in excess of
Gross Revenues for the Initial Base Year and the payment of Additional Rent
based on Gross Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues for the 2019 Base Year are
separate and independent obligations.

 



 

10. _Deferred Rent_. _Section 3.1.3(f)_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 ** _Deferred Rent_** **. **Commencing on April 1, 2019 through January 31,
2023, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, the total amount of Twelve Million Eight
Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-Two and 00/100ths Dollars
($12,846,692.00) in sixteen (16) equal quarterly installments of Eight Hundred
Two Thousand Nine Hundred Eighteen and 00/100ths Dollars ($802,918.00) on the
first Business Day of each calendar quarter during such period.

 



 

11. _Exhibit A_. Exhibit A to the Lease is hereby amended by (a) deleting the initial page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-40" therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-41" attached hereto, (b) deleting the legal descriptions for the Removed Properties from _Exhibits A-21_ , _A-24_ and _A-35_ to the Lease and replacing them with "Intentionally deleted", and (c) adding Exhibit _A-41_ attached to this Amendment to the end of Exhibit A to the Lease.

 



 

12. _Ratification_. As amended hereby, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and effect.

 



 

13. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

 



     

 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , Landlord and Tenant have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed, as a sealed instrument, as of the date first above written.

 **AMENDMENT TO TA LEASE NO. 3**

 



 

(See attached copy.)

      

 

 



 

 ** _THIRD AMENDMENT TO 
AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASE AGREEMENT NO. 3_**

 



 

 **THIS THIRD AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED LEASE AGREEMENT NO. 3** (this
" _Amendment_ ") is made and entered into as of January 17, 2019, by and
between **HPT TA PROPERTIES TRUST** , a Maryland real estate investment trust,
and **HPT TA PROPERTIES LLC** , a Maryland limited liability company, as
landlord (collectively, " _Landlord_ "), and **TA OPERATING LLC** , a Delaware
limited liability company, as tenant (" _Tenant_ ").

 



 

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 3, dated as of June 9, 2015, as amended by that
certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 3, dated
as of September 23, 2015, and that certain Second Amendment to Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 3, dated as of June 22, 2016 (as so amended, the
" _Lease_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord is selling to Tenant, and Tenant is acquiring from
Landlord, the Properties (this and other capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined in this Amendment shall have the meanings given such terms
in the Lease) related to the Travel Centers identified on _Schedule 1(a)_
attached hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the " _Sold Properties_
");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant wish to remove the Properties related to
the Travel Centers identified on _Schedule 1(b)_ attached hereto and made a
part hereof (collectively, the " _Reallocated Properties_ " and, together with
the Sold Properties, collectively the " _Removed Properties_ ") from the
Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant wish to add certain land and improvements
comprising the travel centers identified on _Schedule 2_ attached hereto and
made a part hereof (collectively, the " _Additional Properties_ ") to the
Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in addition to amending the Lease to remove the Removed
Properties from the Lease and to add the Additional Properties to the Lease,
Landlord and Tenant wish to amend the Lease in certain other respects; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Guarantor is executing this Amendment solely to confirm the
continuation of the Guaranty with respect to the Lease (as amended by this
Amendment);

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree, as of the date of this Amendment, as follows:

 



 

1. _Removed Properties_. The Leased Property shall exclude the Removed Properties, but notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall retain all of its obligations with respect to the Removed Properties which are attributable to events occurring on or prior to the date hereof or which are addressed pursuant to _Section 9.5_ of the Lease (as if all of the Removed Properties

     

 

 



 

remained Properties for the remainder of the Term). In furtherance of the
foregoing, however, Tenant shall have no obligation to comply with _Section
5.3_ of the Lease solely with respect to the Removed Properties.

 



 

2. _Base Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Base Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.9_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

3. _Base Year_. The defined term "Base Year" set forth in _Section 1.10_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 **" _Base Year_ " **shall mean, with respect to each Property, the calendar
year identified as the Initial Base Year on _Exhibit A_ for such Property
(the " **Initial Base Year** ") and/or the 2019 calendar year (the " **2019
Base Year** "), as applicable.

 



 

4. _Commencement Date_. The defined term "Commencement Date" set forth in _Section 1.18_ of the Lease shall mean, with respect to the Additional Properties, the date of this Amendment.

 



 

5. _Excess Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Excess Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.34_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

6. _Minimum Rent_. The defined term "Minimum Rent" set forth in Section 1.66 of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

" ** _Minimum Rent_** " shall mean Forty-Four Million Four Hundred Eleven
Thousand Six Hundred Eighteen and 00/100ths Dollars ($44,411,618.00), subject
to adjustment as provided in _Section 3.1.1(b)_.

 



 

7. _Fixed Term_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is amended to delete the first sentence
therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

The initial term of this Agreement (the " **Fixed Term** ") shall commence on
the Commencement Date and shall expire on December 31, 2029.

 



 

(b) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is also amended to delete the parenthetical
"(but not later than December 31, 2027)" from the first sentence of the second
paragraph thereof.

 



     

 

 



 

8. _Extended Terms_. _Section 2.4_ of the Lease is amended to delete the second paragraph therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

If and to the extent Tenant shall exercise the foregoing options to extend the
Term, the first Extended Term shall commence on January 1, 2030 and expire on
December 31, 2044 and the second Extended Term shall commence on January 1,
January 1, 2045 and expire on December 31, 2059. All of the terms, covenants
and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each Extended Term, except
that (x) the Minimum Rent payable during such Extended Term shall be the
greater of the Prior Rent and the Fair Market Value Rent for the Leased
Property (such Fair Market Value Rent to be determined by agreement of the
parties or, absent agreement, by an appraiser designated by Landlord) (taking
into account that the Initial Base Year and the 2019 Base Year, as applicable,
shall remain unchanged) and (y) Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term
beyond December 31, 2059. For purposes of this Section 2.4, "Prior Rent" shall
mean an amount equal to the per annum Minimum Rent in effect on the last day
of the Fixed Term or Extended Term immediately preceding such Extended Term.
If Tenant shall elect to exercise the option to extend the Term for the first
Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice thereof not later than
December 31, 2028, and if Tenant shall elect to exercise its option to extend
the Term for the second Extended Term after having elected to extend the Term
for the first Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice not
later than December 31, 2043, it being understood and agreed that time shall
be of the essence with respect to the giving of any such Notice. If Tenant
shall fail to give any such Notice, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term as
applicable and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this
Agreement. If Tenant shall give such Notice, the extension of this Agreement
shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional
documents; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant and Landlord
shall execute such documents and agreements as either party shall reasonably
require to evidence the same. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, if, subsequent to the giving of such Notice, an Event of Default
shall occur, at Landlords option, the extension of this Agreement shall cease
to take effect and this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of
the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term, as applicable, and Tenant shall
have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Additional Rent_. _Section 3.1.2(a)_ of the Lease is amended by deleting the first sentence therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

 



 

Tenant shall pay additional rent (" _Additional Rent_ ") with respect to each
Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term subsequent to the Initial Base
Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to three percent (3%)
of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during such Lease Year
exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the Initial Base Year (or the
equivalent portion thereof). In addition, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent
with respect to each Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term
subsequent to the

 



     

 

 



 

2019 Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to one-half
percent (0.5%) of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during
such Lease Year exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the 2019 Base
Year (or the equivalent portion thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the
payment of Additional Rent based on Gross Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues
for the Initial Base Year and the payment of Additional Rent based on Gross
Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues for the 2019 Base Year are separate and
independent obligations.

 



 

10. _Deferred Rent_. _Section 3.1.3(f)_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 ** _Deferred Rent_** **. **Commencing on April 1, 2019 through January 31,
2023, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, the total amount of Twelve Million Six
Hundred Three Thousand Eighty-Five and 00/100ths Dollars ($12,603,085.00) in
sixteen (16) equal quarterly installments of Seven Hundred Eighty-Seven
Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-Three and 00/100ths Dollars ($787,693.00) on the
first Business Day of each calendar quarter during such period.

 



 

11. _Exhibit A_. _Exhibit A_ to the Lease is hereby amended by (a) deleting the initial page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-39" therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-42" attached hereto, (b) deleting the legal descriptions for the Removed Properties from _Exhibits A-2_ , _A-3_ , _A-9_ , _A-12_ , _A-17_ , _A-21_ to the Lease and replacing them with "Intentionally deleted" and (c) (d) adding _Exhibits A-40_ , _A-41_ and _A-42_ attached to this Amendment to the end of _Exhibit A_ to the Lease.

 



 

12. _Ratification_. As amended hereby, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and effect.

 



 

13. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

 



     

 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , Landlord and Tenant have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed, as a sealed instrument, as of the date first above written.

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of June 9, 2015, as amended by that
certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated
as of June 16, 2015, that certain Second Amendment to Amended and Restated
Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of June 23, 2015, that certain Third Amendment
to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of September 23, 2015,
that certain Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 4,
dated as of March 31, 2016, that certain Fifth Amendment to Amended and
Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of June 22, 2016, that certain Sixth
Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of September
14, 2016, that certain Seventh Amendment to Amended and Restated Lease
Agreement No. 4, dated as of May 3, 2017, and that certain Eighth Amendment to
Amended and Restated Lease Agreement No. 4, dated as of September 28\. 2017
(as so amended, the " _Lease_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant wish to remove the Properties (this and
other capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Amendment shall
have the meanings given such terms in the Lease) related to the Travel Centers
identified on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto and made a part hereof
(collectively, the " _Removed Properties_ ") from the Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant wish to add certain land and improvements
comprising the travel centers identified on described on _Schedule 2_ attached
hereto and made a part hereof (collectively, the " _Additional Properties_ ")
to the Lease;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , in addition to amending the Lease to remove the Removed
Properties from the Lease and to add the Additional Properties to the Lease,
Landlord and Tenant wish to amend the Lease in certain other respects; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Guarantor is executing this Amendment solely to confirm the
continuation of the Guaranty with respect to the Lease (as amended by this
Amendment);

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree, as of the date of this Amendment, as follows:

 



 

1. _Removed Properties_. The Leased Property shall exclude the Removed Properties, but notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall retain all of its obligations with respect to the

     

 

 



 

Removed Properties which are attributable to events occurring on or prior to
the date hereof or which are addressed pursuant to _Section 9.5_ of the Lease
(as if all of the Removed Properties remained Properties for the remainder of
the Term). In furtherance of the foregoing, however, Tenant shall have no
obligation to comply with _Section 5.3_ of the Lease solely with respect to
the Removed Properties.

 



 

2. _Base Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Base Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.9_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

3. _Base Year_. The defined term "Base Year" set forth in _Section 1.10_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 **" _Base Year_ " **shall mean, with respect to each Property, the calendar
year identified as the Initial Base Year on _Exhibit A_ for such Property
(the " **Initial Base Year** ") and/or the 2019 calendar year (the " **2019
Base Year** "), as applicable.

 



 

4. _Commencement Date_. The defined term "Commencement Date" set forth in _Section 1.18_ of the Lease shall mean, with respect to the Additional Properties, the date of this Amendment.

 



 

5. _Excess Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Excess Gross Revenues" set forth in _Section 1.34_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

6. _Minimum Rent_. The defined term "Minimum Rent" set forth in Section 1.66 of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

" ** _Minimum Rent_** " shall mean Fifty Million Thirty-Three Thousand Nine
Hundred Seventy-Six and 00/100ths Dollars ($50,033,976.00), subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 3.1.1(b)_.

 



 

7. _Fixed Term_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is amended to delete the first sentence
therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

The initial term of this Agreement (the " **Fixed Term** ") shall commence on
the Commencement Date and shall expire on December 31, 2033.

 



 

(b) _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is also amended to delete the parenthetical
"(but not later than December 31, 2027)" from the first sentence of the second
paragraph thereof.

 



     

 

 



 

8. _Extended Terms_. _Section 2.4_ of the Lease is amended to delete the second paragraph therefrom in its entirety and to replace it with the following:

 



 

If and to the extent Tenant shall exercise the foregoing options to extend the
Term, the first Extended Term shall commence on January 1, 2034 and expire on
December 31, 2048 and the second Extended Term shall commence on January 1,
January 1, 2049 and expire on December 31, 2063. All of the terms, covenants
and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each Extended Term, except
that (x) the Minimum Rent payable during such Extended Term shall be the
greater of the Prior Rent and the Fair Market Value Rent for the Leased
Property (such Fair Market Value Rent to be determined by agreement of the
parties or, absent agreement, by an appraiser designated by Landlord) (taking
into account that the Initial Base Year and the 2019 Base Year, as applicable,
shall remain unchanged) and (y) Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term
beyond December 31, 2063. For purposes of this Section 2.4, "Prior Rent" shall
mean an amount equal to the per annum Minimum Rent in effect on the last day
of the Fixed Term or Extended Term immediately preceding such Extended Term.
If Tenant shall elect to exercise the option to extend the Term for the first
Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice thereof not later than
December 31, 2032, and if Tenant shall elect to exercise its option to extend
the Term for the second Extended Term after having elected to extend the Term
for the first Extended Term, it shall do so by giving Landlord Notice not
later than December 31, 2047, it being understood and agreed that time shall
be of the essence with respect to the giving of any such Notice. If Tenant
shall fail to give any such Notice, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate at the end of the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term as
applicable and Tenant shall have no further option to extend the Term of this
Agreement. If Tenant shall give such Notice, the extension of this Agreement
shall be automatically effected without the execution of any additional
documents; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant and Landlord
shall execute such documents and agreements as either party shall reasonably
require to evidence the same. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
sentence, if, subsequent to the giving of such Notice, an Event of Default
shall occur, at Landlords option, the extension of this Agreement shall cease
to take effect and this Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of
the Fixed Term or the first Extended Term, as applicable, and Tenant shall
have no further option to extend the Term of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Additional Rent_. _Section 3.1.2(a)_ of the Lease is amended by deleting the first sentence therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

 



 

Tenant shall pay additional rent (" _Additional Rent_ ") with respect to each
Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term subsequent to the Initial Base
Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to three percent (3%)
of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during such Lease Year
exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the Initial Base Year (or the
equivalent portion thereof). In addition, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent
with respect to each Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term
subsequent to the

 



     

 

 



 

2019 Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to one-half
percent (0.5%) of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during
such Lease Year exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the 2019 Base
Year (or the equivalent portion thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the
payment of Additional Rent based on Gross Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues
for the Initial Base Year and the payment of Additional Rent based on Gross
Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues for the 2019 Base Year are separate and
independent obligations.

 



 

10. _Deferred Rent_. _Section 3.1.3(f)_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 ** _Deferred Rent_** **. **Commencing on April 1, 2019 through January 31,
2023, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, the total amount of Twelve Million Nine
Hundred Sixty Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty-Seven and 00/100ths Dollars
($12,960,867.00) in sixteen (16) equal quarterly installments of Eight Hundred
Ten Thousand Fifty-Four and 00/100ths Dollars ($810,054.00) on the first
Business Day of each calendar quarter during such period.

 



 

11. _Exhibit A_. _Exhibit A_ to the Lease is hereby amended by (a) deleting the initial page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-40" therefrom in its entirety and replacing it with the page entitled "EXHIBITS A-1 through A-42" attached hereto, (b) deleting the legal descriptions for the Removed Properties from _Exhibits A-10_ , _A-23_ , _A-39_ and _A-40_ to the Lease and replacing them with "Intentionally deleted", and (c) adding _Exhibits A-41_ and _A-42_ attached to this Amendment to the end of _Exhibit A_ to the Lease.

 



 

12. _Ratification_. As amended hereby, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and effect.

 



 

13. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

 



     

 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , Landlord and Tenant have caused this Amendment to be
duly executed, as a sealed instrument, as of the date first above written.

 ** _AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT_**

 



 

 **THIS AMENDMENT TO LEASE AGREEMENT** (this " _Amendment_ ") is entered into
as of January 17, 2019, by and among **HPT PSC PROPERTIES TRUST** , a Maryland
real estate investment trust, and **HPT PSC PROPERTIES LLC** , a Maryland
limited liability company (collectively, " _Landlord_ "), and **TA OPERATING
LLC** , a Delaware limited liability company (" _Tenant_ ").

 



 

 ** _W_** **_I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :**

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Landlord and Tenant (as successor by merger with Petro Stopping
Centers, L.P.) are parties to that certain Lease Agreement, dated as of May
30, 2007, as amended (as so amended, the " _Lease_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the Lease in certain
respects; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Guarantor is executing this Amendment to confirm the
continuation of the Guaranty;

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained and other good and valuable consideration, the mutual receipt and
legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree, as of the date of this Amendment, as follows:

 



 

1. _Base Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Base Gross Revenues" set forth in _Article 1_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

2. _Base Year_. The defined term "Base Year" set forth in _Article 1_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

 **" _Base Year_ " **shall mean, with respect to each Property, the 2012
calendar year (the " **2012 Base Year** ") and/or the 2019 calendar year (the
" **2019 Base Year** "), as applicable.

 



 

3. _Excess Gross Revenues_. The defined term "Excess Gross Revenues" set forth in _Article 1_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: "Intentionally deleted."

 



 

4. _Minimum Rent_. The defined term "Minimum Rent" set forth in _Article 1_ of the Lease is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

" ** _Minimum Rent_** " shall mean Seventy-Three Million Four Hundred Thousand
Three Hundred Eighty-Eight and 00/100ths Dollars ($73,400,388.00), subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 3.1.1(b)_.

     

 

 



 

5. _Fixed Term_. _Section 2.3_ of the Lease is deleted therefrom in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

The initial term of this Agreement (the " **Fixed Term** ") shall commence on
the Commencement Date and shall expire on June 30, 2035.

 



 

6. _Additional Rent_. _Section 3.1.2(a)_ of the Lease is deleted therefrom in its entirety and replaced with the following:

 



 

Tenant shall pay additional rent (" _Additional Rent_ ") with respect to each
Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term subsequent to the 2012 Base
Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount equal to three percent (3%)
of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such Property during such Lease Year
exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during the 2012 Base Year (or the
equivalent portion thereof). In addition, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent
with respect to each Lease Year (or portion thereof) during the Term
subsequent to the 2019 Base Year, with respect to each Property, in an amount
equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the amount by which Gross Revenues at such
Property during such Lease Year exceed Gross Revenues at such Property during
the 2019 Base Year (or the equivalent portion thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, the payment of Additional Rent based on Gross Revenues in excess of
Gross Revenues for the 2012 Base Year and the payment of Additional Rent based
on Gross Revenues in excess of Gross Revenues for the 2019 Base Year are
separate and independent obligations.

2023, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, the total amount of Seventeen Million

Million One Hundred Seventeen Thousand Twenty-Six and 00/100ths Dollars
($1,117,026.00) on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter during such
period.

 



 

8. _Ratification_. As amended hereby, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed and remains in full force and effect.

 



 

9. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 ** _CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS_**

 



 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provides that a
transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the
transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. federal income tax purposes
(including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal
title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor
of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform the transferee that
withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real
property interest by HOSPITALITY PROPERTIES TRUST, a Maryland real estate
investment trust (" _Transferor_ "), pursuant to that certain First
Transaction Agreement, dated as of January 16, 2019, among Transferor, HPT TA
Properties Trust, HPT TA Properties LLC, HPT PSC Properties Trust, HPT PSC
Properties LLC, TravelCenters of America LLC, TravelCenters of America
Holdings Company LLC and TA Operating LLC, Transferor hereby certifies to TA
Operating LLC (" _Transferee_ ") the following:

 



 

1. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and income tax regulations thereunder);

 



 

2. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

 



 

3. [INSERT HPT SELLER], which has legal title to one or more transferred U.S. real property interests under local law, is disregarded as an entity separate from Transferor for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

 



 

4. Transferors U.S. employer identification number is 04-3262075; and

 



 

5. Transferors office address is Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458.

 



 

The undersigned and Transferor understand that this certificate may be
disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and any transferee and
that any false statement contained herein could be punished by fine,
imprisonment, or both.

 



 

 _[Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page follows.]_

     

 

 



 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and I further declare that I have the authority to sign this document on
behalf of Transferor.
