AGREEMENT

AND

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") entered into as of the
9th day of January, 2007, by and between PLACER SIERRA BANCSHARES ("Company"),
a California corporation, and WELLS FARGO and COMPANY ("Wells Fargo"), a
Delaware corporation.

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to effect a reorganization whereby a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo incorporated under the laws of the
State of California ("Merger Co.") will merge with and into Company (the
"Merger") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement")
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, which provides, among
other things, for the conversion of the shares of Common Stock of Company, of
no par value per share ("Company Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with
the provisions of the Merger Agreement into the right to receive shares of
voting Common Stock of Wells Fargo of the par value of $1 2/3 per share
("Wells Fargo Common Stock"); and

WHEREAS, as a condition and an inducement to Wells Fargos willingness to
enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, certain shareholders of Company have executed and delivered an
agreement with Wells Fargo pursuant to which, among other things, such
shareholders have agreed to vote all shares of Company Common Stock owned by
them in favor of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, the
parties to this Agreement intend to effect the merger of Merger Co. with and
into the Company, with the Company being the corporation surviving such Merger
and it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the business
combination contemplated hereby be treated as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Wells Fargo and the
Company deem it is in the best interests of their respective companies
and their shareholders to consummate the transactions provided for in this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, to effect such reorganization and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties
hereto do hereby represent, warrant, covenant, and agree as follows:

1\. Basic Plan of Reorganization

(a) _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Merger
Co. will be merged by statutory merger with and into Company pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, with Company as the surviving corporation, in which Merger
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below)
(other than shares as to which statutory dissenters appraisal rights have    been exercised and other than shares of Company Common Stock owned, directly
or indirectly, by Wells Fargo or the Company (other than shares of
Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties ("Trust Account Shares"), and any shares
of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Wells Fargo or any of their
respective subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted ("DPC
Shares")) will be converted into the right to receive, and exchanged for
certificates or direct registration statements representing the number of
shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock equal to (i) if the Wells Fargo Measurement
Price is equal to or less than $32.5783, then .8595 shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock, (ii) if the Wells Fargo
Measurement Price is greater than $32.5783 but less than $39.8179, the
quotient determined by dividing $28.00 by the Wells Fargo Measurement Price
(such quotient to be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth), and (iii) if the
Wells Fargo Measurement Price is greater to or equal to $39.8179, then .7032
shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock (in
each case subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs 1(c) or 9(a))
(the "Merger Exchange Ratio"). The "Wells Fargo Measurement Price" is defined
as the volume weighted average of the daily volume weighted average price of a
share of Wells Fargo Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
only as reported by Bloomberg LP for each of the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately prior to the "Closing
Date" (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below) (the "Condition Date"), rounded to
the nearest ten-thousandth.

(b) _Conversion of Company Options_. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
each option (granted by Company or, in the case of stock options of acquired
entities, assumed by Company) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
any stock option plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Date of the
Merger (each, a "Company Stock Option"), shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of the Company Common Stock, such Stock Options and Company
Stock Option Plans shall be assumed by Wells Fargo and such Company Stock
Options shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of
Wells Fargo Common Stock (each, a "Substitute Option") in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

(i) The number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock to be subject to the
Substitute Option shall be the product (rounded down to the nearest share) of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option by (B) the Merger Exchange Ratio; and

(ii) The exercise price per share of Wells Fargo Common Stock under the
Substitute Option shall be equal to the result (rounded down to the nearest
cent) of dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
under the Company Stock Option by (B) the Merger Exchange Ratio. 

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options that are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be and is
intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of
the Code.



 

-2- (c) _Wells Fargo Common Stock Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time of the Merger as defined below, shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period (a "Common
Stock Adjustment"), then the number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock
issuable pursuant to subparagraph (a), above, will be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted so that the number of such shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock issuable in the Merger will equal the number of shares of Wells
Fargo Common Stock which holders of shares of Company Common Stock would
have received pursuant to such Common Stock Adjustment had the record date
therefor been immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock and
no certificates or scrip certificates therefor shall be issued to represent
any such fractional interest, and any holder thereof shall be paid an amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder is entitled by the Wells Fargo Measurement
Price.

(e) _Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock and Preferred Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by
Wells Fargo, other than Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares, shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no capital stock of Wells Fargo or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(f) _Mechanics of Closing Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall be executed and officers
certificates prescribed by Section 1103 of the California General Corporation
Law ("CGCL") shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
California within five (5) business days following the first business day
occurring after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent set
forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Agreement and after expiration of the
period for determining which shares of Company Common Stock are eligible to be
"Perfected Dissenting Shares" as provided in paragraph 1302 of the CGCL or on
such other date as may be agreed to by the parties (the "Closing Date"),
_provided_ that the Closing Date shall not occur on the last business day of a
calendar month. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees to use its best efforts to cause the Merger to be
completed as soon as practicable after the receipt of all final regulatory
approvals of the Merger and the expiration of all required statutory waiting
periods. The time that the filing referred to in the first sentence of this
paragraph is made is herein referred to as the "Time of Filing." The day on
which such filing is made and accepted is herein referred to as the "Effective
Date of the Merger." The "Effective Time of the Merger" shall be 11:59 p.m.,
Central time, on the Effective Date of the Merger. At the Effective Time of
the Merger on the Effective Date of the Merger, the separate existence of
Merger Co. shall cease and Merger Co. will be merged with and into Company
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. "Perfected Dissenting Shares" shall mean
shares of Company Common Stock for which all requisite actions to be treated
as dissenting shares pursuant to Section 1300 of the CGCL have been taken.



 

-3- The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the Closing Date at the offices
of Wells Fargos Law Department in San Francisco, California.

(g) _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Wells Fargos election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (i) Company is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo,
(ii) any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo is merged
with and into Company, or (iii) Company is merged with and into Wells Fargo;
_provided, however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or change the
amount or kind of consideration to be issued to Companys shareholders in the
Merger or under such alternative structure (the "Merger Consideration"), (B)
adversely affect the tax treatment of Companys shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration or prevent the parties from obtaining the
opinion referred to in paragraph 6(h), or (C) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger. In the event of such election, the parties agree
to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect
such election.

(h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who shall be
entitled to be paid the "fair market value" of such holders Perfected
Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL, shall only be
entitled to receive such payment provided for in Section 1300 of the CGCL
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or withdraw or lost
such holders rights under Section 1300 of the CGCL. 

2\. Representations and Warranties of Company. Except as set forth in a
confidential disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Wells Fargo in
conjunction with the execution of this Agreement, which identifies exceptions

business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted except where the failure to have
such power and authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Company is
registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB")
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act").
Company has furnished Wells Fargo true and correct copies of its and the
Company Subsidiaries (as defined in paragraph 2(b)) articles of incorporation
and bylaws, as amended and in effect on the date of this Agreement, and

security of any Company Subsidiary is or may be required to be issued by

with generally accepted accounting principles, and Company has not received
notice from the SEC questioning the accuracy or completeness of any
certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley to be included in any Company Report
filed with the SEC. Company (A) has designed disclosure controls and
procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed and implemented under its
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of
Company by others within those entities and (B) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, to Companys auditors and the audit committee of Companys
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect
Companys ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data
and have identified for Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Companys internal
controls. Company has made available to Wells Fargo a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to Companys auditors and audit committee since

interest in any material contract or property (real or personal), tangible or
intangible, used in or pertaining to the business of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, disclosure of which is required to be made in the Company Reports
or pursuant to applicable Nasdaq regulations.

term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA or
violated any of the fiduciary standards under Part 4 of Title 1 of ERISA
which could subject such Plan or trust, or any trustee, fiduciary or

a whole.

and the Merger Agreement.

(viii) Except as disclosed in Schedule 2(p)(viii), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement nor the consummation of

Company has previously been fully accrued for in Companys Financial
Statements,  



 

-14-  neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any agreement,

4(c), and at the Effective Time of the Merger, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All documents which
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are responsible for filing with the SEC
and any other regulatory authority in connection with the Merger will comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of applicable
law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by Wells Fargo that is
contained in the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any other
documents to be filed with the SEC or any regulatory authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Merger Agreement.

(r) _Registration Obligations_. Except for the Registration Rights Agreement
with California Community Financial Institutions Fund Limited Partnership
("Fund") or as described on Schedule 2(r), neither Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or otherwise, by reason of any
agreement to register any of its securities under the Securities Act. All

representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance
with the terms of the governing documents and applicable state and
federal law and regulation and common law. Neither Company, any Company
Subsidiary, nor any director, officer or employee of Company or any Company
Subsidiary has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account which is material to, or could reasonably be expected to

account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect
the assets of such fiduciary account.

default, under any material agreement, indenture, loan agreement or other
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its assets is bound
or to which any of its assets is subject, the result of which has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the best of
Companys knowledge, all parties with whom Company or any Company Subsidiary

statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,

disclosed in Schedule 2(v), to the best of Companys knowledge, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim or action; except as disclosed
in Schedule 2(v), and to the best of Companys knowledge neither Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, or
decree by or with any court, governmental authority or third party imposing
any such environmental liability. Company has provided Wells Fargo with copies

trademarks, trade names, copyrights, technology and processes used by Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in their respective businesses which are used
pursuant to a license or other right granted by a third party, excluding
computer software purchased with a shrink-wrap license (the "Licensed
Intellectual Property," and together with the Proprietary Intellectual
Property herein referred to as the "Intellectual Property"). Company and each
Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right to use pursuant to valid and
effective agreements, all Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to
the best knowledge of the Company and each Subsidiary, threatened against
Company or any Company Subsidiary by any person with respect to the use of any
Intellectual Property or challenging or questioning the validity or
effectiveness of any license or agreement relating to such Intellectual
Property. To the best knowledge of the Company, the current use by Company and
each Company Subsidiary of the Intellectual Property does not infringe on the
rights of any person, except for such infringements which in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are
no pending claims or charges brought by Company or any Company Subsidiary
against any person with respect to the use of any Intellectual Property or
the enforcement of any of Companys or any Company Subsidiarys rights
relating to the Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in Schedule 2(w),
Company has not signed a confidentiality agreement with, executed an
agreement with, or, to the Companys knowledge, entered into negotiations
with, A2D, LP (or any other person) relating to any license for interactive

matters set forth in that Company Fairness Opinion, the Merger Exchange Ratio
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the Company.

(bb) _Derivatives; Etc_. All exchange-traded, over-the-counter or other swaps,
caps, floors, collars, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and
other similar arranges of contracts ("Derivative Contracts"), whether entered
into for the Companys own account, or for the account of one or more of the
Companys Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered into (i) in
accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations, and regulatory policies, and (ii) with counterparties reasonably
believed to be financially responsible at the time, and each of them
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company  



 

-17-  of the Company Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms
(except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by
general equity principles), and are in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries, nor, to the best of the Companys knowledge,
any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such
Derivative Contract. The Companys Reports filed with the SEC disclose the
value of such agreements and arrangements on a mark-to-market basis in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, since September
30, 2006, there has not been a material change in such value.

3\. Representations and Warranties of Wells Fargo. Except as set forth in a
confidential disclosure schedule delivered by Wells Fargo to the Company in
conjunction with the execution of this Agreement, which identifies exceptions

follows:

(a) _Organization and Authority_. Wells Fargo is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in all jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified except where the failure to be

reason of any option, warrant, scrip, preemptive right, right to subscribe to,
call or commitment of any character whatsoever relating to, or security or
right convertible into, shares of any capital stock of such subsidiary, and
there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
any Wells Fargo Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of its capital
stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any
additional shares of its capital stock. Subject to 12 U.S.C. § 55 (1982), all
of such shares so owned by Wells Fargo are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned by it free and clear of any lien, claim, charge, option, encumbrance
or agreement with respect thereto. Each Wells Fargo Subsidiary is a
corporation or national banking association duly organized, validly existing,
duly qualified to do business and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted except where the failure to be so qualified or to have such
power and authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

any such lease, any material existing default by Wells Fargo or such Wells
Fargo Subsidiary or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,

insured or self insured, and during each of the past five (5) calendar years
(or during such lesser period of time as Wells Fargo has owned such Wells

(m) _Compliance with Laws; Controls_. 

(i) Wells Fargo and each Wells Fargo Subsidiary has all permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,

presently conducted and that are material to the business of Wells Fargo or
such Wells Fargo Subsidiary; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect, and to the best
knowledge of Wells Fargo, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is
threatened; and all such filings, applications and registrations are current.

(including, but not limited to Sarbanes-Oxley and the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001). Neither Wells Fargo nor any Wells Fargo Subsidiary is in material
default under any order, license, regulation or demand of any federal, state,
municipal or other governmental agency or with respect  



 

-22-  to any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court. Except for statutory
or regulatory restrictions of general application, no federal, state,

described in the Wells Fargo Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date

a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and Wells Fargo has not received notice from the SEC questioning
the accuracy or completeness of any certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley
to be included in any Wells Fargo Report filed with the SEC. Wells Fargo (A)
has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be
designed and implemented under its supervision) to ensure that material
information relating to Wells Fargo, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the management of Wells Fargo by others within those entities
and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Wells
Fargos auditors and the audit committee of Wells Fargos Board of Directors
(1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect in any material respect Wells Fargos
ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data and have
identified for Wells Fargos auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Wells Fargos internal
controls.

Subsidiary is pending or, to the best knowledge of Wells Fargo, threatened.

(iv) Except as set forth on Schedule 3(o), each Wells Fargo Plan intended to

adverse effect upon Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; to the
best of Wells Fargos knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any such
proceeding, claim or action; and to the best of Wells Fargos knowledge,

Indemnified Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding,
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time of the
Merger) (A) Wells Fargo shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Wells Fargo shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such

counsel satisfactory to it/them, and Wells Fargo shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements
therefor are received, _provided, however_ , that Wells Fargo shall be

having at least the same coverage and amounts thereof and containing material
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company insured under such policies) for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that in no
event shall Wells Fargo be required to pay in excess of two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium most recently paid by the Company or any
Subsidiary for such coverage; _provided, further,_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event such coverage is not available (or is only available
for an amount in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium most recently paid by the Company for such coverage), Wells Fargo
shall nevertheless use reasonable best efforts to provide such coverage as may
be obtained for such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount.

any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (B) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
Wells Fargo shall cause proper provisions to be made so that such continuing
or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this paragraph 5(m).

(v) The obligations of Wells Fargo under this paragraph 5(m) shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to, nor shall Wells Fargo take any

affected Indemnitee.
