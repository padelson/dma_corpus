Re: Final Binding Offer

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:



   1. | _Submission of Offer_. Biomet, Inc., an Indiana corporation ("
_Buyer_ "), is pleased to submit this final and binding offer (this " _Offer_
") to DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., an Indiana corporation (" _Seller_ "), for the
acquisition of certain assets, and the assumption of certain liabilities, of
the Business (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement referred to below)
(the " _Acquisition_ "), on the terms and subject only to the conditions set
forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement attached to this Offer as _Exhibit 1_
and duly executed and delivered by Buyer (including the Disclosure Letter and
the Schedules and Exhibits thereto, the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "). Buyer
hereby confirms that, if the Principal Closing Date occurred on the date
hereof, the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(a) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement would be satisfied, and Buyer hereby agrees to not take any action
prior to the earlier of (a) the Offer Acceptance (as defined below) and (b)
the Offer Termination Time (as defined below) that would cause such condition
not to be satisfied. Buyer hereby further agrees that it will comply with, and
will cause its Affiliates that are or will be parties to any Ancillary
Agreement to comply with, the covenants set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement during the period from the date of this Offer to the Offer
Termination Time (or, if this Offer is accepted by Seller in the manner
contemplated herein, to the time as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement)
such that there would not be a failure of the condition set forth in Section
5.02(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Buyer hereby further agrees that, in
order to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 5.02(g) of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, it will execute any amendments to the Asset Purchase
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.05 of the Asset Purchase Agreement as the FTC
or EC may request that are not materially adverse to Buyer. In the event that
the Asset Purchase Agreement is so amended, Buyer acknowledges that it shall
be deemed to have submitted this Offer on the terms and subject only to the
conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, as so amended.
Capitalized terms used in this Offer shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in the Asset Purchase Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. 
---|--- 



   2. | _Offer Termination Time; Survival_. Except as expressly set forth
herein, this Offer is irrevocable by Buyer. Unless previously accepted by
Seller, in accordance with paragraph 3, this Offer will terminate upon the
earlier of (i) the Automatic Termination Time (as defined below) and (ii) the
time at which this Offer is terminated by Buyer pursuant to paragraph 8 below (such earlier time, the " _Offer Termination Time_ "). Upon
the occurrence of the Offer Termination Time, this Offer will become void and
be of no further force or effect, with no liability on the part of either
Buyer of Seller (or any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors officers,
employees or agents), except that the provisions of this paragraph 2 and
paragraphs 6, 8, 10 and 11 shall survive any such termination and remain in
full force and effect, and no such termination shall relieve Buyer or Seller
from any liability for any breach of any agreement of such party set forth in
this Offer prior to such termination.



   3. | _Offer Acceptance and Extension_. Seller may accept this Offer by
executing and delivering to Buyer a countersignature to the Asset Purchase
Agreement no later than the Offer Termination Time. Delivery of the executed
countersignature to the Asset Purchase Agreement may be made by Seller to
Buyer in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 11.07 of
the Asset Purchase Agreement (the " _Offer Acceptance_ "). The term
"Automatic Termination Time" shall mean 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on
June 1, 2012; _provided_ , _however_ , if Seller determines that, in light of
the status of the information and/or consultation processes with the
employees representative bodies of Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with the Acquisition (the " _Consultation Processes_ "), it is advisable to
continue such Consultation Processes for an additional period before Seller
makes a decision with respect to the Offer, Seller may extend the Automatic
Termination Time from time to time in consecutive increments of up to fourteen
days each; _provided further_ , if Buyer elects to do so for any reason,
Buyer may extend the Automatic Termination Time from time to time in
consecutive increments of up to fourteen days each; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Automatic Termination Time be extended
by either Buyer or Seller beyond 11:59 P.M., New York time, on July 15, 2012.
The party extending the Automatic Termination Time shall provide notice to the
other party of any extension of the Automatic Termination Time no later than
three business days prior to the then current Automatic Termination Time.
Seller agrees that, if Seller determines that all the Consultation Processes
are completed, Seller shall promptly make a decision whether or not to accept
the Offer, and following such decision, Seller shall promptly communicate
such decision to Buyer and, in the event such decision is to accept the Offer,
promptly deliver the Offer Acceptance. 
---|--- 
 



   4. | _Acknowledgement_. Buyer hereby confirms to Seller that this
Offer is binding, and may not be revoked by Buyer in any respect or for any
reason prior to the Offer Termination Time except as expressly set forth
herein. Buyer hereby acknowledges that Seller is relying on this Offer and the
promises, representations, warranties and covenants of Buyer contained herein.

promises, representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained
herein.

   5. |

_Exclusivity_. Seller hereby agrees that, during the period beginning on the
date hereof and continuing until the earlier of (a) the Offer Acceptance and
(b) the Offer Termination Time (the " _Exclusivity Period_ "), Seller and its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and any attorney,
accountant and other representative retained by any of them (collectively,
the " _Seller Parties_ "), will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action designed or reasonably likely to
facilitate, any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal (as defined
below), (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect to, any
Alternative Proposal or (iii) enter into any letter of intent or similar
arrangement or any agreement with respect to any Alternative Proposal. For 

---|--- 
 



2  purposes of this paragraph 5, the term " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, for an acquisition or other business combination with respect
to the Business or any material portion of the Transferred Assets. For
purposes of this Offer, any action taken by a Seller Party that violates the
first sentence of this paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be a failure by Seller
to comply with this paragraph 5.



   6. | _Publicity_. With respect to this Offer and the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer and Seller
hereby agree to comply with the restrictions set forth in Section 6.02 of the
Asset Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting
Sellers ability to make such disclosures as may be required by applicable
Law, in connection with the Consultation Processes Seller may make available
to the applicable employees representative bodies of Seller and its
Affiliates such information as Seller determines is reasonably necessary to
effect such Consultation Processes.  
---|--- 



   7. | _Consultation Process; Consents; Seller Covenants and
Representations_. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 1 of this Offer
or the following sentences of this paragraph 7, (a) Buyer hereby agrees to
cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist Seller (as
contemplated by Section 6.03 of the Asset Purchase Agreement) in effecting the
Consultation Processes, including providing such information to, and
attending such meetings with, the applicable employees representative bodies,
in each case as may be required by applicable Laws or practices or as may be
reasonably requested by Seller or such employees representative bodies or
their respective agents or advisors in connection with the Consultation
Processes and (b) Buyer and Seller hereby agree, as permitted by applicable
Law, to commence the filing and obtaining of consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities
and other third parties as contemplated by Section 6.03 as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof. Seller agrees to comply with Section 6.03
of the Asset Purchase Agreement as if it signed the Asset Purchase Agreement
as of the date hereof, including with respect to effecting the Consultation
Processes. Seller further agrees to comply with the other Sections of Article
VI and Section 8.01(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement as if it signed the
Asset Purchase Agreement as of the date hereof. Seller hereby confirms that,
if the Principal Closing Date occurred on the date hereof, the conditions set
forth in Section 5.01(a) of the Asset Purchase Agreement would be satisfied
with respect to Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.06 and 3.15 of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, and Seller hereby agrees to not take any action prior to the
earlier of (a) the Offer Acceptance and (b) the Offer Termination Time that
would cause such condition not to be satisfied hereof. 
---|--- 



   8. |

_Termination by Buyer, Fees_. This Offer may be terminated by Buyer by written
notice to Seller (such notice to be delivered in accordance with the notice
provisions set forth in Section 11.07 of the Asset Purchase Agreement), at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance, if (a) Seller shall have failed to comply
with any of Sellers covenants or agreements contained in paragraph 5 in any
material respect; or (b) Buyer would have been entitled to terminate the Asset
Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 thereof (subject to complying with
the terms of such Section), assuming Seller had also signed the Asset
Purchase Agreement as of the date hereof. If (A) this Offer terminates
pursuant to paragraph 2 and (B)(1) at the Offer Termination Time, Buyer would
have been entitled to receive the termination fee pursuant to Section 9.03
of the Asset Purchase Agreement, assuming Seller had also signed the Asset
Purchase Agreement as of the date hererof, and assuming the Asset Purchase
Agreement was terminated at the Offer Termination Time or (2) this Offer is
terminated by Buyer as a result of a breach by Seller of clause (ii) or (iii)
of paragraph 5, then Seller shall promptly (but in 

---|--- 
 



3  any event not more than five Business Days following the Offer Termination
Time) pay to Buyer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by Buyer an amount equal to such termination
fee. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this paragraph 8 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Offer, and that, without these agreements, neither Seller nor Buyer would
have entered into this Offer. Accordingly, if Seller fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this paragraph 8, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Buyer commences any action which results in an award of, or a Judgment
against Seller for, such termination fee (or any portion thereof), Seller
shall pay Buyers reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with such action,
together with interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate
prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal from the date
such amount was required to be paid until the date actually received by Buyer.

 



   9. | _Date of the Asset Purchase Agreement_. Buyer and Seller hereby
agree that the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement as used therein shall be
deemed to be the date hereof. 
---|--- 



   10. | _Governing Law_. This Offer shall be governed by the law of the
State of New York without reference to the choice of law doctrine of such
state. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising from or related in any way
to this Offer or the interpretation, application, breach, termination or
validity thereof, including any claim of inducement of this Offer by fraud or
otherwise, will be subject to the arbitration and mediation provisions of
Sections 11.12 and 11.13 of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 



   11. | _Countersignature_. Seller shall countersign and return to Buyer
on and as of April 2, 2012, one of the two enclosed original copies of this
letter to confirm (i) Sellers acknowledgement of the terms of this Offer,
(ii) Sellers agreements and acknowledgements set forth herein and (iii) its
acceptance of the governing law and dispute resolution procedures contemplated
by paragraph 10 of this Offer. Sellers countersignature of this Offer shall
in no event create any binding obligations on Seller except as expressly set
forth herein. The parties acknowledge and agree that, unless the Offer
Acceptance occurs, Seller shall not be under any obligation to sell or
transfer to Buyer or any of its Affiliates any portion of the Business or to
execute the Asset Purchase Agreement or any other agreements in respect of the
Acquisition, and except as set forth herein, Seller shall have no liability
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates in the event of any determination by Seller
