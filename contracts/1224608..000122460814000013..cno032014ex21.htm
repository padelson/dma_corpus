the Final Adjustment Statement on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, the amount or computation with respect to such item as set forth in

the parties.

(iv) For a period of 10 Business Days beginning on the date that Buyer
receives a Dispute Notice, if any, Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve by mutual agreement all matters identified in the Dispute
Notice. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve by mutual
agreement any matter in the Dispute Notice within such 10 Business Day period,

other



16 Person, as mutually agreed by the parties hereto (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), to make a determination in a final and binding arbitration with
respect to all matters in dispute.

(v) Buyer and Seller will direct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
determination within 30 days after its retention (or within such other period
as mutually agreed), and Buyer, Seller and their respective employees and
agents will cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm during its
engagement. Buyer and Seller shall promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days) after the Independent Accounting Firm's engagement, each submit
to the Independent Accounting Firm their respective computations of the
disputed items identified in the Dispute Notice and information, arguments and
support for their respective positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy
of such materials to the other party. Each party shall then be given an
opportunity to supplement the information, arguments and support included in
its initial submission with one additional submission to respond to any
arguments or positions taken by the other party in such other party's initial
submission, which supplemental information shall be submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy thereof to the other party) within
five Business Days after the first date on which both parties have submitted
their respective initial submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall thereafter be permitted to request
additional or clarifying information from the parties, and each of the parties
shall cooperate and shall cause their Representatives to cooperate with such
requests of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine, based solely on the materials so presented by the parties and
upon information received in response to such requests for additional or
clarifying information and not by independent review, only those issues in
dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall render a
written report to Buyer and Seller (the "Adjustment Report") in which the
Independent Accounting Firm shall, after considering all matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice, determine what adjustments, if any, should be made to the
amounts and computations set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement solely as
to the disputed items and shall determine the appropriate Final Adjustment
Amount on that basis.

(vi) The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Independent Accounting Firm's determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions,
if any, to be made to the Final Adjustment Statement, together with supporting
calculations. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm
(x) shall be bound to the principles of this Section 2.5 and the terms of this
Agreement, (y) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the
Dispute Notice and (z) shall not assign a value to any item higher than the
highest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either party. The Adjustment Report shall have
the same force and effect as an arbitration award governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq.

(vii) All fees and expenses relating to the work of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller. The Adjustment Report,
absent fraud, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and shall be
deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each of Buyer and Seller,
and no party shall seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or
otherwise, other than to confirm and enforce the Adjustment Report pursuant to
the jurisdictional provisions of Section 10.7(a).



17 

(viii) The final form of the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
Date as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 is referred to herein
as the "Final Balance Sheet" and the amount of the Closing Statutory Value
calculated therefrom is referred to as the "Final Closing Statutory Value."
The provisions of this Section 2.5 represent the sole and exclusive method for
determining the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statutory Value.

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which jurisdictions constitute all
jurisdictions in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing (individually or in the
aggregate) would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of
the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational documents),
each as amended to the date hereof, of the Company (collectively, the
"Organizational Documents").



SECTION 3.2. Capital Structure.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 5,250,000 shares

fully paid and non-assessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights.
There are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of the Shares pursuant
to the Organizational Documents of the Company or any agreement to which
Seller, CDOC or the Company is a party. Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities, options, warrants,
rights, commitments or agreements of any kind (other than this Agreement)
obligating the Seller to sell or transfer any of the Shares, or obligating the
Company to issue, sell or deliver shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company.



18 None of the Shares were issued in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or
any other Applicable Law.

issuance or outstanding, and the Company has no obligation to issue any such
capital stock or other equity interests. CDOC is the record and beneficial
owner of all of the Shares, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,

to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than any Liens arising from
acts of Buyer and Liens applied as respects securities generally under
applicable securities laws.

SECTION 3.3. Subsidiaries. The Company has no Subsidiaries and does not own
any shares of the capital stock of, or other voting or equity interest in, any
Person, except for Investment Assets held in the ordinary course of business.



SECTION 3.4. Authority. Each Seller Party has the requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will
be a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution and delivery by each Seller Party of the Transaction Agreements to
which it is or will be a party and the consummation by each Seller Party of
the transactions contemplated thereby have been and, with respect to the
Transaction Agreements to be executed and delivered at Closing, will be, duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of such Seller Party.
Each of the Transaction Agreements to which a Seller Party is or will be a
party have been or, with respect to the Transaction Agreements to be executed
and delivered at the Closing, will be, duly executed and delivered by such
Seller Party and, assuming the Transaction Agreements constitute valid and

the operation of the Annuity Business) (i) has committed any breach or
violation of Applicable Law that has, since December 31, 2010, resulted in, or

Laws, or (iii) to the Knowledge of Seller, is under investigation, examination
or audit with respect to any violation of any Applicable Law (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Applicable Law relating to unclaimed property or
escheat requirements), in each case other than any such item that has been
cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity,
or that is no longer being pursued by such Governmental Entity following a
response by the Company or Colonial Penn, as applicable, or that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company. Seller has provided Buyer with true and correct copies of the
Company's written compliance programs currently maintained to ensure
compliance with Applicable Laws regarding money laundering, privacy and
similar laws and regulations, including without limitation the USA Patriot
Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the rules and regulations of the Office

the Company owns, holds or possesses all permits, licenses, approvals,
authorizations, consents and registrations that are necessary to entitle it to

regarding any actual or proposed revocation, suspension or termination of, or
material modification to, any such Permit, in each case other than any such
item that has been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such
Governmental Entity, that is no longer being pursued by such Governmental
Entity following a response by the Company or that would not, individually or

such material Permits are valid and in full force and effect and (ii) the
Company is not in default under, and no condition exists that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default under, any such material

there is no Action pending against the Company and (ii) no Person has, in a
writing that was received by Seller's legal department from any source since

than any Action that would not reasonably be expected to have a material and
detrimental effect on the Company or would not reasonably be expected to have
the effect of preventing or materially delaying any of the transactions
contemplated by any Transaction Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, extra-
contractual "bad faith" and similar claims for punitive, consequential and

basis shall be considered to be ordinary course of business claims for payment
under the terms of Insurance Contracts. Except as disclosed in Section

which class action status has been sought or granted against the Company from
the applicable Governmental Entity before which such Action has been brought,

Company, and all endorsements, riders, applications and certificates

Guaranteed Elements, the Specified Litigation Matters and the other matters
set forth in this Section 3.22 (but only to the extent that such other matters
relate to the proposal, establishment, implementation, change or
administration of the Non-Guaranteed Elements, including the legality of

officer or director of the Company in connection with such officer's or
director's capacity as such.



SECTION 3.25. Tax Treatment of Insurance Contracts.

(a) All Insurance Contracts that constitute part of the Acquired Business that
are subject to Section 101(f) of the Code satisfy, in all material respects,
the requirements of that provision and otherwise qualify as life insurance
contracts for purposes of the Code, and all other Insurance Contracts that
constitute part of the Acquired Business (other than long-term care insurance
contracts or annuity contracts) satisfy in all material respects, the
requirements of Section 7702 of the Code and otherwise qualify as life
insurance contracts for purposes of the Code. All Insurance Contracts that
constitute part of the Acquired Business that are annuity contracts satisfy,
in all material respects, all applicable requirements of Sections 72 and 817
of the Code and otherwise qualify as annuity contracts for purposes of the
Code.

(c) With respect to all relevant Tax periods, Seller, the Company and their
respective Affiliates have materially complied with all reporting,
withholding, and disclosure requirements under the Code that are applicable to

Insurance Contracts in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Code, Treasury Regulations and forms issued by the IRS.

Code or other applicable Tax Law, as applicable to such Insurance Contracts.
In addition, none of Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
is a party to or has received written notice of any federal, state, local or

Tax treatment of any Insurance Contracts that constitute part of the Acquired
Business, or of any claims by the purchasers of the Insurance Contracts that
constitute part of the Acquired Business regarding the Tax treatment of such
Insurance Contracts or the plan or arrangement in connection with which such
Insurance Contracts were purchased.

(e) The Tax treatment of each Insurance Contract that constitutes part of the
Acquired Business is not, and since the time of issuance has not been,
materially less favorable to the purchaser, holder or intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Tax treatment under the Code (i) that was purported by the
Company to apply to such Insurance Contract in written materials provided by
the Company to such purchaser, holder or intended beneficiary at the time such
Insurance Contract was initially sold or issued or subsequently modified or
(ii) for which policies, products or contracts of that type were designed by
the Company to qualify at such time or were reasonably expected, based on
written materials provided by the Company to such purchaser, holder or
intended beneficiary at the time such Insurance Contract was initially sold or
issued or subsequently modified, to qualify at such time, except for changes
resulting from changes to the Code after the time of such sale, issuance or
modification.

(f) With respect to each Insurance Contract that constitutes a part of the
Acquired Business and that is used to fund an "employee pension benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) for which the Company serves as the
"administrator" (as defined in Section 3(16)(a) of ERISA), there has been no
breach by the Company of its contractual obligations under such Insurance
Contract that could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
effect on the Tax treatment of such Insurance Contract or its treatment
pursuant to ERISA.

the extent that such breach arises out of SSDMF Matters or the other matters

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject

of Buyer, any officer, director or employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
has been permanently or temporarily enjoined or barred by any order, judgment

present, in all material respects, the admitted assets, liabilities and
capital and surplus of Buyer at their respective dates and the results of
operations, changes in surplus and cash flows of Buyer at and for the periods
indicated, subject, in the case of the financial statements referenced in
clause (ii) above, to normal year-end adjustments. Buyer did not utilize any

and expenses, each of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer and assuming the
accuracy of the representations, warranties, covenants, certifications or
deliveries of Seller set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company, will be Solvent. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements with the intent of Buyer to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or



39 future creditors of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or of the Company. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent," when used with respect to

"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (x) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including a
reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Law
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (y) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person with respect
to its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such
debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such
date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including a
reasonable estimate of contingent and other liabilities" means that such
Person will be able to generate enough cash to meet its obligations as they
become due.



SECTION 4.11. Brokers. Buyer is solely responsible for the payment of the fees
and expenses of any broker, investment banker, financial adviser or other
Person acting in a similar capacity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Buyer or any Affiliate.

SECTION 5.3. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions and other agreements set forth in this Agreement, each of the

relate. In connection therewith, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to (v) make all legally required filings as promptly as

Applicable Law, provide such information and communications to Governmental
Entities as such Governmental Entities may request; (x) take all steps that

challenging any of the Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated

delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including by using its commercially reasonable efforts
to have vacated or reversed any stay or temporary restraining order entered
with respect to the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction
Agreements by any Governmental Entity; and (z) consent to and comply with any
condition imposed by any Governmental Entity on its grant of any such permit,

expects to obtain from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, or (C) results in a material impairment on the
ability of the Company after the Closing, pursuant to the Lifetrend RSA, to
implement, in all material respects, the Schedule NGE Changes, or, in the case
of Seller, (X) would require Seller to provide any guarantee or incur any
liability with respect to the Company before or after the Closing Date,
increase the reserves of the Company prior to the Closing or restrict the

copies of all applications or other communications to Governmental Entities in
connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing or submission thereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4(a) to the contrary, neither party

44 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Indiana Department of
Insurance, not later than 5:00 p.m., Central Standard Time on the tenth (10th)
Business Day following the date hereof, requests for approval of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and (ii) Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to file with
applicable Insurance Regulators, not later than 5:00 p.m., Central Standard
Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date hereof, requests for
approval of the Restructuring Transactions, which requests shall include all
required exhibits. A reasonable time prior to furnishing any written materials
to any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements (x) with respect to clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, Buyer shall furnish Seller with a copy thereof, and Seller shall
have a reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon and (y) with respect
to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, Seller shall furnish Buyer with a
copy thereof, and Buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments thereon. Each party shall give to the other party prompt written
notice if it receives any notice or other communication from any Insurance
Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, and, in the case of any such notice or communication which is in
writing, shall promptly furnish the other party with a copy thereof. If any
Insurance Regulator requires that a hearing be held in connection with any
such approval, each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange for such hearing to be held promptly after the notice that such
hearing is required has been received by such party. Each party shall give to
the other party reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any
meetings, telephone calls or other conferences may be held by it with any
Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and
such Insurance Regulator, the other party shall have the right to have a
representative or representatives attend or otherwise participate in any such
meeting, telephone call or other conference.

(c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's filings, applications and
other documents filed or submitted to Governmental Entities in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements may include a
request for approval of a merger of the Company with and into Buyer to be
effected concurrently with or promptly following the Closing. Neither the
ability to effect such merger transaction nor the receipt of any consent or
approval of a Governmental Entity or other third party required in order to
effect such merger transaction shall be a condition to the consummation of
either party's obligations under this Agreement. In the event that it becomes
reasonably apparent that any applicable Governmental Entity will not grant its
approval to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements in
whole or in part due to any facts related to such merger transaction, then
Buyer shall, upon the written request of Seller, abandon such merger
transaction, promptly submit any new or amended filings, applications or other
documents with the applicable Governmental Entities to exclude such merger
transaction from the applications and other filings it previously submitted to
such Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
consummate as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. Buyer's filings, applications and other documents
filed or submitted to Governmental Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements may not include a
request for



45 approval of any other ancillary transaction that is reasonably likely to not
be approved or to materially delay or impede consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 5.5. Public Announcements. Each of Buyer and Seller, and their
respective Affiliates, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (including regarding its plans
relating to employees, Producers or other third parties or with respect to the
funding or operation of the business of the Company) and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement with respect to such
matters without the advance approval of the other party following such
consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Applicable Law or by the requirements of any
securities exchange; provided, that, in the event that any party is required
under Applicable Law or the requirements of any securities exchange to issue
any such press release or make any public statement and it is not feasible to
obtain the advance approval of the other party hereto as required by this
Section 5.5, the party that issues such press release or makes such statement
shall provide the other party with notice and a copy of such press release or
statement as soon as reasonably practicable.



SECTION 5.6. Related Party Agreements. Except as set forth in Section 5.6 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (a) all of the intercompany arrangements
between Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, will be terminated immediately prior to
the Closing without any further obligations of the parties thereto following
termination, including by terminating the Company's participation in all
agreements between more than one of the Company's Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, and (b) Seller and its relevant Affiliate,
as applicable, will execute a Termination and Release Agreement substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, which includes a release of all such
liabilities and obligations of the Company, and (c) Seller shall cause all
intercompany balances between Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than
the Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to be paid
in full and settled immediately prior to the Closing or accrued and settled in
accordance with the adjustment mechanism contemplated by Section 2.5.



SECTION 5.7. Use of Names.

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to transfer any
and all right, title or interest, including all associated goodwill, which it
may have in or to the names, trademarks and service marks set forth in Section
5.7 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any name, trademark, service mark,
acronym or logo based on or incorporating the distinctive portions of any of
such names, trademarks or service marks (collectively, the "Seller
Trademarks"), or any Internet domain name containing all or a portion of a
Seller Trademark or set forth in Section 5.7 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, to Seller or as Seller may direct. Prior to the Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and act in good faith to negotiate a royalty-free
limited license agreement on mutually acceptable and commercially customary
terms (the "Trademark License Agreement") which shall, from and after the
Closing, permit the Company to use the "Conseco" name and related Intellectual
Property in connection with the operation of the Acquired Business for twelve
months following the Closing, but shall not include any license



46 to use such name and such related Intellectual Property in connection with
writing any new business. Buyer shall, prior to the date that is twelve months
after the Closing Date, change the name of the Company to a name that does not
include any reference to "Conseco" or any confusingly similar name or
derivative thereof.

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by the Trademark License Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof, (i) following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Company promptly to cease and discontinue any and all uses of the
Seller Trademarks, whether or not in combination with other words, symbols or
other distinctive or non-distinctive elements, and all trade, corporate or
business names, trademarks, tag-lines, identifying logos, trade dress,
monograms, slogans, service marks, domain names, brand names and other name or
source identifiers that are derivations, translations, adaptations,
combinations or variations of the Seller Trademarks or embodying any of the
foregoing whether or not in combination with other words, symbols or other
distinctive or non-distinctive elements and (ii) Buyer, for itself and its
Affiliates, agrees that any and all rights of the Company to the Seller
Trademarks, including any such rights licensed to the Company pursuant to any
other agreements or arrangements, whether written or oral, with Seller or its
Affiliates, shall terminate on the Closing Date without recourse by Buyer or
the Company. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall seek to register in
any jurisdiction any trade, corporate or business name, trademark, tag-line,
identifying logo, trade dress, monogram, slogan, service mark, domain name,
brand name or other name or source identifier that is a derivation,
translation, adaptation, combination or variation of the distinctive portions
of the Seller Trademarks.



SECTION 5.8. Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer shall (i) execute and
deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and shall take, or shall cause to
be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required or requested by
any party to carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements and (ii) shall refrain from taking any actions that
could reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or impede the
Closing.



SECTION 5.9. Access to Books and Records.

(a) Until the seventh anniversary of the Closing (after which anniversary
Buyer may destroy such records in its discretion, provided that Buyer shall
give 30 days' notice to Seller prior to destroying any records to permit
Seller, at its expense, to examine, duplicate or repossess such books and
records), Buyer shall afford promptly to Seller and its Representatives
reasonable access to the books and records of the Company for periods ended
prior to or as of the Closing Date, and provide information with respect to
the Company in a readily accessible form (including financial information in a
form consistent with the Company's historical practice for the preparation of
such financial information), to the extent reasonably required by Seller for
any lawful business purpose, including litigation and disputes (other than
litigation and disputes between or among the parties hereto and their
Affiliates), compliance, financial reporting (including financial audits of
historical information), loss reporting, regulatory, Tax and accounting
matters (including for any such matters related to the Transition Services
Agreement), and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its
Representatives to furnish



47 such books and records and information and make available officers and
employees of the Company for such purposes; provided, that such access does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any right to examine the books and records of the Company for any
periods that begin on or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, access to records relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively
by Section 8.4.

(b) Until the seventh anniversary of the Closing (after which anniversary
Seller may destroy such records in their discretion, provided that Seller
shall give 30 days' notice to Buyer prior to destroying any records to permit
Buyer, at its expense, to examine and duplicate such books and records),
Seller shall afford promptly to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable
access to the books and records retained by Seller or any of its Affiliates
relating to (i) for periods ended prior to or as of the Closing Date, the
Business or the affairs of the Company, and (ii) for periods ended on or after
the Closing Date, the Acquired Business or the affairs of the Company, and
provide information with respect to the Business or Acquired Business (as
applicable) and the affairs of the Company in a readily accessible form, to
the extent not transferred to Buyer at Closing (either directly or through its
ownership and control of the Company) and reasonably required by Buyer for any
lawful business purpose, including litigation, disputes, compliance, financial
reporting (including financial audits of historical information), loss
reporting, regulatory, Tax and accounting matters, and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives to furnish such books and records
and information and make available officers and employees of the Seller and
its Affiliates for such purposes; provided, that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, access to records relating to Taxes
shall be governed exclusively by Section 8.4.

(c) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
to determine the format, timing of, and the electronic systems or other means
of delivery of, the books and records of the Company in the possession of
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company).



SECTION 5.10. DandO Liabilities. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any steps that would reasonably
be expected to affect adversely the rights of any individual who served as a
director or officer of the Company at any time prior to the Closing Date
(each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") to be indemnified, either under Applicable
Law or the Organizational Documents of the Company as they existed prior to
the Closing Date, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses of investigation, defense and ongoing monitoring), judgments,
penalties, fines, losses, charges, demands, actions, suits, proceedings,
settlements, assessments, deficiencies, Taxes, interest, obligations, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date and relating to the fact that the DandO Indemnified Person was a director
or officer of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing Date. Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
hereby expressly releases, surrenders, forgives and waives any and all rights
or claims it has or may in the future have against any director or officer of
the Company, solely in their capacities as such,



48 with respect to any matter arising or existing at any time period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.11. Investment Assets.

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell to a
third party or transfer to Seller or its Affiliates at or prior to the Closing
each of the Investment Assets set forth in Section 5.11(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, in each case at a purchase price (payable in cash or
securities that would otherwise comply with the Investment Guidelines as
defined below) equal to the fair market value with respect to such Investment
Assets.

(b) Between the date hereof and April 1, 2014, the parties shall cooperate and
work together in good faith to review the mortgage loans included in the
Company's investment portfolio to determine and mutually agree whether any
such mortgage loans will be transferred in accordance with Section 5.11(a) or
otherwise in connection with the Restructuring.

(c) After the date hereof and through the Closing Date, except as set forth in
Section 5.11(a) or Section 5.11(b), Seller shall cause the Company's
Investment Assets to be managed in accordance with the investment guidelines
attached as Section 5.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule hereto (the
"Investment Guidelines").

SECTION 5.12. Non-Solicitation of Employees. For a period of 24 months
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, whether directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment, employ or contract for the services of any Person who
is employed by or engaged in the business of Seller or any of its Affiliates
in a senior management position (being a Director or more senior); provided,
that nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall prohibit Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) from engaging in general solicitations not
directed at such Persons, or from soliciting, employing or contracting for the
services of any such Person whose employment with or engagement by Seller and
its Affiliates has been terminated by Seller or its applicable Affiliate or
who has otherwise ceased to be employed or engaged by Seller or any of its
Affiliates for a period of at least six months prior to the first contact by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates with such Person.



SECTION 5.13. Transition Planning.

(a)Subject to compliance with Applicable Law (including applicable antitrust
laws and regulatory restrictions), Seller and Buyer shall, on or as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof, establish a joint migration and
transition committee (the "Transition Committee") comprising an equal number
of representatives appointed by each party having the requisite skills,
knowledge and experience to oversee and manage the implementation of
Transition Services (as such term is defined in the Transition Services
Agreement), including (i) delivering detailed timetables and plans as to the
steps each party shall take in relation to the Transition Services in order to
(A) maintain the status quo with respect to the Acquired Business as much as
reasonably possible and ensure continuity and lack of disruption in servicing
the Acquired Business and (B) support the timely migration of the Acquired
Business to the Buyer in a state such that Buyer will, no later than the time
at which the obligation to provide any particular



49 service under the Transition Services Agreement is terminated, be capable of
operating and managing such Acquired Business in a competent and functional
manner without the benefit of receiving such service under the Transition
Services Agreement (the "Separation Plan"), and (ii) overseeing the
performance of obligations under the Transition Services Agreement from and
after the Closing (including performance charging and any extension or
termination of Transition Services thereunder); provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, nothing
herein shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide Excluded
Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) to Buyer, the
Company or any of their Affiliates from and after the Closing. The Transition
Committee shall be co-chaired by a representative of Seller and a
representative of Buyer (each such co-chair, a "Service Coordinator"), and
shall meet in person at a mutually agreed-upon location (which may vary
depending on the number and nature of the meetings), or through any other
medium through which all participants in the meeting can hear each other, as
frequently as the Transition Committee may reasonably determine. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear their own costs associated with the establishment and
operation of the Transition Committee. Any decision made by the Transition
Committee shall require the approval of at least one appointee of Seller and
one appointee of Buyer.

(b)Buyer and Seller shall ensure that the Transition Committee shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to establish the Separation Plan as promptly
as practicable and, in any event, within 90 days after the date hereof. The
Separation Plan shall include timetables and plans relating to the following
(and in each case subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents):

(c) Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the parties shall direct all
initial communications relating to the Separation Plan and the Transition
Services Agreement to the Service Coordinators. Either party may replace its
Service Coordinator at any time by providing written notice of such
replacement to the other party. In the event a dispute arises with respect to
the Transition Services Agreement or the Separation Plan or its
implementation, the parties will conduct face to face or telephonic
negotiations between the parties' respective internal subject matter experts
who serve on the Transition Committee, which negotiations shall be conducted
within five Business Days following a written request from either party
("Level One Negotiations"). The parties shall ensure that their respective
members on the Transition Committee use their commercially reasonable efforts
and work together in good faith to resolve any such disagreements or disputes
as expeditiously as possible. If the Transition Committee is unable to resolve
the dispute within five Business Days after the parties have commenced Level
One Negotiations, then either party may request face to face negotiations
between the parties' respective Service Coordinators, which negotiations shall
be conducted within five Business Days of any such request ("Level Two
Negotiations"). If the Service Coordinators are unable to resolve the dispute
within five Business Days after the parties have commenced Level Two
Negotiations, either party may request face to face or telephonic negotiations
between a senior executive of Seller and a senior executive of Buyer, which
negotiations shall be conducted within five Business days after such request
("Level Three Negotiations"). If such executives are unable to resolve the
dispute within five Business Days after the parties have commenced Level Three
Negotiations, any unresolved dispute arising out of the interpretation,
performance, or breach of the provisions of this Agreement relating to the
Transition Services Agreement or the Separation Plan may be resolved pursuant
to Section 10.7 of this Agreement or Section 12.05 of the Transition Services
Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.13,
from and after the date hereof the Seller shall and shall cause the Company to
consult and cooperate with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the requests of, Buyer to undertake the preparatory work and planning
necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuity or transition of key
functional areas affecting the Company or the Acquired Business after the
Closing Date including, without limitation (i) conversion of specific
transition services identified by the Buyer, (ii) preparation of the Company's
quarterly financial and actuarial statements and reports, (iii) current and
prospective management of the Non-Guaranteed Elements, and (iv) current and
prospective management of the Investment Assets.

Closing Date, Seller shall furnish promptly to Buyer (a) a copy of each annual
statement and quarterly statement filed with the Indiana Department of
Insurance by the Company, and (b) any management financial reports prepared
with respect to the Company; provided, however, that nothing in clause (a) or
(b) of this Section 5.14 shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
prepare or furnish any report or other information that has not otherwise been
prepared in the ordinary course of business. In the event any annual or
quarterly statement prepared between the date hereof and the Closing Date
reflects the application of any statutory accounting practice permitted (as
opposed to prescribed) by the applicable Insurance Regulator, Seller shall,
contemporaneously with delivery of such report to Buyer, deliver to Buyer a
report setting forth a description of such permitted accounting practice.



51 

SECTION 5.15. Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any party
actively is contesting or defending against any claim, demand, action,
proceeding, suit or appeal in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (in each case other than any such claim, demand, action,
proceeding, suit or appeal between or among the parties hereto or their
Affiliates), each of the other parties shall reasonably cooperate with it and
its counsel in the defense or contest, make reasonably available their
personnel, and provide such testimony and reasonable access to their books and
records as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the defense or
contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending party
(unless the contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under the provisions of this Agreement).



SECTION 5.16. Due Diligence Materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller may retain one
copy of all materials provided or made available by Seller to Buyer during the
due diligence review of the Business by Buyer. Seller will deliver to Buyer,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, a compact disc
containing the contents of the "electronic" data room maintained by Seller in
connection with the sale of the Business to Buyer; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, such compact disc need not include any documents or
information not made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof.



SECTION 5.17. No Negotiation. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article IX, Seller will not, and will cause the Company
and Colonial Penn (with respect to the Annuity Business) and each of their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or
intentionally encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate
with, or provide any non-public information to, any Person (other than Buyer)
relating to any transaction involving the sale of the business or assets the
Company or Colonial Penn (as it relates to the Annuity Business), or any of
the capital stock of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, reinsurance transaction or similar transaction involving the
Company.



SECTION 5.18. Investment Management Agreement. At the Closing, Buyer shall,
and Seller shall cause 40|86 Advisors, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this
Agreement, and in any certificate furnished under Section 2.3(a)(ii) or
Section 2.3(b)(i) of this Agreement, shall survive the Closing solely for
purposes of this Article VII and shall terminate and expire at the end of the
calendar day by which a claim for indemnification with respect to such matter
must be made, as provided herein. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified
Persons, as



54 applicable, under this Article VII for any breach of any representation or
breach of warranty, or for any misrepresentation in any certificate furnished
under Section 2.3(a)(ii) or Section 2.3(b)(i) of this Agreement, unless on or
before the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date, the party seeking
indemnification notifies the other party of a claim specifying the factual
basis for the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the party
seeking indemnification; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing
limitations, (i) claims for indemnification based on a breach of the
representations and warranties made in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 3.4, 3.18
and paragraphs (d), (f), (j), (l), (m), (n), (o) and (p) of Section 3.10, and
Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.10 and 4.11 (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive the Closing until the expiration of their
applicable statutes of limitations and may be made at any time prior to such
expiration, (ii) claims for indemnification based on a breach of the
representations and warranties made in Section 3.2(b) shall survive the
Closing indefinitely, (iii) claims for indemnification based on a breach of
the representations and warranties made in Section 3.6(b) or in Section 3.10
(other than paragraphs (d), (f), (j), (l), (m), (n), (o) and (p) thereof)
shall not survive the Closing Date, (iv) claims for indemnification based on a
breach of the representations and warranties made in Sections 3.13, 3.15, 3.16
and 3.25 shall survive the Closing Date until the earlier of (A) the date that
is 22 months after the Closing Date and (B) the date that is one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Conversion Completion Date and (v) claims for
indemnification based on a breach of the representations and warranties made
in Section 3.22 shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12)
months.

(b) To the extent that any covenant in this Agreement is to be performed
solely prior to Closing, such covenant will survive and remain in effect in
accordance with its terms until, and a claim for a breach of such covenant may
be made any time prior to, the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date,
after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought
hereunder. To the extent that any covenant in this Agreement is to be
performed after the Closing, each such covenant in this Agreement will survive
and remain in effect until, and a claim for a breach of such covenant may be
made any time prior to, the date on which such covenant expires in accordance
with its terms, plus a period of six months thereafter, after which no claim
for indemnification with respect thereto may be brought hereunder.

(c) A claim for an Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv) may be
made at any time and will be validly made if the relevant Buyer Indemnified
Person notifies Seller of a claim specifying the factual basis for the claim
in reasonable detail to the extent then known by such Buyer Indemnified
Person; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no claim for indemnification in respect of an
Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv) that results from or arises
out of any Excluded Liability that is reinsured under, subject to or covered
by the WNIC Reinsurance Agreements, may be made unless and until the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Person has obtained in its favor a judgment or
arbitral award, as applicable, under the applicable provisions of such
agreement and the amount thereof is not paid by the applicable counterparty
(including any assignee thereof) within five (5) Business Days after
presentation of a written demand therefor; provided, however, that in the
event that such counterparty (and/or assignee) is, at the time any payment or
other obligation becomes due and payable in accordance with the terms of such
agreement, subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, rehabilitation, conservation or
a comparable proceeding under Applicable Law, Seller shall upon written demand
promptly pay the amount of such obligation to



55 the applicable Buyer Indemnified Person; provided, further, that upon such
payment Seller shall be subrogated to all rights and interests of the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Person and shall succeed to such rights and
interests of such Buyer Indemnified Person as may exist under the terms of
such agreement with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss, including the right to
assert any defenses available to the Buyer Indemnified Person with respect to
any matter relating thereto.

(d) A claim for an Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(iii) may be
made at any time and will be validly made if the relevant Seller Indemnified
Person notifies Buyer of a claim specifying the factual basis for the claim in
reasonable detail to the extent then known by such Seller Indemnified Person;
provided, however, that the availability of indemnification in respect of any
Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(iii) shall not in any way limit
or affect any right of any Seller Indemnified Person under any other
Transaction Agreement (including the Special Support Services Agreement), nor
shall any recovery by any Seller Indemnified Person under any such Transaction
Agreement limit or affect any right of any Seller Indemnified Person under
Section 7.2(b)(iii). The foregoing shall be subject to the last sentence of
Section 7.8.

(e) Any claim for indemnification in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss that is
not asserted by notice prior to the expiration of the specified period in
which such claim may be made shall not be valid and any right to
indemnification with respect to the matter in question is hereby irrevocably
waived after the expiration of such period; provided that any claim properly
made for an Indemnifiable Loss asserted prior to the expiration of the
specified period in which such claim may be made will be timely made for all
purposes hereof and such claim shall continue until fully and finally
resolved.



SECTION 7.2. Indemnification.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, on and after the Closing Date, the Company) (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller made in this
Agreement (other than those set forth in Section 3.10 or Section 3.25, which
are addressed in Article VIII, and in Section 3.22, which are addressed in
Section 7.2(a)(iii) below), and any misrepresentation in any certificate
furnished to Buyer by Seller under Section 2.3(a)(ii) of this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Seller under
this Agreement (other than those set forth in Article VIII, which are
addressed therein);

(iii) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller made in Section
3.22; or

(iv) the Excluded Liabilities.



56 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer made in this
Agreement and any misrepresentation in any certificate furnished to Seller by
Buyer under Section 2.3(b)(i) of this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant of Buyer under
this Agreement (other than those set forth in Article VIII, which are
addressed therein); or

(iii) any change to Non-Guaranteed Elements effected by the Company from and
after the Closing.

(c) For purposes of determining whether any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement has occurred, and for purposes of determining
the amount of an Indemnifiable Loss resulting from such breach, each such
representation and warranty (other than the first sentence of Section 3.8, the
first paragraph of Section 3.13(a), Section 3.13(a)(i), (iv), (xiii), (xvi)
and (xviii) and Section 3.22, and other than is inherent in the methods,
procedures and practices that constitute SAP or generally accepted actuarial
standards for purposes of Section 3.6 and Section 3.20), shall be read without
regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier contained
therein (including, for the avoidance of doubt, without regard to any
materiality qualifier in the text of Section 3.6 and Section 3.20).



SECTION 7.3. Certain Limitations.

(a) Except as provided below, no party shall be obligated to indemnify and
hold harmless its respective Indemnitees under Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section
7.2(a)(iii) (in the case of Seller) or Section 7.2(b)(i) (in the case of
Buyer) (i) with respect to any claim, unless such claim involves Indemnifiable
Losses in excess of $100,000 (the "Threshold Amount") (nor shall any claim
that does not exceed the Threshold Amount be applied to or considered for
purposes of calculating the amount of Indemnifiable Losses for which the
Indemnitor is responsible under clause (ii) below), and (ii) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under such
Section 7.2(a)(i) and Section 7.2(a)(iii), or under such Section 7.2(b)(i), as
the case may be, exceeds 2.0% of the Purchase Price for all Indemnifiable
Losses (the "Indemnification Basket"), at which point such Indemnitor shall be
liable to its respective Indemnitees for the value of the Indemnitee's claims
under Section 7.2(a)(i) and Section 7.2(a)(iii), or under such Section
7.2(b)(i), as the case may be, that is in excess of the Indemnification
Basket, but subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII. The
maximum aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other
hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any and all Indemnifiable Losses
arising under Sections 7.2(a)(i) or Section 7.2(a)(iii) (which shall also be
subject to the limitations set forth in clause (z) of the next sentence), in
the case of Seller, or Section 7.2(b)(i), in the case of Buyer, shall be 20%
of the Purchase Price (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (w) in no
event shall the limitations set forth in the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.3(a) apply with respect to claims for breaches of the Fundamental
Representations, (x) for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall



57 the limitations set forth in the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3(a)
apply with respect to Sections 7.2(a)(ii) or Section 7.2(a)(iv) or Section
7.2(b)(ii) or Section 7.2(b)(iii); (y) the maximum aggregate liability of
Buyer for any and all Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 7.2(b)(iii)
shall not exceed $1,000,000; and (z) the maximum aggregate liability of Seller
to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any and all Indemnifiable Losses arising
out of the Company's proposal, establishment, implementation, change or
administration of Non-Guaranteed Elements (including any Indemnifiable Losses
related to any Actions or regulatory proceedings with respect thereto and all
Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 7.2(a)(iii), but excluding any
Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 7.2(a)(ii) (solely with respect to
breaches of Section 5.1)) shall be 10% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of
Seller to all Buyer Indemnified Persons for all Indemnifiable Losses under
this Agreement (other than those arising under Section 7.2(a)(ii) (solely with
respect to breaches of Section 5.1), Section 7.2(a)(iv) or Section 8.1(a)(ii),
or from claims for fraud with a specific intent to deceive) shall not exceed
the Purchase Price.

(b) If any Buyer Indemnified Person actually recognizes a Tax benefit in
respect of an Indemnifiable Loss subsequent to an Indemnity Payment made by an
Indemnitor to an Indemnitee with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss, then such
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor the amount of such Tax benefit
recognized by such Buyer Indemnified Person up to the amount of such Indemnity
Payment received by the Indemnitee, net of any expenses incurred by such Buyer
Indemnified Person in pursuing such Tax benefit, within 15 days after the
Buyer Indemnified Person recognizes such Tax benefit in the form of cash
actually received or reduction in cash Taxes actually paid. If any Tax benefit
(or portion thereof) in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss that either (i)
reduces the Indemnity Payments made by an Indemnitor prior to the time such
payment is made or (ii) obligates an Indemnitee to make payments to the
Indemnitor under the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 7.3(b), is
disallowed as a result of an audit or otherwise, the applicable Indemnitor
shall promptly pay to the applicable Indemnitee the amount of such disallowed
Tax benefit within 30 days after the Indemnitee notifies the Indemnitor that
the adjustment with respect to such disallowance has been paid or otherwise
taken into account.

(c) The right to indemnification, payment of Indemnifiable Losses, or other
remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations under
this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver
of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
based on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation,
will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Indemnifiable Losses,
or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations.

(d) Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Indemnifiable Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum
amount recoverable with respect thereto under any insurance or reinsurance
coverage or other applicable source of recovery.



58 

SECTION 7.4. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:

(a) "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;

(b) "Indemnitor" means any Person required to provide indemnification under
this Agreement;

(c) "Indemnifiable Losses" means (subject to the third sentence of this
Section 7.4(c)) any and all damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) other than
amounts constituting consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages,
including loss of future revenue, income or profits, or any diminution of
value or multiple of earnings damages relating to the breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement (except as provided below or to the extent awarded and paid
to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim); provided, that
Indemnifiable Losses may include damages for (or calculated on the basis of)
lost profits or diminution of value to the extent that such lost profits or
diminution of value are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties and
are the direct and reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach or alleged
breach giving rise to the claim on which such Indemnifiable Losses are based
and can be proven with reasonable certainty; and provided further, that lost
profits or diminution of value with respect to the reduction or elimination of
any profits contemplated by the Milliman Report shall be determined by
application of the actuarial methodologies and approaches employed by Milliman
and reflected in the Milliman Report, discounted using a 12% discount rate, in
each case as of the date of the loss giving rise to the related claim. Any
such damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses shall be
net of any (i) amounts recovered by the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable
Losses for which such Indemnity Payment is made under any insurance policy,
reinsurance agreement, warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person
other than a party hereto, and the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnitor for any such amount that is received by it from any such other
Person with respect to an Indemnifiable Losses after any indemnification with
respect thereto has actually been paid pursuant to this Agreement less any
costs incurred in recovering such amount, (ii) amounts reserved for on the
Final Balance Sheet or otherwise included in the calculation of the Final
Closing Statutory Value, and (iii) Tax benefit deduction computed pursuant to
Section 7.3(b) (it being understood that no Indemnity Payment to be made
hereunder may be withheld or otherwise delayed due to the fact that an
expected Tax benefit has not actually been recognized by the applicable
Indemnitee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, as
respects any breach of the terms of, or misrepresentation with respect to,
Section 3.26 hereof (SSDMF Matters), "Indemnifiable Losses" will comprise only
fines, penalties, forfeitures, sanctions or other losses, liabilities or
obligations paid to Governmental Entities (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any related costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
the fees of other consultants)) to the extent resulting from or arising out of
any such breach or misrepresentation but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, policy benefits directly or indirectly required to be paid by virtue of
SSDMF matching protocols to policyholders or beneficiaries with respect to the
Insurance Contracts or, alternatively, directly or indirectly under the terms
of applicable escheat or similar requirements to any Governmental Entity
including, without limitation, related amounts of interest, whether determined
in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Contracts or otherwise under
Applicable Law;



59 

(d) "Indemnity Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable Losses required to
be paid pursuant to this Agreement; and

(e) "Third Party Claim" means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made or
brought by any Person that is not a party to this Agreement, (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Taxing Authority).



SECTION 7.5. Procedures for Third Party Claims.

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice thereof
(but in no event later than 30 days after becoming aware) and such notice
shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any documents relating
to the claim and, if reasonably practicable, an estimate of the Indemnifiable
Loss and shall reference the specific sections of this Agreement that form the
basis of such claim; provided, that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in
notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor is actually
prejudiced by such delay. Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five calendar days after the Indemnitee's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected by the Indemnitor. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not as long as it
conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof subsequent to the
date such defense is assumed. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor shall control such
defense. The Indemnitor shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period after the 10th Business
Day after the Indemnitee provides notice of a Third Party Claim to the
Indemnitor during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof
unless it is ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party
Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitor's request)
the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. If the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense of
a Third Party Claim within 10 Business Days after receipt by the Indemnitor of
notice thereof pursuant to Section 7.5(a), the Indemnitee shall be entitled,
in its reasonable discretion, to admit any liability with respect to, or pay,
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim; provided, however,
that if the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim
(including any such assumption that includes a reservation by the Indemnitor
of any or all of its rights under this Agreement and otherwise with respect to
such Third Party Claim, including its



60 right to contest the obligation to provide any indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim), the Indemnitee shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or pay, settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitor's prior written consent. If the
Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may
only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim with the
Indemnitee's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that the Indemnitor may pay,
settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes a release of the
Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does
not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy,
and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnitor submits to
the Indemnitee a bona fide settlement offer that satisfies the requirements
set forth in the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence and the
Indemnitee refuses to consent to such settlement, then thereafter the
Indemnitor's liability to the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party
Claim shall not exceed the Indemnitor's portion of the settlement amount
included in such settlement offer, and the Indemnitee shall either assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim or pay the Indemnitor's attorney's fees and
other out-of-pocket costs incurred thereafter in continuing the defense of
such Third Party Claim.

(c) Section 8.6, and not this Section 7.5, shall apply in the case of any
Third Party Claim, Tax Proceeding, or other proceeding relating to Taxes or a
liability for Taxes.



SECTION 7.6. Direct Claims. The Indemnitor will have a period of fifteen (15)
days within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on
account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such fifteen (15) day
period, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which
event the Indemnitee will be entitled to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnitee.



SECTION 7.7. Sole Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except as set forth in Section 2.5 (Post Closing Payments) and Section 10.7(b)
(Specific Performance), if the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy
following the Closing with respect to any and all claims arising out of this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article VII
(Indemnification) or Article VIII (Tax Matters); provided that, nothing
contained in this Article VII (Indemnification) or in Article VIII (Tax
Matters) shall alter or limit the rights and remedies of the parties under the
other Transaction Agreements, all of which rights and remedies shall be as set
forth in such other Transaction Agreements (but in no event may a party pursue
or recover duplicative losses under this Agreement and the relevant
Transaction Agreement); and provided further that nothing contained in this
Article VII (Indemnification) or in Article VIII (Taxes) shall alter or limit
the rights and remedies of the parties to pursue a common law claim for fraud
with specific intent to deceive.



SECTION 7.8. Certain Other Matters. Upon making any Indemnity Payment,
Indemnitor will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all
rights of Indemnitee against any third Person (other than any Taxing
Authority) in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment
related. Without limiting the generality or



61 effect of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor will
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above-described subrogation rights. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement for any liability to the
extent such liability, or the amount thereof, was the subject of a Dispute
Notice and resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in Section 2.5. In no event shall any Indemnitee (i) be entitled to
duplicate losses under two or more Transaction Agreements attributable to the
same underlying event giving rise to such loss or losses, or (ii) initiate
duplicate proceedings under two or more Transaction Agreements seeking
recovery for the same loss or losses.



SECTION 7.9. Certain Assurances.

(a) In the event that a Specified Event occurs at any time prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Limitation Period"), in order to secure
the payment and indemnification obligations of Buyer hereunder and under the
other Transaction Agreements, Buyer shall promptly (i) establish and maintain
a trust account (the "Trust Account") in force on commercially usual and
customary terms with a Qualified United States Financial Institution (the
"Trustee"), for the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates and at Buyer's sole
cost and expense and otherwise consistent with the provisions of this Section
7.9 and (ii) shall fund the Trust Account with Investment Assets having a
then-current statutory book value of not less than $37.5 million (the "Trust
Assets"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Trust Assets shall be subject
to a first priority security interest in favor of Seller and its Affiliates
and shall not be pledged, subjected to a Lien or otherwise hypothecated to or
for the benefit of any other Person.

(b) The Trust Assets will be managed by Buyer in accordance with the
Investment Guidelines.

(c) The Parties agree to work in good faith prior to the Closing to agree upon
the terms of the trust agreement governing the Trust Account and the Trust
Assets (the "Trust Agreement").

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that the assets maintained in the Trust Account may
be withdrawn by Seller only after a default by Buyer in the performance of its
monetary obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction Agreements, and
only if such default has not been cured by Buyer within ten (10) Business Days
following its receipt of a specific written notice thereof delivered by
Seller, and solely to the extent required to cure such default and,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, shall be utilized and
applied by Seller and its Affiliates or any successor thereof by operation of
law, including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or
conservator, without diminution because of insolvency on the part of Seller or
Buyer, only to pay amounts then due to Seller and its Affiliates under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. The amount of any such
withdrawal in excess of amounts then due hereunder and thereunder shall be
deemed maintained in an equitable or constructive trust for the benefit of
Buyer and promptly returned thereto.



62 

(e) Buyer will provide Seller with a written notice of the occurrence of any
Specified Event within five (5) days after the earliest of (i) the date on
which Buyer becomes aware of such Specified Event, (ii) the date on which
Buyer files a statutory financial statement with its domiciliary regulator
that reflects that a Specified Event has occurred or (iii) the date that is 45
days after the end of any calendar quarter in which a Specified Event occurs



ARTICLE VIII.

TAX MATTERS



SECTION 8.1. Indemnification for Taxes.

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons
from any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent arising out of the
following:

(i) any Taxes with respect to the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(including all Taxes attributable to the Restructuring), except:

a.to the extent any such Tax is attributable to an adjustment that results in
an increase in the taxable income of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and an equal or greater decrease in the taxable income of the Company
in a Post-Closing Tax Period; and

b.to the extent of any accrued liability for Taxes taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount;

(ii) any Tax Liability of any member of the Seller Group other than the
Company pursuant to any provision of joint and several liability under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (and any corresponding provision of
state, local, or foreign law;

(iii) any liability for Taxes, or any liability attributable to any Tax, for
which the Company may be liable, imposed on or attributable to any Person
other than the Company for or with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
portion thereof , as a transferee or successor or by contract (other than
contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to
commercial lending arrangements));

(iv) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.10(d), (f), (j), (l), (m), (n), (o) or (p) or Section 3.25 (without regard

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons
from and against (i) any and all liabilities for Taxes with respect to the
Company for all Post-Closing Tax Periods and (ii) Buyer's share of any
Conveyance Taxes under Section 8.5.



63 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in the following manner:

(i) in the case of Taxes based on or measured by income, gain, or receipts, or
related to the actual or deemed sale or transfer of property, or which are
withholding Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated based on an interim closing
of the books as of the day on which the Closing occurs (except that
exemptions, allowances, deductions or similar amounts that are calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be ratably
apportioned on a per diem basis); and

(ii) in the case of Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period.



SECTION 8.2. Filing of Tax Returns.

(a) (i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Consolidated Returns that include the Company, regardless of
when such Tax Returns are required to be filed.

(ii) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date and that are required to be filed prior to the Closing
Date (taking into account any extensions) other than Tax Returns described in
Section 8.2(a)(i) and shall provide Buyer with copies of such Tax Returns.

(iii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide
Seller and its Affiliates in a timely fashion in accordance with past practice
all filing information relating to the Company necessary for the preparation
and filing of the Consolidated Returns.

(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, Tax Returns for the Company for taxable periods that end on or before
the Closing Date that are not described in Section 8.2(a) and for any Straddle
Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
positions taken, and with accounting methods used, on the Tax Returns filed by
or with respect to the Company prior to the day on which the Closing occurs,
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or agreed by Seller and Buyer.
Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller for Seller's review at least
30 days (or, in the case of premium Tax Returns, 10 days) prior to the date
such Tax Return is required to be filed and shall (i) accept all comments of
Seller in respect of such Tax Returns for taxable periods that end on or
before the Closing Date and (ii) consider in good faith all comments of Seller
in respect of Tax Returns for Straddle Periods.

(c) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Company to prepare and
timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.



64 

(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, amend any Tax Returns of the Company relating in whole or in part
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.



SECTION 8.3. Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund, credit, or similar benefit
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) (a "Tax
Refund") relating to the Company for Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be the property of Seller except to the extent such Tax Refund was taken
into account in calculating the Final Adjustment Amount. If received by Buyer
or the Company, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay such Tax
Refund promptly to Seller, net of any Tax cost to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates attributable to the receipt of such refund. In the event that any
such Tax Refund is subsequently contested by any Tax authority, such contest
shall be handled in accordance with the procedures in Section 8.6. Any
additional Taxes resulting from the contest shall be indemnified in accordance
with Section 8.1.



SECTION 8.4. Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them or
their respective Affiliates may reasonably request of the other in filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for Tax Refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a Tax Refund, or participating in or
conducting any contest in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. Each party and
its Affiliates shall make its employees available on a basis mutually
convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for each Tax period first
ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax period to which
such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions
except to the extent notified in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods, or (ii) three years following the due date (without extension)
for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this Section 8.4 shall be
kept confidential except as otherwise may be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax Refunds or in conducting a contest or
as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange.



SECTION 8.5. Conveyance Taxes. Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall execute
and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the other to
comply with any filing requirements relating to any sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar Taxes ("Conveyance Taxes") which
become payable in connection with the purchase of Shares by Buyer and shall
file such applications and documents as shall permit any Conveyance Taxes to
be assessed and paid. Any Conveyance Taxes incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
shared equally by Seller and Buyer.



65 

SECTION 8.6. Tax Proceedings.

(a) Each party hereto shall provide the other with prompt notice of any Tax
adjustment proposed by a Taxing Authority or other claim that could give rise
to a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII (a "Tax Proceeding");
provided, that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect any right
to indemnification under this Article VIII except to the extent that the party
not receiving notice is prejudiced thereby. If the resolution of any Tax
Proceeding would be grounds for indemnification under this Article VIII by the
party not in control of the conduct of such Tax Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 8.6 (the "Non-Controlling Party"), (A) the party in control of such
Tax Proceeding (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-Controlling Party
fully informed of any proceedings, events and developments relating to or in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; (B) the Non-Controlling Party shall be
entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and documents relating to
such Tax Proceeding; and (C) at its own cost and expense, the Non-Controlling
Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the conduct of
such Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding any such control (i) Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Company to, enter into any settlement or admit any fault
or liability with respect to any Tax Proceeding that could give rise to a
claim for indemnification hereunder without the Seller's express written prior
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and (ii) Seller shall not enter into any settlement or admit any
fault or liability that is or purports to be binding on the Company for any
Tax period that could have any adverse effect on the liability of the Buyer or
the Company for Taxes for any period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, without Buyer's express written prior consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b) Seller shall have the sole right to control any Tax Proceeding relating to
taxable years or periods of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date.

(c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the parties shall jointly control any
Tax Proceedings, and neither party shall admit any fault or liability, or
settle or compromise any matter without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d) Buyer shall have the sole right to control any Tax Proceeding relating to
taxable years or periods of the Company beginning on or after the Closing
Date.



SECTION 8.7. Product Tax Claims.

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons may, within the applicable time period
specified in Section 7.1(a), but subject to Section 8.7(b)(ii), bring a claim
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) that relates to a breach of a representation
or warranty under Section 3.25 even if no related Third Party Claim has first
been asserted or made against Buyer or the Company with respect thereto (a
"Direct Product Tax Claim"); provided, however, that any Direct Product Tax
Claim must be based on the good faith determination by Buyer that a breach of
a representation or warranty under Section 3.25 has occurred. If any Buyer
Indemnified Person brings a Direct Product Tax Claim, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in good faith to determine whether any breach of a representation or
warranty under Section 3.25 has occurred and, if necessary, to



66 develop corrective measures that are appropriate, reasonable, cost-efficient
and effective, taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances
then applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to any breach of a representation or warranty under Section 3.25:

(i) Seller shall only be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons
for 80% of any Indemnifiable Loss resulting from or arising out of a breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.25;

(ii) Seller shall have no liability except to the extent that the relevant
representation or warranty was breached based on the facts that existed and
the Applicable Law (and interpretations thereof) as in effect as of or before
the Closing Date; and

(iii) Seller shall have no liability with respect to any insurance or annuity
policy or contract issued after the Closing Date.

(c) If, with respect to a Direct Product Tax Claim, Seller and Buyer cannot
agree as to whether a breach of a representation or warranty under Section
3.25 has occurred, then (i) if Seller promptly (and in any event within 30
Business Days) after receiving a written notice with respect to such Direct
Product Tax Claim delivers or causes to be delivered to Buyer an opinion
addressed to Buyer and issued by a reputable nationally recognized law firm,
accounting firm or actuarial firm that is familiar with analyzing matters of
the type covered by the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.25 and that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer to the effect that it is more
likely than not that no such breach has occurred with respect to the Direct
Product Tax Claim then in dispute, then Seller shall not be required to
indemnify Buyer with respect to such disputed Direct Product Tax Claim unless
and until either a Third Party Claim with respect thereto subsequently arises,
such opinion is subsequently withdrawn or qualified, the parties otherwise
agree that such opinion is no longer controlling or such opinion is not
subsequently reaffirmed or re-issued promptly upon the reasonable request of
Buyer (other than as a result of a change in Applicable Law) in which case (A)
Seller shall, as provided in Section 8.1(a)(iii) but subject to any applicable
limitations set forth in this Agreement (other than as specified below),
indemnify Buyer for any Indemnifiable Loss attributable to a breach of a
representation or warranty under Section 3.25 (including any penalties or fees
imposed by the IRS) resulting from or arising out of the matters set forth in
such disputed Direct Product Tax Claim, regardless of whether the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.25 shall have otherwise
expired pursuant to Section 7.1(a), and (ii) if Seller does not deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer any such opinion within such 30-Business Day
period, then such breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.25 that is alleged by Buyer shall be deemed conclusively to have been
established with respect to such Direct Product Tax Claim. If Seller and Buyer
cannot agree with respect to the appropriate, reasonable, cost efficient and
effective corrective measures, the disagreement shall be resolved by a
recognized law firm, accounting firm or actuarial firm selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller, and any such determination by such law firm,
accounting firm or actuarial firm shall be final. The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such law firm, accounting firm or
actuarial firm to render a determination within 60 days after the referral of
such matter for resolution. The fees and



67 expenses of such accounting firm, law firm or actuarial firm shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller.

(d) In the event that the corrective measures described in this Section 8.7
include making any request to the IRS for relief with respect to such failure,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly participate in all discussions or other
proceedings with the IRS, including attendance at meetings and joint approval
of all written submissions. Buyer shall control the decision of whether or not
to enter into a closing agreement or other arrangement with the IRS in
connection with such discussions or other proceedings; provided that if the
closing agreement or other arrangement involves any admission that would
reasonably be expected to form the basis of a claim against Seller under this
Agreement, then Buyer may not enter into any such closing agreement or other
arrangement without the consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall control the implementation of
the corrective measures described in this Section 8.7.



SECTION 8.8. Miscellaneous.

(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments (other than interest on a
payment) made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or the
other's Affiliates or the Company under this Article VIII and under other
indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof to
the extent permissible under Applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, as well as the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Persons, pursuant to this Article VIII shall terminate
on the later of 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or tollings
thereof) with respect to the Tax liabilities in question or 90 days after the
final administrative or judicial determination of such Tax liabilities, except
for any indemnity obligations as to which a claim has been made before the
expiration of the applicable 90-day period.

(c) Except for Sections 7.1(a), 7.3(b), 7.4 and 7.7, indemnification under
this Agreement for or with respect to any Taxes of the Company shall be
provided exclusively in this Article VIII and the provisions of Article VII
shall not apply.

(d) Should it be necessary, equitable adjustments will be made to prevent
duplicate recovery for indemnification with respect to the same item.

(e) Buyer shall not withhold any amounts pursuant to any Tax Law, provided,
that Seller has delivered or caused to be delivered to Buyer at or prior to
the Closing a certificate, in compliance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2), certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are
exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

(f) Seller shall cause all existing Tax Sharing Agreements to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company is bound to be terminated at and as
of the Closing Date with



68 regard to the Company in such a manner that the Company thereafter will have
no obligation to any Person under or with respect to such Tax Sharing
Agreements.

(g) Seller shall make, or cause to be made, a valid and timely election
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) and
1.1502-36(e)(5) to reduce the basis in the Shares to the maximum extent
required to prevent the Company from experiencing a reduction of Tax
attributes as described in Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-36(d)(4) and (5).
Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of such election within 30 days after
the filing of such election.



ARTICLE IX.

TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING



SECTION 9.1. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity that prohibits or restrains any party from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction
or decree shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a) shall have
performed in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement, acted
in good faith and, if binding on such party, used commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent the entry of, and to remove, such order, injunction or
decree in accordance with its obligations under this Agreement;

(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to September 2, 2014 (as it may be extended, the "Outside Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a material breach of this
Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided, that if
on the Outside Date either of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) or
Section 6.1(b) has not been satisfied then, upon the written notice of Seller
to Buyer, or Buyer to Seller, the Outside Date shall be extended to a date and
time that is not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 3,
2014;

(c) by either Seller or Buyer (but only so long as Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement)
in writing, if a breach of any provision of this Agreement that has been
committed by the other party would cause the failure of any mutual condition
to Closing or any condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-breaching
party and such breach is not capable of being cured or is not cured within 20
calendar days after the breaching party receives written notice from the non-
breaching party that the non-breaching party intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c); or

(d) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.



SECTION 9.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect without liability of either party (or any Representative of
such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided, that in the event
that this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section 9.1(c),
the non-breaching party shall be entitled to recover from the breaching party



69 reimbursement for up to $2,000,000 of its reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, no termination
of this Agreement shall relieve any party from any liability for any
intentional breach of this Agreement that occurs prior to such termination, in
which event the limitations on liability set forth in the foregoing proviso
will not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 1.1, Section 5.5, this
Section 9.2 and Article X shall survive termination hereof pursuant to Section
9.1. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, (i) Buyer shall
promptly return or destroy (with such destruction to be promptly confirmed in
writing to Seller) all documents received from Seller, its Affiliates and its
Representatives relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to Seller (except as provided
in the Confidentiality Agreement), and (ii) all confidential information
received by Buyer with respect to the Company shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

applicability of such fact or item to such other section of such Disclosure
Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Disclosure of

the case may be, shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material item, fact, exception of fact, event or circumstance or that
occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or effect related to such item
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to constitute
a Material Adverse Effect. The table of contents and headings contained in

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to

negotiated by the parties hereto and shall not be construed by any
Governmental Entity against either party by virtue of the fact that such party
was the drafting party.



SECTION 10.4. Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including all exhibits and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the

respect to the directors and officers referred to therein and (ii) Articles

interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by

consent of the other party, and any such assignment that is not consented to
shall be null and void; provided, that Buyer shall be permitted to assign its
rights under this Agreement to acquire the Shares to any Affiliate of Buyer;
provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any
obligation hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.



72 

SECTION 10.7. Jurisdiction; Enforcement.

to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the City of New York (each, a "New
York Court") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or determining any claim
arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that
such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper; provided,
that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the parties
hereto from removing any matter from one New York Court to another New York
Court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable
judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other
proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or
judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within
or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award
or judgment will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award
or judgment. Any process or other paper to be served in connection with any
action or proceeding under this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in
accordance with Section 10.2, constitute good, proper and sufficient service
thereof.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, this being in addition (subject
to the terms of this Agreement) to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any Action is brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall
allege, and each party hereto hereby waives any defense or counterclaim, that
there is an adequate remedy at law.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.7.



73 

SECTION 10.8. Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver.

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such provision or portion thereof
shall be stricken from this Agreement and such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any such
provision so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. If any provision or part thereof of this Agreement is stricken in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.8, then such stricken
provision shall be replaced, to extent possible, with a legal, enforceable and
valid provision that is as similar in tenor to the stricken provision as is
legally possible.

(b) This Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a
written instrument signed by each of Buyer and Seller.

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.



SECTION 10.9. Certain Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the other
Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of the Schedules
or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company), nor any
Representative of any of them, makes or has made, and Buyer has not relied on,
any inducement or promise to Buyer except as specifically made in this
Agreement or any representation or warranty to Buyer, oral or written, express
or implied, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. With respect
to any estimation, valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast (including the
Actuarial Reports or any other communication by or on behalf of Milliman),
Buyer acknowledges that: (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimations, valuations, appraisals, projections and forecasts; (ii)
it is familiar with such uncertainties; (iii) such estimations, valuations,
appraisals, projections and forecasts are not themselves and shall not be
deemed to be representations or warranties of Seller or any of its Affiliates;
and (iv) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, it shall have no
claim against any Person with respect to any such valuation, appraisal,
projection or forecast.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller makes
no express or implied representation or warranty hereby or otherwise under
this Agreement as to the future experience, success or profitability of the
Company's business, whether or not conducted in a manner similar to the manner
in which such business was conducted prior to the Closing, that the reserves
held by or on behalf of the Company or the assets supporting such reserves,
including to the extent any asset, liability, equity amount or other line item
set forth on any



74 financial statement would be affected thereby, have been or will be adequate
or sufficient for the purposes for which they were established.

(c) Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and
investigation into and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning the Company.



SECTION 10.10. No Offset. No party to this Agreement may offset any amount due
to the other party hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates against any
amount owed or alleged to be owed from such other party or its Affiliates
under any other Transaction Agreement without the written consent of such
other party.



SECTION 10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.

prescribed generally by the State of Illinois consistently applied. In lieu of
investment earnings with respect to any net settlements for periods prior to

2 Recapture Closing Date and with respect to the Recapture Payment Amount from

Trust Agreement") and Section 3.2 of the Reinsurance Agreement, as mutually
determined and agreed by Ceding Company and Reinsurer (the "Designated

as of the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month
immediately preceding the Recapture Effective Date.

(d)Ceding Company and Reinsurer shall jointly execute a written notice or
instruction as may be necessary to enable Ceding Company to withdraw cash,
cash equivalent or other investment securities from the Security Trust Account
to fund all or part of the Recapture Payment Amount on the Recapture Closing
Date. The unpaid portion of the Recapture Payment Amount remaining following
any such withdrawal, which shall be determined based on the Designated Value
of the assets withdrawn by Ceding Company, shall be paid to Ceding Company by
Reinsurer in the form of cash, cash-equivalent or other securities included in
the Designated Portfolio. Ceding Company shall, and hereby does, consent to
the release to Reinsurer of any amounts remaining in the Security Trust
Account after giving effect to such withdrawal.

(e)Not fewer than five (5) Business Days prior to the Recapture Closing Date,
Reinsurer shall provide a report to Ceding Company setting forth the estimated
calculation of the Recapture Payment Amount as of the close of business on the
last Business Day of the calendar month immediately preceding the Recapture
Closing Date, determined consistent with the provisions of Schedule A (the
"Estimated Recapture Payment Amount"). On the Recapture Closing Date,
Reinsurer shall transfer to Company assets from the Designated Portfolio
having an aggregate Designated Value equal to the Estimated Recapture Payment
Amount. Within thirty (30) calendar days following the Recapture Closing Date,
Reinsurer will provide a second report to Ceding Company setting forth a
proposal with respect to the final calculation of the Recapture Payment Amount
as of the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month
immediately preceding the Recapture Closing Date, determined consistent with
the provisions of Schedule A (the "Final Recapture Payment Amount"). If the
Estimated Recapture Payment Amount exceeds the Final Recapture Payment Amount,
as calculated in accordance with this Section 2.1, Ceding Company shall pay
Reinsurer the difference thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified in writing by Reinsurer to Ceding Company. If
the Final Recapture Payment Amount exceeds the Estimated Recapture Payment
Amount, as calculated in accordance with this Section 2.1, Reinsurer shall pay
Ceding Company the difference thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by Ceding Company to
Reinsurer. Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.1(e)
shall be made together with interest thereon accrued from the Recapture
Closing Date to (but not including) the date of payment at an annual rate
equal to 5%.



3 

(f)If Ceding Company disagrees with the Final Recapture Payment Amount, Ceding
Company may, within ten (10) Business Days following its receipt of the report
setting forth the calculation thereof, deliver a notice to Reinsurer setting
forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and the basis for
Ceding Company's disagreement therewith (the "Dispute Notice"). If no Dispute
Notice is received by Reinsurer on or prior to such date, the Final Recapture
Payment Amount shall be deemed acceptable by Ceding Company and final and
binding on the Parties. If a Dispute Notice is received by Reinsurer, the
dispute will be resolved by application mutatis mutandis of procedures set
forth in clauses (iv) through (viii) of Section 2.5 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement with respect to the determination of the Final Recapture Payment
Amount.



Section 2.2 Ceding Company Release of Reinsurer. In consideration of the
recapture and final settlement hereunder and the release provided in Section
2.3, as of the date the Estimated Recapture Payment Amount is received by
Ceding Company but effective as of the Recapture Effective Time, Ceding
Company hereby forever releases and discharges Reinsurer, and its

Article II

Reinsurance of the Insurance Policies



Section 2.1 Scope of Reinsurance. This Reinsurance Agreement applies to all
Reinsured Liabilities based upon, relating to or arising from the insurance
contracts, plans and policies (including all related binders, slips,
certificates, applications therefor, supplements, endorsements, riders and
agreements) issued or assumed prior to the Effective Date in connection with
the Ceding Company's accident and health, specified disease and other health
insurance coverages, but excluding the Excluded Health Business, and that were
in effect at any time prior to, on or after the Effective Date including, but
without limitation, the insurance contracts, plans and policies, and the
related binders, slips, certificates, applications therefor, supplements,
endorsements, riders and agreements, and other items set forth on Schedule 2.1
(such insurance contracts, whether or not set forth on Schedule 2.1, the
"Insurance Policies"). The Parties intend that, taken together but excluding
the Excluded Health Business, the Insurance Policies constitute all of the
accident and health, specified disease and other health insurance coverages
and risks, direct written or reinsured, that were issued or assumed prior to
the Effective Date but were in effect at any time prior to, on or after the
Effective Date and expressly agree that, as distinct from the Company's life
insurance, annuity and other business lines, this reinsurance will result in
the transfer to Reinsurer of all risks and obligations associated with the
Ceding Company's entire portfolio of accident and health, specified disease
and other health insurance coverages, except for the Excluded Health Business
which shall remain a liability and obligation of Ceding Company, as of the
Effective Date. The Parties agree to reasonably cooperate to make appropriate
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
balances settled hereunder, in the event that the scope of reinsurance set
forth in this Section 2.1 is determined at any time to be inconsistent with
the foregoing intentions and agreements of the Parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the term "Insurance Policies"
excludes insurance policies reinsured under the CLIC - WNIC Modified
Coinsurance Agreement.



Section 2.2 Amount of Reinsurance.

(a)Subject to the satisfaction of each of the Closing Conditions, Ceding
Company hereby cedes to Reinsurer, on a coinsurance basis, and Reinsurer
hereby accepts and agrees to reinsure, as of the Effective Date, the Ceded
Percentage of the Reinsured Liabilities arising prior to, on or after the
Effective Date. Reinsurer shall remain liable as Reinsurer for all Reinsured
Liabilities reinsured under this Reinsurance Agreement until the earlier of
(i) such time as Ceding Company no longer has any Reinsured Liabilities, or
(ii) the date this Reinsurance Agreement is terminated in accordance with the
provisions of Article VIII hereof. The liability of Reinsurer under this
Reinsurance Agreement shall (x) follow and be identical to the liability of
Ceding Company in respect of the Reinsured Liabilities, and (y) remain in full
force and effect without regard to the collectability of reinsurance under any
of the Inuring Reinsurance Agreements. For purposes of the foregoing, the term
"Closing Conditions" means, taken together, (1) completion of the SPA Closing
(2) receipt of any and all approvals, consents or waivers required under
Applicable Law to be provided by any Governmental Entity in order for the
reinsurance contemplated hereby to be or become effective.



5 (b)Reinsurer shall pay the Ceded Percentage of all contractual benefits and
other liabilities that Ceding Company owes in connection with the Reinsured
Liabilities on or after the Effective Date, whether the amount of such
benefits and other liabilities is fixed by settlement, judgment, arbitration
or otherwise.

(c)In addition to the Reinsured Liabilities, Reinsurer hereby assumes and
accepts, and agrees to discharge and pay in full, the Ceded Percentage of all
Extra Contractual Obligations.



Section 2.3 Payments to Reinsurer. In consideration of the reinsurance
provided hereunder, Ceding Company shall pay to Reinsurer the following:

(a)On the date hereof, cash and/or the mutually agreed-upon admitted invested
assets on Schedule 2.3(a)(i) having a fair market value equal to the Ceded
Percentage of the statutory reserves that Ceding Company maintained (or, if a
lesser amount, was required to maintain) on the Insurance Policies as of the
Effective Date (giving credit for reinsurance ceded under the Inuring
Reinsurance Agreements) (as shown on Schedule 2.3(a)(ii));

(b)On and after the date hereof, the Ceded Percentage of gross premium (as
adjusted for reinsurance ceded under the Inuring Reinsurance Agreements)
collected in connection with the Insurance Policies subsequent to the
Effective Date; and

(c)On and after the date hereof, any amounts collected under Inuring
Reinsurance Agreements subsequent to the Effective Date.



Section 2.4 Negative Ceding Commission. In consideration of the reinsurance
ceded hereunder, on the date hereof, Ceding Company shall pay to Reinsurer a
negative ceding commission in cash equal to [Six Hundred Thousand] Dollars
($[600,000]).



Section 2.5 No Privity. The Parties agree that no rights or legal duties shall
arise, by virtue of the reinsurance provided under this Reinsurance Agreement,
between Reinsurer and any policyholder insured by Ceding Company. Reinsurer's
liability is to Ceding Company as provided under the terms of this Reinsurance
Agreement.



Section 2.6 Inuring Reinsurance.

(a) Ceding Company agrees to cooperate with Reinsurer as Reinsurer deems
reasonably necessary to effect the collection of reinsurance pursuant to the
Inuring Reinsurance Agreements, including, without limitation, subrogation of
Reinsurer to Ceding Company's rights under the Insuring Reinsurance Agreements
or in seeking assignments or novations thereof, provided that such cooperation
shall not require Ceding Company to incur material costs or expenses not
reimbursed by Reinsurer or expose Ceding Company to additional risk or
exposure in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Reinsurance
Agreement.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Reinsurer, Ceding Company may not
amend or revise the terms of, or recapture or terminate, the Inuring
Reinsurance Agreements. Upon a recapture of risks reinsured under any Inuring
Reinsurance Agreement where Reinsurer's consent is given, liabilities
recaptured by Ceding Company with respect to the Insurance Policies



6 will be reinsured by Reinsurer hereunder in accordance with and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Reinsurance Agreement.

Article III

Policy Administration and Related Matters



Section 3.1 Administration.

(a)In consideration for the payments by Ceding Company to Reinsurer pursuant
to Section 2.3, the Parties agree that, on and after the Effective Date,
Reinsurer shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for the
administration in full of the Insurance Policies. Reinsurer shall provide such
administrative services in a professional and competent manner, in good faith
and with not less than the same standard and level of care with which
Reinsurer administers its other insurance businesses. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Insurance Policies shall be administered in
conformance with Applicable Law, including maintenance by Reinsurer of all
licenses and permits necessary to perform the services, and industry standards
and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policies and this
Reinsurance Agreement. Ceding Company hereby delegates to Reinsurer all
authority necessary to enable Reinsurer to administer the Insurance Policies,
including by providing such instruments, powers, confirmations and documents

perform all necessary administrative services in accordance with this
Reinsurance Agreement and Applicable Law.

(b)Ceding Company shall promptly forward to Reinsurer all notices,

Percentage of the Reinsured Liabilities.

(b)All monies, checks, drafts, money orders, postal notes and other

checks, drafts, money orders and other instruments pertaining to the Insurance

by Reinsurer under this Reinsurance Agreement.

(c)Ceding Company shall reimburse Reinsurer in cash for the amount of guaranty
association or other assessments paid by Reinsurer on or after the Effective
Date on account of the Insurance Policies, but only to the extent such
payments actually reduce Ceding Company's premium tax or state income tax
liabilities. Any such payments shall be settled pursuant to the accounting and
settlement procedures described in Section 3.4.



7 Section 3.3 Bank Accounts.

(a)Reinsurer is hereby authorized by Ceding Company to maintain bank accounts
with banking institutions to provide the administrative services for the
Insurance Policies. Reinsurer shall have the exclusive authority to (i)
designate the authorized signatories on the bank accounts, (ii) issue drafts
on and make deposits in the bank accounts in the name of, and as administrator
for, Ceding Company, (iii) make withdrawals from the bank accounts and (iv)
engage in all other transactions with respect to the bank accounts as may be
reasonably necessary to provide the administrative services in accordance with
this Reinsurance Agreement and Applicable Law.

(b)Ceding Company agrees to cooperate with Reinsurer to take such steps

timely manner all financial reports required to be filed under statutory and
GAAP accounting methods, in order to comply with its Tax obligations and
otherwise as may be required to respond timely to a request for information

tender) or its equivalent. Any amount due and unpaid under this Reinsurance
Agreement shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to five percent (5%).

Agreement is unintentional and caused by misunderstanding or oversight, the
Parties shall adjust the situation to what it would have been had the
misunderstanding or oversight not occurred, and the reinsurance provided
hereunder shall not be invalidated. The Party first discovering such
misunderstanding or oversight shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing, and the Parties shall act to correct such misunderstanding or
oversight promptly following receipt of such notice.



8

Article IV

Credit for Reinsurance



Ceding Company and Reinsurer shall establish and maintain proper reserves
(including for unearned premium, claims, incurred but not reported claims and
other reserves) for the Insurance Policies in accordance with statutory
accounting principles promulgated by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners and the requirements of the laws of Ceding Company's state of
domicile. Reinsurer shall take such steps as may be required for Ceding
Company to receive full credit on Ceding Company's statutory financial
statements for the reinsurance ceded under this Reinsurance Agreement.



Article V

Regulatory Matters and Requirements; Litigation



Section 5.1 Cooperation.

(a)The Parties shall cooperate with each other in complying with regulatory
requirements and responding to regulatory inquiries associated with the
Insurance Policies or this Reinsurance Agreement. The duty of cooperation
provided for in this Section 5.1 shall extend to any and all litigation
matters regarding the Reinsured Liabilities or the Insurance Policies,
including litigation involving third parties and the matters set forth on
Schedule 1.2.

(b)Without in any way limiting the foregoing (a), except as (i) otherwise
provided in this Section, or (ii) as required under Applicable Law to be
performed by Ceding Company directly without delegation, Reinsurer, on behalf
of Ceding Company, shall be responsible for compliance with regulatory
requirements and the taking of all required actions with respect to any
examination or Action initiated by Governmental Entities relating to the
Insurance Policies (the "Regulatory Action"). Reinsurer shall respond to,
supervise and use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all
Regulatory Actions in a competent and effective manner; provided, however,
that any response regarding any such Regulatory Action that is directed to or
otherwise involves Ceding Company or any of its Affiliates shall be subject to
Ceding Company's prior review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). If Ceding Company or Reinsurer receives
notice of, or otherwise becomes aware of any inquiry, investigation,
examination, audit or proceeding by Governmental Entity relating to the
Insurance Policies, Ceding Company or Reinsurer, as applicable, shall promptly
notify the other Party thereof. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve regulatory matters in a mutually satisfactory manner and shall act
reasonably in light of the Parties' respective interests in the matter at
issue. With respect to any regulatory or Tax-related filings required to be
made by Ceding Company with respect to the Insurance Policies, the Parties
shall cooperate, and Reinsurer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide all information reasonably required by Ceding Company sufficiently in
advance of the filing based on the nature of any such information and any such
filings in order for Ceding Company to timely effect such filings.



9 

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
limiting or waiving any right to indemnification or payment that it may have
under the terms of this Agreement or the SPA, Ceding Company shall have the
right to engage its own separate legal representation, at its own cost and
expense, and to participate fully in, but not control, the defense of (i) any
Action (other than as described in clause (ii) below) relating to the
Insurance Policies with respect to which Ceding Company is a named party to
the extent that such Action, if successful, could (in Ceding Company's
reasonable opinion) materially interfere with the business, assets,
liabilities, obligations, financial condition, results of operations or
reputation of Ceding Company or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) any Action
relating to a class action or lawsuit that involves both the Insurance
Policies and other policies of Ceding Company with respect to which Ceding
Company is a named party. In any such case, Ceding Company may propose terms
on which it will assume control of the defense of such Action and Reinsurer
will in good faith cooperate with Ceding Company to agree on the terms under
which Ceding Company shall assume control of such Action while preserving
Reinsurer's commercial interests with respect thereto and not exposing
Reinsurer to the prospect of material additional loss, cost, expense or risk
(financial, operational, regulatory or otherwise).

(d)With respect to any action required to be taken by Ceding Company without
delegation, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to ensure that Ceding
Company complies with all Applicable Law.

(e)Without in any way limiting the foregoing, Reinsurer shall fully indemnify
Ceding Company as to all liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses arising
out of the Pending Proceedings.

Section 5.2 Insolvency. Reinsurance provided under this Reinsurance Agreement
shall be payable by Reinsurer on the basis of Ceding Company's liability under
the Insurance Policies without diminution because of any insolvency of Ceding
Company. Reinsurer shall pay its share of Ceding Company's liability directly
to Ceding Company or its liquidators, receivers or statutory successors. The
liquidators, receivers or statutory successors shall give written notice to
Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against Ceding Company involving an
Insurance Policy reinsured under this Reinsurance Agreement within a
reasonable time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding. During
the pendency of such claim, Reinsurer may investigate the claim and interpose,
at its own expense, in the proceeding where the claim is to be adjudicated,
any defense or defenses which it may deem available to Ceding Company or
Ceding Company's liquidators, receivers or statutory successors. Any expense
Reinsurer thus incurs shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, to
Ceding Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of the
proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Ceding Company solely
from the defense undertaken by Reinsurer. In the event two or more assuming
Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority-in-interest elect to
interpose a defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in
accordance with the terms of this Reinsurance Agreement as though such
expenses had been incurred by Ceding Company.



Section 5.3 Ceding Company Indemnification. Ceding Company hereby indemnifies
and holds Reinsurer harmless from and against all loss, damage, cost and
expense of any nature, including legal, accounting and other professional fees
(collectively, "Losses"), arising from (i) any liability relating to the
Insurance Policies that results from Ceding



10 Company's acts, errors or omissions that occur on or after the Effective Date
(excluding, for this purpose, any acts, errors or omissions of Ceding Company
that occur or fail to occur as a result of Ceding Company following
instructions or directives by or on behalf of Reinsurer), or (ii) any
violation or breach of this Reinsurance Agreement by Ceding Company.



Section 5.4 Reinsurer Indemnification. Reinsurer hereby indemnifies and holds
Ceding Company harmless from and against all Losses arising from or relating
to (i) the Reinsured Liabilities, (ii) the Extra Contractual Obligations, or
(iii) any violation or breach of this Reinsurance Agreement by Reinsurer.

Article IX

Miscellaneous Provisions



Section 9.1 Arbitration.

(a)Any dispute or other matter in question between Reinsurer and Ceding
Company arising out of, or relating to, the formation, interpretation,
performance, or breach of this Reinsurance Agreement, whether such dispute
arises before or after termination of this Reinsurance Agreement, and whether
in contract or in tort, shall be settled by arbitration.

(b)Reinsurer and Ceding Company agree that, prior to resorting to arbitration,
they shall negotiate diligently and in utmost good faith, in an effort to
resolve any dispute. Once a Party notifies the other of a dispute and invokes
this paragraph, the Parties shall have sixty (60) days (or such longer period
as they may agree) within which to negotiate a resolution. At the end of sixty
(60) days, either Party may initiate arbitration.

(c)To initiate arbitration, either Reinsurer or Ceding Company shall notify
the other Party in writing of its desire to arbitrate. The notice shall
identify the claimant and the contract at issue, if applicable, and the nature
of the claims and/or issues. Notice shall be sent via certified mail, with
return receipt, or another service which produces a receipt. The arbitration
will be deemed to have been commenced on the date the notice of arbitration is
received.

(d)There shall be three (3) arbitrators who each shall have no less than ten
(10) years of industry experience and who are (i) current or former officers
of life or health insurance or life or health reinsurance companies, or (ii)
professionals with no less than twenty (20) years of experience in or serving
the life or health insurance or reinsurance industries other than the Parties
to this Reinsurance Agreement, their Affiliates or subsidiaries. The
arbitrators shall be disinterested and shall not be under the control of any
party to the arbitration, nor shall any member of the panel have a financial
interest in the outcome of the dispute.

(e)Within thirty (30) days following the commencement of the arbitration
proceedings, each Party shall provide the other with the identification of
their appointed arbitrator, and provide a copy of the arbitrator's curriculum
vitae. If either Party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within
thirty (30) days, the other Party may appoint the second arbitrator to act as
the appointed arbitrator for the defaulting party. The Parties' appointed
arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator (the "Umpire"). Each
Party may consult, in confidence, with the arbitrator they appointed
concerning the appointment of an Umpire. If the two (2) Party-appointed
arbitrators fail to reach agreement on an Umpire within sixty (60) days of
their appointment, each Party shall exchange, within seven (7) days
thereafter, six (6) names of qualified individuals. Each Party shall select
three (3) names from the list and notify the other Party as to its selection.
Each Party shall rank the six (6) candidates in order of preference, and the
individual with the lowest total numerical ranking will act as Umpire. If the
ranking results in a tie, the Parties shall draw lots from the tied
individuals, and the individual chosen by lot shall act as Umpire. If either
Party fails to act in utmost good faith within a reasonable period of time to
complete these procedures, the non-defaulting Party shall appoint the Umpire
from its original candidate pool. Neither Party nor their respective
representatives shall inform the Umpire which Party initiated his or her
selection.



13 

(f)In the event any arbitrator fails, refuses, or becomes unable to act as
such before an award has been rendered, a successor shall be selected in the
same manner as the original arbitrator.

(g) The claimant and respondent each shall submit initial briefs to the panel
outlining the issues in dispute and the reasons for their respective positions
within thirty (30) days of the notice of the appointment of the Umpire.

(h)Insofar as not in conflict with the express terms of this Reinsurance
Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that customs and practices of
the life and health insurance and reinsurance industries may be considered by
the arbitrators in resolving any ambiguities inherent in this Reinsurance
Agreement or its operation. In the absence of any such ambiguity, the express
terms of this Reinsurance Agreement shall control.

(i)The arbitrators shall decide all substantive and procedural issues by a
majority of votes. As soon as possible, the arbitrators shall establish
arbitration procedures as warranted by the facts and issues of the particular
case. Except as provided specifically in this Article, the arbitrators shall
have the power to determine all procedural rules of the arbitration,
including, but not limited to inspection of documents, examination of
witnesses, and any other matter related to the conduct of the arbitration.
Each Party may examine the witnesses who testify at the arbitration hearing.
Each Party shall have right to be represented by legal counsel. The arbitrator
shall not be obligated to follow judicial formalities or the rules of evidence
except to the extent required by Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the panel and the Umpire shall have the authority to issue
subpoenas (including subpoenas to third party witnesses) and other orders to
enforce their decisions. Ex parte communications with Party-appointed
arbitrators shall be permitted until the arbitration hearing commences.

(j)The arbitrators shall recognize the attorney/client privilege and neither a
Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or result of any
arbitration hereunder, except to the extent such disclosure may be required
for review and enforcement by a court of competent jurisdiction, independent
accounting audit, to support reinsurance or retrocessional recoveries, or is
otherwise agreed to by the Parties. Any third party receiving confidential
information must agree to maintain confidentiality before disclosure shall be
permitted.

(k) The location of all proceedings shall be determined by the arbitrators.

(l)The panel may issue orders for interim relief upon showing of good cause,
including pre-award security. Absent good cause for an extension as determined
by the panel, the panel shall render the award within thirty (30) days after
the date of the closing of the hearing, or if an arbitration hearing has been
waived or otherwise dispensed with, within thirty (30) days after the date
that the panel received all materials submitted by the Parties for
disposition. The panel is authorized to award any remedy or sanctions allowed
by Applicable Law, including, but not limited to monetary damages, equitable
relief, pre- or post-award interest, costs of arbitration, attorneys' fees,
and other final or interim relief. Arbitrators shall not be empowered to award
damages in excess of compensatory damages, and each party irrevocably waives
any damages in excess of compensatory damages.



14 

(m)The decision of the arbitrators shall be made by majority rule, and shall
be final and binding on both Parties. There shall be no appeal from the
decision, except that the Parties retain all rights to challenge under the
Federal Arbitration Act. Either Party to the arbitration may petition any
court having jurisdiction over the parties to reduce the decision to judgment.

(n)Unless the arbitrators decide otherwise, each Party shall bear the expense
of its own arbitration activities, including its appointed arbitrator and any
outside attorney and witness fees. The Parties shall jointly and equally bear
the expense of the Umpire and other costs of the arbitration.



Section 9.2 Assignment and Delegation. This Reinsurance Agreement may not be
assigned (whether by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise), and the duties
and obligations hereunder may not be delegated, by any Party unless such
assignment or delegation is agreed to in advance in writing by both Parties
hereto, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. This Reinsurance Agreement shall be binding on the Parties, their
permitted assignees, delegees and successors (including, without limitation,
any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of a Party).



Section 9.3 Confidentiality. The Parties shall comply with all applicable
state and federal privacy laws and requirements. In addition, each Party (i)
shall keep the business, policy and other records of the other Party
confidential, (ii) shall not disclose or reveal such records to anyone and
(iii) shall not use the records for any purpose whatsoever, other than
performing its responsibilities under this Reinsurance Agreement, unless (iv)
the Party is legally required to disclose or reveal the information contained
in such records. In that event, the information shall be disclosed only to the
extent legally required and only after giving ten (10) calendar days' prior
notice to the other Party.



Section 9.4 Construction. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Reinsurance Agreement are provided for convenience only and shall not affect
its construction or interpretation. All references to "Articles" and

Reinsurance Agreement. All words used in this Reinsurance Agreement shall be

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of
this Reinsurance Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of

electronic transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of

original agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by

original signatures for all purposes.

Article II

Reinsurance of SHIP Health Insurance Policies



Section 2.1 Scope of Reinsurance. This Agreement applies to all Reinsured
Liabilities based upon, relating to or arising from the insurance contracts,
plans and policies (including all related binders, slips, certificates,
applications therefor, supplements, endorsements, riders and agreements)
issued or assumed in connection with the Ceding Company's specified disease,
Medicare Supplement and other health insurance coverages of any kind that were
in effect at any time prior to, on or after the Effective Date and transferred
to and assumed by Ceding Company under the SHIP Assignment Agreement,
including, but without limitation, the insurance contracts, plans and
policies, and the related binders, slips, certificates, applications therefor,
supplements, endorsements, riders and agreements, and other items set forth on
Schedule 2.1 (such insurance contracts, whether or not set forth on Schedule
2.1, the "SHIP Health Insurance Policies"). The Parties agree to reasonably
cooperate to make appropriate adjustments to the terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the balances settled hereunder, in the event
that the scope of reinsurance set forth in this Section 2.1 is determined at
any time to be inconsistent with the foregoing intentions and agreements of
the Parties.



Section 2.2 Amount of Reinsurance.

(a)Subject to the satisfaction of each of the Closing Conditions, Ceding
Company hereby cedes to Reinsurer, on a modified coinsurance basis, and
Reinsurer hereby accepts and agrees to reinsure, as of the Effective Date, the
Ceded Percentage of the Reinsured Liabilities arising prior to, on or after
the Effective Date. Reinsurer shall remain liable as Reinsurer for all
Reinsured Liabilities reinsured under this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
such time as Ceding Company no longer has liability under the SHIP Health
Insurance Policies or (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with the provisions of Article VIII hereof. The liability of Reinsurer under
this Agreement shall (x) follow and be identical to the liability of Ceding
Company in respect of the Reinsured Liabilities, and (y) remain in full force
and effect without regard to the collectability of reinsurance under any Other
Reinsurance Agreements. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Closing
Conditions" means, taken together, (1) completion of the SPA Closing and (2)
receipt of any and all approvals, consents or waivers required under
Applicable Law to be provided by any Governmental Entity in order for the
reinsurance contemplated hereby to be or become effective.

(b)Reinsurer shall pay the Ceded Percentage of all contractual benefits and
other liabilities that Ceding Company owes in connection with the Reinsured
Liabilities on or after the Effective Date, whether the amount of such
benefits and other liabilities is fixed by settlement, judgment, arbitration
or otherwise.

(c)The reinsurance hereunder shall be on a modified coinsurance basis whereby
Ceding Company shall (i) establish and maintain the Modco Reserve and (ii)
retain ownership of all assets supporting the Modco Reserve (such assets to
remain in the SHIP Trust unless otherwise mutually agreed among the Parties
and SHIP).

(d)In addition to the Reinsured Liabilities, Reinsurer hereby assumes and
accepts, and agrees to discharge and pay in full, the Ceding Percentage of (i)
all Extra



7 Contractual Obligations and (ii) to the extent relating to the SHIP Health
Insurance Policies, all Residual SHIP Obligations.



Section 2.3 Net Settlement.

(a)For each Quarterly Accounting Period, the Parties will effect a settlement
on a net basis (the "Net Settlement") as contemplated by Schedule 2.3. The Net
Settlement shall account for (i) premiums collected each calendar quarter,
(ii) claims or settlements for any benefits paid, (iii) commissions paid, (iv)
administrative expenses and (v) the Modco Reserve Adjustment.

(b)Ceding Company shall provide Reinsurer with all information in its
possession necessary to prepare the Net Settlement determinations in
accordance with Schedule 2.3 no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the end of such Quarterly Accounting Period. Reinsurer shall then provide
Ceding Company with reports detailing the Net Settlement determinations by the
later of (i) the tenth (10th) Business Day after receipt from Ceding Company
of the information described in the immediately preceding sentence or (ii) the
twentieth (20th) Business after the end of such Quarterly Accounting Period.

(c)If a Net Settlement report reflects a balance due a Party, the amount(s)
shown as due shall be paid by the other Party within ten (10) Business Days of
the delivery of the report. Any dispute over any amount shown on a Net
Settlement report that cannot be amicably resolved by the Parties shall be
resolved by the procedures set forth in Section 9.1.

(d)If there is a delayed settlement of any payment due hereunder, interest
will accrue at an annual rate equal to five percent (5%). For the purposes of
this Section, a payment will be considered overdue, and such interest will
begin to accrue, on the date which is ten (10) Business Days after the date
such payment is due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that
payments to be made to Reinsurer hereunder shall be funded by corresponding
withdrawals and releases of funds maintained in the SHIP Trust and Ceding
Company shall not be required to advance any funds independently from its own
account in respect of payment to be made to Reinsurer hereunder. If, without a
breach by Ceding Company of its obligations hereunder, a delayed settlement
under the terms of this Agreement is attributable in whole or in part to a
delay in the effectiveness of any related withdrawal from the SHIP Trust, then
such delayed payment will not be considered overdue and shall not constitute a
breach by Ceding Company of its obligations hereunder and interest will not
begin to accrue, until the fourth (4th) Business Day after the corresponding
withdrawal from the SHIP Trust is received by Ceding Company.



Section 2.4 Ceding Commission. In consideration of the reinsurance ceded
hereunder, on the date of the SPA Closing, Reinsurer shall pay to Ceding
Company a ceding commission equal to [Eighteen Million Six Hundred Thousand]
Dollars ($[18,600,000]).



Section 2.5 Other Payments and Transfers. Subject to payments by Ceding
Company to Reinsurer after the Effective Date pursuant to Section 2.3, Ceding
Company is not obligated to pay or transfer any amounts to Reinsurer on the
date of the SPA Closing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payments
or transfers constituting Transferred Assets under the SHIP Assignment
Agreement.



8 

Section 2.6 No Privity. The Parties agree that no rights or legal duties shall
arise, by virtue of the reinsurance provided under this Agreement, between
Reinsurer on the one hand and SHIP or any policyholder insured by Ceding
Company on the other hand. Reinsurer's liability is to Ceding Company as
provided under the terms of this Agreement.



Section 2.7 Other Reinsurance Agreements.

(a)Except for this Agreement, Other Reinsurance Agreements shall inure to the
sole and exclusive benefit and cost of Reinsurer. For the avoidance of doubt,
the collectability of any such reinsurance or other amounts associated with
the Other Reinsurance Agreements shall be at the risk and for the account of
Reinsurer. Ceding Company shall reasonably cooperate with Reinsurer as may be
necessary to enable Reinsurer to pursue any management and collection efforts
related to the Other Reinsurance Agreements, provided, however, that such
cooperation shall not require Ceding Company to incur material costs and
expenses not reimbursed by Reinsurer or expose Ceding Company to additional
risk or exposure in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b)Without the prior written consent of Reinsurer, Ceding Company may not (i)
amend or revise the terms of, or recapture or terminate, the Other Reinsurance
Agreements or any assumed reinsurance, or (ii) further reinsure, directly or
indirectly, on any basis the SHIP Health Insurance Policies. Upon a recapture
of risks reinsured under any Other Reinsurance Agreements where Reinsurer's
consent is given, liabilities recaptured by Ceding Company with respect to
SHIP Health Insurance Policies will be reinsured by Reinsurer hereunder in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



Section 2.8 Certain Transactions. At the request of either Ceding Company or
Reinsurer, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to seek, (i) with respect to
the Other Reinsurance Agreements, assignments, novations, cut-through
arrangements, commutations or comparable transactions on commercially
acceptable terms, or (ii) with respect to the SHIP Assignment Agreement,
elimination of the SHIP Trust requirement and termination of the SHIP Trust
and SHIP Trust Agreement.



Article III

Administration and Related Matters



Section 3.1 Delegation of Administration.

(a)In consideration for the payments by Ceding Company to Reinsurer pursuant
to Section 2.3, on and after the Effective Date, Reinsurer shall be
responsible at its sole cost and expense for the administration in full of the
SHIP Health Insurance Policies and the Other Reinsurance Agreements. Reinsurer
shall provide such administrative services in a professional and competent
manner, in good faith and with not less than the same standard and level of
care with which Reinsurer administers its other insurance businesses. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the SHIP Health Insurance Policies
shall be administered in conformance with Applicable Law, including
maintenance by Reinsurer of all permits and licenses necessary to perform the
services, and industry standards and pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the SHIP Health Insurance Policies and this Agreement. Ceding Company hereby



9 delegates to Reinsurer all authority necessary to enable Reinsurer to
administer the SHIP Health Insurance Policies, including by providing such
instruments, powers, confirmations and documents on customary terms and
conditions to act in the name and place of Ceding Company as may reasonably be
requested by Reinsurer to enable Reinsurer to perform all necessary
administrative services in accordance with this Agreement and Applicable Law.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that Ceding Company's delegation of administrative responsibility

Agreement or the SHIP Trust Agreement, including litigation involving third
parties.

performed by Ceding Company directly without delegation, Reinsurer, on behalf
of Ceding Company, shall be responsible for compliance with regulatory
requirements and the taking of all required actions with respect to any
examination or Action initiated by Governmental Entities relating to the SHIP
Health Insurance Policies, the SHIP Assignment Agreement or the SHIP Trust
Agreement

commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all Regulatory Actions in a
competent and effective manner; provided, however, that any response regarding
any such Regulatory Action that is directed to or otherwise involves Ceding
Company or any of its Affiliates shall be subject to Ceding Company's prior
review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). If Ceding Company or Reinsurer receives notice of, or otherwise
becomes aware of, any inquiry, investigation, examination, audit or proceeding
by Governmental Entity, relating to the SHIP Health Insurance Policies, the
SHIP Assignment Agreement or the SHIP Trust Agreement, Ceding Company or
Reinsurer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other Party thereof. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve regulatory matters in a
mutually satisfactory manner and shall act reasonably in light of the Parties'
respective interests in the matter at issue. With respect to any regulatory or
Tax-related filings required to be made by Ceding Company with respect to the
SHIP Health Insurance Policies, the SHIP Assignment Agreement or the SHIP
Trust Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate, and Reinsurer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all information reasonably required
by Ceding Company sufficiently in advance of the filing based on the nature of
any such information and any such filings in order for Ceding Company to
timely effect such filings.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, without
limiting or waiving any right to indemnification or payment that it may have
under the terms of this Agreement or the SPA, Ceding Company shall have the
right to engage its own separate legal representation, at its own cost and
expense, and to participate fully in, but not control, the defense of (i) any
Action (other than as described in clause (ii) below) relating to the SHIP
Health Insurance Policies, the SHIP Assignment Agreement or the SHIP Trust
Agreement with respect to which Ceding Company is a named party to the extent
that such Action, if successful, could (in Ceding Company's reasonable
opinion) materially interfere with the business, assets, liabilities,
obligations, financial condition, results of operations or reputation of
Ceding Company or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) any Action relating to a
class action or lawsuit that involves the SHIP Health Insurance Policies, the
SHIP Assignment Agreement or the SHIP Trust Agreement and other policies of
Ceding Company with respect to which Ceding Company is a named party. In any
such case, Ceding Company may propose terms on which it will assume control of
the defense of such Action and Reinsurer will in good faith cooperate with
Ceding Company to agree on the terms under which Ceding Company shall assume
control of such Action while preserving Reinsurer's commercial interests with
respect thereto and not exposing Reinsurer to the prospect of material
additional loss, cost, expense or risk (financial, operational, regulatory or
otherwise).

(d)With respect to any action required to be taken by Ceding Company without
delegation, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to ensure that Ceding
Company complies with all Applicable Law.

Health Insurance Policies without diminution because of any insolvency of
Ceding Company.



14 Reinsurer shall pay its share of Ceding Company's liability directly to Ceding
Company or its liquidators, receivers or statutory successors. The
liquidators, receivers or statutory successors shall give written notice to
Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against Ceding Company involving a SHIP
Health Insurance Policy reinsured under this Agreement within a reasonable
time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding. During the
pendency of such claim, Reinsurer may investigate the claim and interpose, at
its own expense, in the proceeding where the claim is to be adjudicated, any
defense or defenses which it may deem available to Ceding Company or Ceding
Company's liquidators, receivers or statutory successors. Any expense
Reinsurer thus incurs shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, to
Ceding Company as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of the
proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to Ceding Company solely
from the defense undertaken by Reinsurer. In the event two or more assuming
Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to
interpose a defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though such expenses had been
incurred by Ceding Company.



Section 5.3 Ceding Company Indemnification. Ceding Company hereby indemnifies
and holds Reinsurer harmless from and against all loss, damage, cost and
expense of any nature, including legal, accounting and other professional fees
(collectively, "Losses"), arising from (i) any liability relating to the
Insurance Policies that results from Ceding Company's acts, errors or
omissions that occur on or after the Effective Date (excluding, for this
purpose, any acts, errors or omissions of Ceding Company that occur or fail to
occur as a result of Ceding Company following instructions or directives by or
on behalf of Reinsurer), (ii) the Ceding Company Retained Liabilities, or
(iii) any violation or breach of this Agreement by Ceding Company.

Miscellaneous Provisions



Section 9.1 Arbitration.

(a)Any dispute or other matter in question between Reinsurer and Ceding
Company arising out of, or relating to, the formation, interpretation,
performance, or breach of this Agreement, whether such dispute arises before
or after termination of this Agreement, and whether in contract or in tort,
shall be settled by arbitration.

(b)Reinsurer and Ceding Company agree that, prior to resorting to arbitration,
they shall negotiate diligently and in utmost good faith, in an effort to
resolve any dispute. Once a Party notifies the other of a dispute and invokes
this paragraph, the Parties shall have sixty (60) days (or such longer period
as they may agree) within which to negotiate a resolution. At the end of sixty
(60) days, either Party may initiate arbitration.

(c)To initiate arbitration, either Reinsurer or Ceding Company shall notify
the other Party in writing of its desire to arbitrate. The notice shall
identify the claimant and the contract at issue, if applicable, and the nature
of the claims and/or issues. Notice shall be sent certified mail, with return
receipt, or another service which produces a receipt. The arbitration will be
deemed to have been commenced on the date the notice of arbitration is
received.

(d)There shall be three (3) arbitrators who each shall have no less than ten
(10) years of industry experience and who are (i) current or former officers
of life or health insurance or life or health reinsurance companies, or (ii)
professionals with no less than twenty (20) years of experience in or serving
the life or health insurance or reinsurance industries other than the Parties
to this Agreement, their Affiliates or subsidiaries. The arbitrators shall be



17 disinterested and shall not be under the control of any party to the
arbitration, nor shall any member of the panel have a financial interest in
the outcome of the dispute.

(e)Within thirty (30) days following the commencement of the arbitration
proceedings, each Party shall provide the other with the identification of
their appointed arbitrator, and provide a copy of the arbitrator's curriculum
vitae. If either Party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within
thirty (30) days, the other Party may appoint the second arbitrator to act as
the appointed arbitrator for the defaulting party. The Parties' appointed
arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator (the "Umpire"). Each
Party may consult, in confidence, with the arbitrator they appointed
concerning the appointment of an Umpire. If the two (2) Party-appointed
arbitrators fail to reach agreement on an Umpire within sixty (60) days of
their appointment, each Party shall exchange, within seven (7) days
thereafter, six (6) names of qualified individuals. Each Party shall select
three (3) names from the list and notify the other Party as to its selection.
Each Party shall rank the six (6) candidates in order of preference, and the
individual with the lowest total numerical ranking will act as Umpire. If the
ranking results in a tie, the Parties shall draw lots from the tied
individuals, and the individual chosen by lot shall act as Umpire. If either
Party fails to act in utmost good faith within a reasonable period of time to
complete these procedures, the non-defaulting Party shall appoint the Umpire
from its original candidate pool. Neither Party nor their respective
representatives shall inform the Umpire which Party initiated his or her
selection.

(f)In the event any arbitrator fails, refuses, or becomes unable to act as
such before an award has been rendered, a successor shall be selected in the
same manner as the original arbitrator.

outlining the issues in dispute and the reasons for their respective positions
within thirty (30) days of the notice of the appointment of the Umpire.

(h)Insofar as not in conflict with the express terms of this Agreement, it is
the intention of the Parties that customs and practices of the life and health
insurance and reinsurance industries may be considered by the arbitrators in
resolving any ambiguities inherent in this Agreement or its operation. In the
absence of any such ambiguity, the express terms of this Agreement shall
control.

(i)The arbitrators shall decide all substantive and procedural issues by a
majority of votes. As soon as possible, the arbitrators shall establish
arbitration procedures as warranted by the facts and issues of the particular
case. Except as provided specifically in this Article, the arbitrators shall
have the power to determine all procedural rules of the arbitration,
including, but not limited to inspection of documents, examination of
witnesses, and any other matter related to the conduct of the arbitration.
Each Party may examine the witnesses who testify at the arbitration hearing.
Each Party shall have right to be represented by legal counsel. The arbitrator
shall not be obligated to follow judicial formalities or the rules of evidence
except to the extent required by Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the panel and the Umpire shall have the authority to issue
subpoenas (including subpoenas to third party witnesses) and other orders to
enforce their decisions. Ex parte communications with Party-appointed
arbitrators shall be permitted until the arbitration hearing commences.

(j)The arbitrators shall recognize the attorney/client privilege and neither a
Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or result of any
arbitration hereunder,



18 except to the extent such disclosure may be required for review and
enforcement by a court of competent jurisdiction, independent accounting
audit, to support reinsurance or retrocessional recoveries, or is otherwise
agreed to by the Parties. Any third party receiving confidential information
must agree to maintain confidentiality before disclosure shall be permitted.

(k) The location of all proceedings shall be determined by the arbitrators.

(l)The panel may issue orders for interim relief upon showing of good cause,
including pre-award security. Absent good cause for an extension as determined
by the panel, the panel shall render the award within thirty (30) days after
the date of the closing of the hearing, or if an arbitration hearing has been
waived or otherwise dispensed with, within thirty (30) days after the date
that the panel received all materials submitted by the Parties for
disposition. The panel is authorized to award any remedy or sanctions allowed
by Applicable Law, including, but not limited to monetary damages, equitable
relief, pre- or post-award interest, costs of arbitration, attorneys' fees,
and other final or interim relief. Arbitrators shall not be empowered to award
damages in excess of compensatory damages, and each party irrevocably waives
any damages in excess of compensatory damages.

(m)The decision of the arbitrators shall be made by majority rule, and shall
be final and binding on both Parties. There shall be no appeal from the
decision, except that the Parties retain all rights to challenge under the
Federal Arbitration Act. Either Party to the arbitration may petition any
court having jurisdiction over the parties to reduce the decision to judgment.

(n)Unless the arbitrators decide otherwise, each Party shall bear the expense
of its own arbitration activities, including its appointed arbitrator and any
outside attorney and witness fees. The Parties shall jointly and equally bear
the expense of the Umpire and other costs of the arbitration.



Section 9.2 Joinder. For any dispute arising out of, or relating to, the
formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, which also
relates or arises from a parallel question under the terms of the SHIP
Assignment Agreement, the Parties shall consent to joinder of or to any
dispute or other matter in question between Ceding Company and Reinsurer
arising out of, or relating to, the formation, interpretation, performance or
breach of this Agreement with the dispute resolution proceedings between
Ceding Company and SHIP, including consenting to the forum and venue of such
dispute resolution proceedings. Neither Party shall contest such joinder,
whether such objection is based on jurisdiction, venue, scope of the mandatory
arbitration provisions of this Agreement or otherwise. The Parties expressly
acknowledge that the purpose of this provision is solely to enhance the
efficiency and equitable character of dispute resolution between the
respective Parties, where such disputes include common facts relative to
disputes concerning the terms of the SHIP Assignment Agreement.



Section 9.3 Assignment and Delegation. This Agreement may not be assigned
(whether by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise), and the duties and
obligations hereunder may not be delegated, by any Party unless such
assignment or delegation is agreed to in advance in writing by both Parties
hereto, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties, their



19 permitted assignees, delegees and successors (including, without limitation,
any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of a Party).

state and federal privacy laws and requirements. In addition, each Party (i)
shall keep the business, policy and other records of the other Party
confidential, (ii) shall not disclose or reveal such records to anyone and
(iii) shall not use the records for any purpose whatsoever, other than
performing its responsibilities under this Agreement, unless (iv) the Party is
legally required to disclose or reveal the information contained in such
records. In that event, the information shall be disclosed only to the extent
legally required and only after giving ten (10) calendar days' prior notice to
the other Party.

accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, and in reliance upon the conditions and covenants contained
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as
follows (unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used herein and not
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings indicated first, in the
Transition Services Agreement, and then if not defined therein, then in the
Stock Purchase Agreement):

ARTICLE I

SPECIAL SUPPORT SERVICES



Section 1.01. Special Support Services.

(a)During the Term, as requested, CNO will work in good faith and use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable support to Wilton Re in
the (i) analysis and review of historical, current and prospective management
of Non-Guaranteed Elements (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) with
respect to the Insurance Contracts, including, without limitation, actuarial,
operational, policyholder support and service aspects thereof, (ii)
operational implementation of management decisions determined by CLIC and
Wilton Re and (iii) support in the management of current and prospective legal
matters concerning the Insurance Contacts and the Business, including
complaints and litigation processes and proceedings (together, the "Special
Support Services"), including the Special Support Services listed on Schedule
1.01 hereto.

(b)The Parties acknowledge and agree that CLIC shall have sole discretion
regarding, and responsibility for, determining, approving and implementing
actions with respect to the management of Non-Guaranteed Elements with respect
to the Insurance Contracts any and all decisions with respect to the
management and resolution of any disputes or litigation with respect thereto.
The Special Support



1 Services are agreed to be supplemental services provided by CNO to support
CLIC's management of Non-Guaranteed Elements with respect to the Insurance
Contracts and related litigation proceedings and shall not constitute, nor
shall be deemed to constitute, advice with respect to, or create any
delegation by Wilton Re or CLIC of management authority, decision-making or
responsibility regarding the management of the Business. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Special Support Services
hereunder shall in no event include: investment management, investment
advisory, actuarial opinions or legal services or opinions.



Section 1.02. Performance Standard.

(a)Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, CNO shall, at its own
expense and without any rights to reimbursement from Wilton Re, provide the
Special Support Services in conformity with Applicable Law and the terms of
this Agreement.

(b)CNO shall not be obligated to provide any Special Support Service to the
extent such performance would require CNO or any Affiliate to violate: (i) any
Applicable Law or any judicial or administrative process or proceeding, (ii)
CNO's then-current written policies and procedures generally applicable to it
or its Affiliates' businesses or (iii) a then-existing executed written
agreement between CNO and a non-affiliated third party.



Section 1.03. Independent Contractor. For all purposes hereof, CNO and each
Service Provider shall at all times act as an independent contractor and CNO
and the Service Providers, on the one hand, and Wilton Re and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, shall not be deemed agents, lawyers, employees,
representatives, joint venturers or fiduciaries of one another, nor shall this
Agreement, the provision of Special Support Services or the performance of any
activity or transaction contemplated hereby be deemed to create any
partnership or joint venture between the Parties or among their Affiliates or,
in CNO's case, its Service Providers.



Section 1.04. Continued Access to Key Employees. Other than as provided in
this Section 1.04, CNO shall not be obligated (i) to hire or cause any Service
Provider to hire any additional employees, maintain the employment of any
specific employee or acquire resources to provide the Special Support Services
or; (ii) to retain, replace or increase the number of employees or Service
Providers engaged in performing, or otherwise used in connection with the
delivery of, such services. CNO acknowledges that Wilton Re requests access to
one or more of the employees listed on Schedule 1.04 hereto (the "Designated
Employees") as principals in the provision of the Special Support Services.
Subject to Applicable Law and to the extent any Designated Employee remains an
employee of CNO or its Affiliates, CNO agrees that its shall cooperate in good
faith and use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure such employee's
availability for a period not less than the Term of this Agreement, and, in
such respect, agrees to consult with Wilton Re concerning material decisions
concerning the continued employment by CNO and its Affiliates of each of the
Designated Employees; provided that nothing herein shall require CNO or any of
its Affiliates to offer the Designated Employee any increased or additional
compensation or benefits to ensure such employees' continued employment for
the Term of this Agreement. The Parties have and will continue to discuss the
optimal approach to ensuring the availability to CLIC of the Designated
Employees after Closing, and such alternative approaches under consideration
may include direct employment of one or more Designated Employee by Wilton Re
or its Affiliates. If, upon agreement between the Parties, Wilton Re or any of
its Affiliates hire, contract with (other than this Agreement) or employ any
Designated Employee prior to the date of discontinuation of all Services
hereunder for which such Designated Employee has any duties or obligations,
CNO's obligations hereunder with respect to such Services, to the extent
provided or supported by such



2 employee shall (i) immediately terminate if such employee is the sole employee
responsible for providing or supporting such Service, and, any relevant
Schedule shall be deemed amended to remove such Service or (ii) be limited and
the applicable Performance Standard for such Service shall be reduced to the
extent attributable to the fact that the Designated Employee is no longer
employed by CNO or its Affiliates.

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated as of [•] is
entered into by and between CNO Services, LLC, an Indiana limited liability
company ("CNO") and Wilton Reassurance Company, a Minnesota domestic life
insurance company ("Wilton Re"). CNO and Wilton Re are referred to herein
collectively as the "Parties" and each, individually, as a "Party."

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, CNO Financial Group, Inc. ("CFG") and Wilton Re entered into that
certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2014 (the "Stock
Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which CFG agreed to sell, and Wilton Re
agreed to buy, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Conseco Life
Insurance Company, an Indiana stock life insurance company ("CLIC");

WHEREAS, the Stock Purchase Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Closing"), CNO
and Wilton Re shall execute and deliver this Agreement, which shall (together
with any applicable provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement) govern the
provision by CNO of support services with respect to CLIC's insurance policies
and contracts after the Restructuring (as such term is used in the Stock
Purchase Agreement (the "Business") for an agreed transition period following
Closing; and

WHEREAS, CNO and Wilton Re desire that, following the Closing under the Stock
Purchase Agreement, CNO shall provide or cause to be provided to CLIC solely
in connection with the transition of the Business to Wilton Re certain
services for a limited period of time in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth herein, including, without limitation, policy
administration and policyholder services and certain actuarial, financial
reporting, regulatory and other services with respect to CLIC and the direct
and assumed insurance policies and contracts comprising the Business
(together, the "Insurance Contracts") and the related services and support
described herein; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, and in reliance upon the conditions and covenants contained
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby agree as
follows (unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used herein and not
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings indicated in the Stock
Purchase Agreement):

ARTICLE I

TRANSITION AND RELATED SERVICES



Section 1.01. Transition Services.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in accordance with
the applicable terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, during the Term CNO
shall provide or cause its Service Providers to provide to CLIC all services
as are now or in the twelve months immediately preceding Closing have been
provided by CNO and/or Service Providers to CLIC or with respect the Business,
consistent with the Performance Standard (as defined below), including,
without limitation, the services set forth in Schedules 1.01 and 1.02 hereto;
provided, however, that CNO shall provide or cause to be provided transition
services solely in connection with the Business and CLIC shall use such
transition services solely in support of the Business and, provided, further,
that CNO shall have no obligation to provide or cause to be provided any
services that (i) have been assumed by Wilton Re as set forth in Schedule
1.01(a) hereto; or (ii) are listed as excluded services pursuant to Schedule
1.01(a) hereto (the "Excluded Services" and the services described in this Section 1.01(a),
as modified by the foregoing proviso clauses, being referred to collectively
as the "Transition Services").

(b)In the event that Wilton Re requests that CNO provide or cause to be
provided additional services that are not within the scope of the Transition
Services contemplated by Section 1.01(a), but which Wilton Re reasonably
believes would facilitate its ownership and operation of CLIC and the Business
following Closing ("Special Project Services"), CNO shall consider such
request in good faith and if it decides it is willing to provide or to cause
one of its Affiliates to provide such Special Project Services, in CNO's
reasonable discretion, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on
the terms upon which CNO would provide such Special Project Services,
including the allocation of any Unusual Expenses pursuant to Section 2.01(b)
herein; provided that if CNO determines, in its reasonable discretion, that
such Special Project Services carry an expense of greater than $150,000.00,
the Parties shall submit such requested Special Project Services to the
Transition Committee for approval. In the event that CNO agrees to provide any
such Special Project Service, the Parties will enter into a written amendment
to this Agreement amending Schedules 1.01 or 1.02, as applicable, to reflect
such Special Project Service, and such Special Project Service shall be deemed
to be part of this Agreement and the Services from and after the date of such
amendment. The foregoing obligations of CNO with respect to a Special Project
Service shall not apply with respect to any services that are Excluded
Services set forth in Schedule 1.01(a) hereto.

(c)Subject to any consent required under the relevant contracts under which
Transition Services are provided, CNO and its Affiliates may subcontract for
the performance of any Transition Service to another Person that is not an
Affiliate (the "Subcontractor") if, (i) immediately prior to the SPA Signing
Date, CNO or Service Providers provided such Transition Service to the
Business by subcontracting with a Subcontractor as disclosed in Schedule
1.01(c) hereto, (ii) if the service to be subcontracted is primarily a routine
task or function or (iii)(A) CNO or its Affiliates have provided Wilton Re
with reasonable advance written notice of their intention to subcontract to an
unaffiliated Person and (B) Wilton Re has given its prior written consent
thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
No such subcontracting shall relieve CNO from any of its obligations or
liabilities hereunder and CNO shall remain responsible for all obligations or
liabilities of such Subcontractor with respect to the provision of such
Transition Service as if provided by CNO.

(d)For purposes of this Agreement, "Service Providers" shall mean Affiliates
of CNO, their employees, agents and contractors and any Subcontractors.

(e)In performing their respective duties hereunder, all personnel engaged in
providing Transition Services shall be under the direction, control and
supervision of CNO; and CNO shall, subject to Section 1.05 below, have the
sole right to exercise all authority with respect to the employment (including
termination of employment), assignment and compensation of such personnel. The
employees, agents or consultants of CNO or any Service Provider engaged in
providing Transition Services to CLIC shall not, by virtue thereof, become
employees of CLIC or Wilton Re.



Section 1.02. Conversion Support Services.

(a)During the Term and as set forth in Section 7.01 herein, CNO will work in
good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance to
Wilton Re, as may be reasonably requested, in Wilton Re's design, planning,
preparation for and implementation of an orderly conversion and transition
process for the Business, based on a mutually-agreed conversion plan to be
developed by Wilton Re, on or before mutually-agreed projected or target
administrative transfer dates therefor



2 (together referred to as the "Conversion Support Services"). The assistance
and services which Wilton Re initially expects will be needed from CNO in
order to effect the transition and conversion of the Business are described in
Schedule 1.02, and such Schedule shall be updated from time-to-time by the
Transition Committee based upon further meetings by the Parties regarding the
Conversion Support Services, in order to effect the intent of this Section
1.02. In connection with the provision of the Conversion Support Services, the
Parties will cooperate in good faith to produce and complete agreed-upon
Project Output Documents in accordance with a mutually agreed upon timeline
documenting material agreed conversion and transition workplans and process
management steps expected to be implemented and will monitor and manage such
processes cooperatively in good faith.

(b)CNO shall, during a commercially reasonable period and on a basis to be
mutually agreed to furnish Wilton Re with true, correct and complete copies of
its application forms, policy and rider forms (with state-by-state variations
thereof), premium and non-forfeiture valuation manuals, reserve tables,
actuarial memoranda, and any other forms, tables or information or ceded
reinsurance agreements with respect to the Insurance Contracts required for
proper administration (including valuation and regulatory compliance) with
respect to the Insurance Contracts and any ceded reinsurance related thereto
(the "CNO Admin Materials").

(c)To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and subject to applicable
licensing or contractual restrictions, during the Term and in connection with
the transition and conversion services, CNO shall provide CLIC with access to
all software and data processing systems currently used to perform the
administrative services for the Insurance Contracts. For software systems not
owned or developed by CLIC or its Affiliates, CNO shall exercise good faith
efforts to arrange for use by CLIC and any outsourcing partners specifically
identified to CNO by CLIC or Wilton Re, with any incremental fees due or costs
related thereto to be apportioned in the manner set forth in Section 5.4 of
the Stock Purchase Agreement. CNO shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to involve Wilton Re in all material negotiations concerning
acquisition of subject license rights with any third party providers of
software or other technologies now used by CLIC or CNO in administering the
Insurance Contracts.



Section 1.03. Performance Standard. Except as provided in Section 1.04 below,
CNO shall, and shall cause Service Providers to, provide the Services in good
faith and with at least the care, skill, prudence and diligence with which
such Services have been provided in the twelve (12) months immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and otherwise with at least the care, skill, prudence and
diligence which CNO generally applies to the management of its, and its
Affiliates, business, and in all cases in accordance with the applicable terms
of this Agreement and Applicable Law (collectively, the "Performance
Standard"). For the sake of clarity, the term Applicable Law as used in this
Agreement includes, without limitation, the terms of any regulatory orders or
other orders or settlements applicable to CLIC or the Business (including the
terms of any settlement agreement effective with respect to one or more of the
Specified Litigation Matters (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement)).
Wilton Re understands and agrees that CNO is not in the business of providing
transition services to third parties, and under no circumstances shall CNO be
held accountable to a higher standard of care than that set forth herein.
Except as set forth specifically in this Section 1.03 or Section 1.04 herein,
no performance level, service level or similar service standard or description
set forth in Schedules 1.01 or 1.02 herein shall alter, amend or supplement
the Performance Standard, all such standards shall be of no force or effect
and all such standards shall only be deemed to describe the scope of certain
Services provided hereunder.

Section 1.04. Exceptions and Limitations on Services.

(a)Pursuant to Schedule 1.04 attached hereto, services related to
implementation and administration of Schedule NGE Changes shall be subject to
the limits and target dates set forth therein.

(b)Wilton Re acknowledges and agrees that CNO's obligation to provide or cause
Service Providers to provide Services to CLIC in accordance with the
Performance Standard and any delay or failure to perform by CNO or Service
Providers under this Agreement shall be subject to and shall be limited to the
extent to which (i) CLIC's failure to cooperate with CNO or a Service
Provider, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement, where such
failure (A) is not cured within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice
from CNO, and (B) materially impedes CNO's or a Service Provider's ability to
provide Services to Wilton Re or its Affiliates; (ii) Applicable Law, applied
to the Business as owned by Wilton Re, is different than as applied to the
Business as owned by CNO prior to the Closing; or (iii) the Policy Fee as set
forth in Section 2.02 herein becomes more than sixty (60) days overdue and CNO
has provided written notice to Wilton Re and a period of ten (10) days for
Wilton Re to cure such failure, such Services to commence only after Wilton Re
has fully cured any such delinquent payment.

(c)CNO shall not be obligated to provide or cause any Service Provider to
provide any Service to the extent such performance would require CNO or such
Service Provider to violate any Applicable Law or any judicial or
administrative process or proceeding. In the event CNO or any Service Provider
would otherwise be prohibited from providing any Service due to the failure of
CNO or such Service Provider to obtain any required third party consents under
a written agreement between CNO (or such Service Provider) and a non-
affiliated third party in effect on the date hereof, CNO shall be obligated to
procure an alternative source or method of delivery of such Service that is
reasonably acceptable to Wilton Re in accordance with Section 1.06.

(d)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CNO reserves the
right to make reasonable changes to (i) the manner in which Services are
provided, (ii) the location from which the Services are provided except to the
extent that such changes include the transfer of the administration of the
Insurance Contracts to any other facility other than where such Insurance
Contracts are administered at the Closing Date, and (iii) the personnel
involved in the provision of the Services, but in each case only to the extent
such changes do not result in a breach of the Performance Standard.

(e)Wilton Re may request in writing any change to a Transition Service, which
request shall include a description of the proposed change requested and the
associated business specifications ("Change Request"). CNO shall have ten (10)
Business Days from the date of receipt of the Change Request (unless otherwise
mutually agreed upon by the Parties) to provide Wilton Re with a written
proposal for such Change Request ("Change Request Proposal"). Each such Change
Request Proposal shall refer to the description of the proposed Change Request
provided by Wilton Re and shall include the estimated time and price of
implementing the Change Request (including any third party consents necessary
to implement the Change Request) and any potential impact of the Change
Request on the Service and any fees related thereto. The Parties shall, and
CNO shall cause the Service Providers to, act in good faith concerning Change
Requests, and shall not unreasonably cause any delay in relation to them,
provided, that CNO may reasonably take into consideration (i) any adverse
impact that any requested change may have on the level or quality of (A) other
Services provided by CNO or its Affiliates or the businesses of CNO or its
Affiliates or (B) any obligation of CNO under the Stock Purchase Agreement or
any Transaction Agreements, and, in each case, taking into account CNO's
resource limitations and capacity; (ii) whether any requested change may cause
CNO to violate Applicable Law, CNO's then-current written policies and
procedures generally applicable to its or its Affiliates' businesses or,
subject to the Parties' obligations under Section 5.4 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, a then-existing executed agreement between CNO and a non-affiliated
Person; or (iii) whether any requested



4 change is not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the Business, and, based
on its reasonable consideration of (i), (ii) or (iii), CNO may reject the
Change Request. If the Parties agree upon a Change Request, this Agreement and
the Schedules hereto shall be deemed amended to include the terms and
conditions of such agreed-upon Change Request. If the Parties do not agree
upon a Change Request Proposal or a written variation thereof within ten (10)
Business Days after the date such Proposal is delivered to Wilton Re, then the
dispute as to the Proposal will be resolved in accordance with Section 12.05
on an expedited basis.

(f)CNO shall not be obligated (i) to hire or cause any Service Provider to
hire any additional employees, maintain the employment of any specific
employee, or acquire additional equipment, software or other resources to
provide the Services or; (ii) to retain, replace or increase the number of
employees or Service Providers engaged in performing, or otherwise used in
connection with the delivery of the Services. Notwithstanding subsections (i)
and (ii) above, no attrition in CNO's or any Service Provider's personnel
shall relieve CNO from complying with the Performance Standard.

(g)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Services
hereunder shall in no event include investment management, advisory or legal
services.



Section 1.05. Independent Contractor. For all purposes hereof, CNO and each
Service Provider shall at all times act as an independent contractor and CNO
and the Service Providers, on the one hand, and Wilton Re and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, shall not be deemed agents, lawyers, employees,
representatives, joint venturers or fiduciaries of one another, nor shall this
Agreement, the Transition Services, Conversion Support Services or any
activity or any transaction contemplated hereby be deemed to create any
partnership or joint venture between the Parties or among their Affiliates or,
in CNO's case, its Service Providers.



Section 1.06. Consents and Licenses. Consistent with its obligations in this
Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, CNO shall at all times during the
term of this Agreement keep and maintain in full force and effect all Permits
as necessary to perform the Services in the manner required by this Agreement.
CNO shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate, obtain and
maintain any and all consents from non-Affiliated service providers and
intellectual property licensors that provide services or license intellectual
property to CNO or Service Providers where agreements with such service
providers or licensors require consent for the provision of Services in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement. Wilton Re shall cooperate with CNO, and
may participate or consult with respect to CNO's negotiations to obtain such
consents, licenses and qualifications. Subject at all times to Section
1.04(c), to the extent that CNO is unable to obtain any such consents,
licenses or qualifications, CNO shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain acceptable alternative arrangements with Wilton Re's participation
and cooperation. The initial costs, fees and expenses of obtaining the
licenses, consents and qualifications, and the costs, fees and expenses of any
expanded scope thereof requested by Wilton Re and reasonably related to the
Services, shall be apportioned as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement. Subject to obtaining any necessary third party consents in
accordance with this Section 1.06 and unless such Services would violate
Applicable Law, CNO or its Service Providers shall provide Wilton Re with the
benefits of any Licensed Intellectual Property to the extent necessary to
provide the Services.



5 

Section 1.07. Reports and Actuarial Certifications.

(a)Within a time period mutually agreeable to CNO and Wilton Re, but in no
event more than ten (10) days for cash items and thirty (30) days for reserve
items, following the end of each calendar quarter after the Closing Date and
prior to the end of the Term, CNO will provide Wilton Re with the information
needed by Wilton Re for reporting with respect to the Insurance Contracts in
its statutory financial statements and tax filings and otherwise as set forth
on Schedule 1.01. The form of the report and the information to be provided is
set forth in Schedule 1.07. From time to time, as requested, CNO shall provide
to Wilton Re information required to accurately and reasonably timely respond
to formal and informal actuarial, financial, legal, operational and other
inquiries of governmental authorities, representatives of rating agencies and
others concerning CLIC or the Business.

(b)Each year in connection with the preparation of CLIC\'s annual financial
statements, CNO\'s appointed actuary shall provide to CLIC\'s appointed
actuary a certificate of reliance stating that in his or her opinion, the
reserves and related actuarial values concerning the Insurance Contracts:

| 
---|--- 

i.

|

are computed in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards
consistently applied and are fairly stated, in accordance with sound actuarial
principles; 

| 
---|--- 

ii.

|

are based on actuarial assumptions which produce reserves at least as great as
those called for in any contract provision as to reserve basis and method, and
are in accordance with all other policy or contract provisions; and 

| 
---|--- 

iii.

|

meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of the State of
Indiana and, to the extent applicable Indiana regulations vary materially from
the parallel requirements of the State of Minnesota, a good faith estimate of
the effects of any such differences and a summary description of the
methodologies used in developing such estimations. 

 

ARTICLE II

FEES AND PAYMENT

Section 2.01. Fees.

(a)Services shall be provided in consideration of payment by Wilton Re to CNO
of the fees set forth in this Agreement ("Fees"), including a Services fee
consisting of: (i) for the first year of this Agreement, an annual Policy Fee
equal to $25,000,000, payable in equal monthly installments in accordance with
Section 2.02 below (the "First Year Policy Fee"), (ii) for the second year of
this Agreement, an annual Policy Fee equal to $16,000,000, payable in equal
monthly installments in accordance with Section 2.02 below (the "Second Year
Policy Fee" and, together with the First Year Policy Fee, the "Policy Fee"),
and (iii) in either the first year or the second year of this Agreement, any
and all amounts for work done pursuant to Change Requests or Special Project
Services as mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to Sections 1.02(b) and
1.04(d) herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Schedule 2.01
hereto, any reduction in Services over time, as contemplated herein or
otherwise, shall not be a basis to imply or impute any agreement or intent to
adjust the Policy Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the occurrence of a Conversion Completion Date in accordance with
Section 7.01 shall not alter or eliminate Wilton Re's obligation to pay the
Policy Fee in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.01 and Section 2.02
below.

(b)Without duplication of the foregoing, Wilton Re agrees to pay its allocated
portion of any applicable Unusual Expenses (as defined below). Unusual
Expenses shall be identified and shared by the Parties on an equitable basis
and the Parties commit to work in good faith to determine any such



6 allocation as required. Failing agreement as to the foregoing allocation, such
expenses shall be borne by the Parties in equal shares unless either Party
elects to resolve such disagreement in accordance with the requirements of
Section 12.05 (Arbitration); except for the case of any material incremental
costs incurred by CNO arising from any change in Applicable Law that causes
CNO to provide Services to CLIC that do not apply to the management of CNO and
its Affiliates' other comparable business, in all cases such additional costs
arising from changes in Applicable Law after the Closing Date to be allocated
entirely to Wilton Re. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Unusual
Expenses" means (i) any costs, fees or expenses agreed to or associated with
any Special Project Services, and (ii) any other material, non-routine
operational charge, cost or expense incurred by CNO which is not in the
reasonable contemplation of the Parties as of the date hereof but which arises
after the Closing Date in connection with the performance of Services under
this Agreement consistent with the Performance Standard; provided, however,
that in no event shall the term "Unusual Expenses" include (1) routine costs
of claim investigation or management (both medical and non-medical), routine
administration expenses, including but not limited to, customary elements of
corporate overhead, home office expenses, compensation of officers and
employees of CNO or any Service Provider and other ordinary course expenses by
one or more Service Providers in connection with the provision of the
Services; (2) any Excluded Liability (as such term is used in the Stock
Purchase Agreement), (3) any item of cost or expense attributable principally
to the decisions, acts or omissions of CNO in providing the Services (4) any
element of cost or risk specifically considered or addressed herein or in the
Stock Purchase Agreement or (5) any material incremental costs to CNO arising
from any change in Applicable Law that causes CNO to provide Services to CLIC
that do not apply to the management of CNO and its Affiliates' other
comparable business, as described in this Section 2.01(b).

(c)Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, CNO shall be
solely liable for, and shall pay, all fees, costs or other expenses (including
sales and service taxes) payable to third parties that are not Affiliates in
connection with the Services provided by CNO hereunder.



Section 2.02. Payment Terms.

(a)On the first Business Day of each month during the Term on which CNO or
Service Providers provide or cause to be provided Services, Wilton Re shall
remit to CNO, without invoice, the amount of the Policy Fee then due (in
advance for such month), by wire transfer in immediately available U.S.
dollars, to a bank and account to be designated by CNO. Any portion of the
Policy Fee unpaid after the fifth (5th) day of the calendar month shall bear
an overdue interest charge calculated at an annual rate equal to LIBOR as of
such date. In no event shall Wilton Re offset any amounts due against the
Policy Fee or any other payment due hereunder.

(b)All other amounts due hereunder shall be paid within thirty (30) days of
receipt of an invoice with respect to such amount.

(c)Any Policy Fee, and any other amount due hereunder, that remains unpaid for
sixty (60) days following its due date shall bear an overdue interest charge
calculated at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus one percent (1%) as of such
date until paid. For purposes of this Agreement, "LIBOR" means, as of any
date, a rate per annum equal to the three (3) month London Interbank Offered
Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on such date.



Section 2.03. Periodic Payments. If an interim monthly accounting reflects a
balance due to Wilton Re, the amount(s) shown as due shall be paid within five
(5) Business Days of the delivery of the interim monthly accounting. If (i) an
Accounting reflects a balance due CNO and (ii) Wilton Re does not



7 object to the interim monthly accounting within five (5) Business Days of its
delivery, the amount(s) shown as due shall be paid within seven (7) Business
Days after the date on which the interim monthly accounting was delivered. Any
dispute over any amount shown on an interim monthly accounting that cannot be
amicably resolved by the Parties shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 2.04 below.



Section 2.04. Fee Disputes. In the event that Wilton Re chooses in good faith
to dispute a specific item of any invoice or interim monthly accounting
provided hereunder, Wilton Re shall deliver to CNO written notice of such
specific items that are disputed describing in reasonable detail the basis for
any such dispute and pay the undisputed amount within the time otherwise
required for payment of such specific items. The Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with respect to such
disputed amount. Any such dispute shall be referred to the Services
Coordinators in accordance with Articles V hereof and settlements of any such
disputed amounts will include interest charges computed at LIBOR from the date
such amount was due under Section 2.02 above until paid. Any invoice, or
portion thereof, which is not disputed within ninety days (90) after the final
post-Term invoice, shall be deemed valid and no objection or further objection
thereto shall be raised by Wilton Re.



ARTICLE III

cause its Affiliates to, and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Service Providers to, retain all books and records relating to the
Business with respect to any pre-Closing periods (the "Pre-Closing Books and
Records") in accordance with Applicable Law, their respective records
retention policies, and the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. Wilton Re shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain the Pre-

(b)CNO shall, and shall cause Service Providers to, retain such TSA Books and
Records as are prepared by CNO or Service Providers in accordance with
Applicable Law and their records retention policies and the terms and
conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement; provided that CNO and its
Affiliates shall have no obligation to maintain or retain any Pre-Closing
Books and Records or TSA Books and Records to the extent that electronic or
paper copies or originals of such books and records are delivered to Wilton Re
or CLIC at or prior to the end of the Term.



Section 3.03. Access.

(a)During the Term, subject to Applicable Law and Section 3.03(b) below and
the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Wilton Re may from
time to time reasonably request, and CNO shall provide, at reasonable times
during normal business hours, reasonable access for Wilton Re or its
designee(s) (including Wilton Re's auditors) to examine any Pre-Closing Books
and Records and TSA Books and Records (collectively, "CLIC Books and Records")
and to speak with employees of CNO or any Service Provider who are familiar
with the Services, for any reasonable business purpose (including



8 without limitation any audit, internal controls review and assessment). Such
access shall include the right of Wilton Re, at Wilton Re's sole expense, to
make and retain copies of any such CLIC Books and Records as Wilton Re
reasonably deems necessary. Wilton Re shall give CNO reasonable prior notice
of the need for such access and shall comply with any written instructions
provided by CNO in connection with the use of or access to any CNO's
information, personnel, facilities, office and storage space.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Party
shall be required to provide the other Party with any information, reports,
documents, data or access to any information, reports, documents, data,
systems, software, databases, office and storage space as regards, in each
instance, its Intellectual Property, processes, procedures, and other
Insurance Contract information utilized in providing services pursuant hereto
or to another Transaction Agreement (whether prepared before, on or after the
Closing Date), except to the extent (i) permitted by Applicable Law, (ii) as
would be in conformity with the provisions and intent of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, (iii) permitted by any Insurance Contract or other Contract to
which the service provider is a party without violating any confidentiality
provisions thereof, or (iv) not subject to attorney-client or other legal
privilege and subject to the provisions regarding confidentiality and security
of the Stock Purchase Agreement and security and privacy provisions hereof or
in the applicable Transaction Agreement.



ARTICLE IV

TRANSFER OF RECORDS



Section 4.01. Current Books and Records. Subject to the conversion plan as
described in Section 1.02 herein, CNO shall assist Wilton Re in an orderly
transition of such CLIC Books and Records as are "current" (i.e., as have been
created up to approximately two (2) years prior to the date of such
transition) (the "Current Books and Records") to be transferred from CNO's
Systems (defined in Section 8.02 below) to Wilton Re's Systems. At such time,
CNO will, or will cause, the applicable Service Provider to transfer, at
Wilton Re's expense (except for electronic data, which such transfer shall be
at CNO's expense), to Wilton Re, all such Current Books and Records, provided
that CNO or the Service Provider, as the case may be, may retain copies
thereof (a) as required by Applicable Law or any judicial or administrative
process or proceeding (in which case such Current Books and Records are not to
be used for any purpose by CNO or such Service Provider except as required by
Applicable Law or applicable judicial or administrative process or
proceeding), (b) to the extent that such Current Books and Records are
retained in archival back-up tapes or similar storage or are otherwise
retained in accordance with the ordinary course of business or internal
policies of CNO or such Service Provider (in which case such Current Books and
Records are not to be used for any purpose by CNO or such Service Provider
other than for archival purposes), and (c) to the extent such Current Books
and Records are needed by CNO or such Service Provider in connection with its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or any contracts.



Section 4.02. Historical Books and Records. Subject to any obligation of CNO
with respect to Books and Records as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements, as soon as practicable following the end
of the Term but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the
Term, CNO will, or will cause the applicable Service Provider to, at Wilton
Re's expense (except for electronic data, which such transfer shall be at
CNO's expense), transfer to Wilton Re, all remaining CLIC Books and Records
that have not been transferred to Wilton Re pursuant to Section 4.01 above
(the "Historical Books and Records"), and CNO or Service Provider, as the case
may be, may retain copies thereof (a) as required by Applicable Law or any
judicial or administrative process or proceeding (in which case such
Historical Books and Records are not to be



9 used for any purpose by CNO or such Service Provider except as required by
Applicable Law or applicable judicial or administrative process or
proceeding), (b) to the extent that such Historical Books and Records are
retained in archival back-up tapes or similar storage media or are otherwise
retained in accordance with the ordinary course of business or internal
policies of CNO or such Service Provider (in which case such Historical Books
and Records are not to be used for any purpose by CNO or such Service Provider
other than for archival purposes), and (c) to the extent such Historical Books
and Records are needed by CNO or such Service Provider in connection with its
obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement, any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or any contracts. Until such time as CNO transfers all Historical

Service Providers to, reasonably assist Wilton Re with any reasonable request
relating to the Historical Books and Records, and Wilton Re will bear any
reasonable costs in connection therewith.



Section 4.03. Records Retention by Wilton Re. Wilton Re shall retain all CLIC

and will follow the provisions of Article V of the Stock Purchase Agreement
relating to the replacement of a Service Coordinator. The Service Coordinators
will resolve disputes pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.13 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement. Each Party may rely upon the other Party's Service
Coordinator to speak authoritatively for such Party for all purposes related
to this Agreement.



ARTICLE VI

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Section 6.01. Title to Intellectual Property.

(a)Wilton Re acknowledges and agrees for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates that the results and proceeds of the Services provided hereunder,
and all materials (excluding CLIC Books and Records which are addressed in
Articles III and IV above), products, reports, computer programs (source or
object code), documentation, deliverables and inventions developed or prepared
by CNO or Service Providers in performance of such Services (collectively,
"Work Product") constitute Confidential Information and, as between Wilton Re
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and CNO on the other, shall be deemed the
property of CNO's or Service Providers. All right, title and interest in such
Work Product shall belong exclusively to CNO or Service Providers (as between
Wilton Re and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and CNO or Service Providers on
the other), with CNO or the applicable Service Providers having the right to
obtain and to hold in their own names, copyright registrations, patents and
such other intellectual property protection as may be appropriate to the
subject matter, along with any extensions, and renewals thereof. To the extent
that title to any such Work Product may not vest in CNO or the applicable
Service Providers by operation of Applicable Law or any judicial or
administrative process or proceeding (as between Wilton Re and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and CNO and the Service Providers on the other), then Wilton
Re and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably assign and make a continuing
assignment of all right, title and interest therein, as existing or as arising
during the Term, to CNO and



10 the applicable Service Providers (as between Wilton Re and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and CNO and Service Providers on the other). Wilton Re agrees
for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates to give CNO and Service Providers,
and any Person designated by CNO or Service Providers, reasonable assistance
appropriate, or required, to perfect or memorialize the rights set forth in
this Section 6.01. All Work Product shall bear CNO's, or the applicable
Service Provider's, copyright and trade secret notices, as specified by CNO or
such Service Provider. CNO shall grant or use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the applicable Service Provider to grant a non-exclusive, non-
transferable license to Wilton Re or designated Affiliates, as applicable, to
use the Work Product in accordance with CNO's or the applicable Service
Provider's directions, during the portion of the Term for which such Work
Product is needed in connection with the relevant services provided hereunder.
Unless explicitly set forth pursuant to a written license agreement or written
assignment agreement with CNO or the applicable Service Provider, as
appropriate, no rights to the Work Product shall remain with Wilton Re or its
Affiliates following the earlier of the end of the Term or the termination of
the services provided hereunder. Nothing in this Section 6.01 shall be deemed
to alter or supersede any agreements with CNO or Service Providers as to the
ownership of any Work Product created hereunder.

(b)CNO, on behalf of itself and Service Providers, reserves all rights in and
to all tools, utilities and standards developed by CNO or Service Providers
prior to the Closing Date or independent of the Services and used to provide
the Services. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent CNO own any
modifications to the software licensed under the CNO's License Agreement, CNO
shall grant Wilton Re and its Affiliates a limited right and license to use
such modifications solely in connection with receiving the Services hereunder.



Section 6.02. No Transfer. CNO shall not be required to cause to be
transferred, assigned or otherwise conveyed to Wilton Re or its Affiliates any
third party licenses, services agreements or any hardware owned or used by CNO
or any Service Providers in connection with the provision of the Services by
reason of such use.



ARTICLE VII

TERM AND TERMINATION



Section 7.01. Term.

(a)The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and end on
the second anniversary of the Closing Date (such period, the "Term");
provided, however, that the Term may terminate earlier upon mutual consent of
the Parties or as set forth in Section 7.02 below; and provided further, that
all Services provided hereunder other than those set forth in Section 7.03
herein shall terminate on or prior to June 30, 2015 (the "Target Conversion
Completion Date") or if Wilton Re requests additional time to complete the
conversion contemplated hereunder, then Wilton Re shall be entitled to the
Extension Period as set below. The date on which this Agreement terminates
pursuant to the completion of the conversion contemplated hereunder is
referred to herein as the "Conversion Completion Date."

(b)In the event Wilton Re has not completed the conversion contemplated
hereunder by the Target Conversion Completion Date, Wilton Re shall be
entitled to a one-time extension period of up to ninety (90) days as measured
from the Target Conversion Completion Date (the "Extension Period"); provided
that Wilton Re shall deliver to CNO Wilton Re\'s request for the Extension
Period in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the Target Conversion
Completion Date. If Wilton Re requests the Extension Period, Wilton Re shall
pay CNO a monthly fee of $150,000 (pro-rated as appropriate considering the



11 Conversion Completion Date) in addition to any Fees set forth in Section 2.01
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Conversion Support
Services extend beyond September 30, 2015.



Section 7.02. Termination Upon Force Majeure. If a Force Majeure Event (as
defined in Section 11.02 herein) causes a material failure or delay in the
performance of any Services for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, Wilton
Re may, at its sole option, immediately terminate this Agreement without
liability to CNO other than liability for payment of unpaid invoices or for
services previously rendered and without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies than accrued or available.



Section 7.03. Effect of Termination.

(a)Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VII shall not affect
the Parties' obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Agreements. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the occurrence of a
Conversion Completion Date pursuant to Section 7.01(a) alter Wilton Re's
obligation to pay the Policy Fee in accordance with its terms until the end of
the originally contemplated Term.

(b)Upon the earlier of the occurrence of the Conversion Completion Date or any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to pursuant to this Article VII, Wilton
Re shall assume administration of all Insurance Contracts and, for a period of
one year thereafter (the "Termination Assistance Period"), CNO will, upon the
request of Wilton Re, at its own cost and expense, meet with Wilton Re
personnel and use commercially reasonable efforts to discuss and consult
regarding support of administrative services with respect to the Insurance
Contracts through (i) access to CNO's operational and technology personnel
familiar with the CNO systems and operational support for the Business, (ii)
access to retained Books and Records (other than such previously delivered
Books and Records no longer retained by CNO in accordance with the provisions
of the Stock Purchase Agreement and this Agreement or created for CLIC in the
course of performing the Transition Services by CNO and, as practicable by
application of commercially reasonable efforts, any of its delagees or third
party administrators) in the form and format retained by CNO or its delagee or
third party administrators. To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing,
following termination of this Agreement (x) each Party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, as soon as practicable, return to the other Party any
equipment and other property of the other Party, its Affiliates and their
respective Service Providers that is in the Party's or its Affiliates'
possession or control (and, in case of termination of a specific Service, only
the equipment and other property that is used in connection with the provision
or receipt of such Services); and (y) the license granted by the second
sentence of Section 6.01(a) herein shall terminate (and, in case of
termination of a specific Service, only to the extent such license was
necessary for the provision or receipt of such Service).



Section 7.04. Survival. Section 8.01, Article IX and Article XII shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.



ARTICLE VIII

CONFIDENTIALITY; SYSTEM SECURITY



Section 8.01. Confidentiality. CNO and Wilton Re shall keep any and all
information relating to the terms, conditions and the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Transition Services, and Conversion
Support Services confidential in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement. All information disclosed in connection with the provision
and receipt of Services



12 shall be deemed confidential information (as defined in the Stock Purchase
Agreement), except as may be necessary for the performance of the Parties'
respective obligations under this Agreement.



Section 8.02. Systems Access and Security.

(a)To the extent that Wilton Re and its Affiliates may reasonably require
access to the computer system(s), infrastructure, databases, software,
facilities or networks ("Systems") of CNO, CNO's Affiliates that are not
Service Providers, or Service Providers, and that such access is not
prohibited by an agreement between CNO, CNO's Affiliates or a Service Provider
and a third-party, Wilton Re shall request such access in writing. CNO shall
promptly respond to Wilton Re's request and shall provide reasonable access to
Wilton Re which access shall, in any event, be limited to use in connection
with performance or receipt of the Transition Services and/or Conversion
Support Services. Wilton Re shall cause its personnel and any personnel of its
Affiliates with such access to comply with the system security policies in
effect at the time of such access with regard to such Systems or in any
applicable license agreement or lease agreement in effect with regard to such
Systems (the "Security Regulations"), and will not compromise or circumvent
any security or audit measures employed by CNO, its Affiliates, or any Service
Provider, as applicable.

(b)Wilton Re shall be liable for actions of it, its Affiliates, agents and
contractors and all of its personnel gaining access to Systems of CNO or CNO's
Affiliates for any Loss (as defined in Section 9.01 herein) incurred by CNO or
CNO's Affiliates or any Service Provider by reason of unauthorized
destruction, alteration or loss of information contained therein as a result
of the actions of such personnel. Other than as specifically permitted under
Section 8.02(a) above, Wilton Re and its Affiliates shall have no rights of
access to any of CNO's, CNO's Affiliates' or any Service Providers' Systems.
The rights of access to the Systems that may be granted, at CNO's sole
discretion, to Wilton Re's and its Affiliates' personnel hereunder shall be
restricted to user access only and shall not include privileged or higher
level access rights or to functionality of the Systems normally restricted to
operations or development staff.

(c)Wilton Re shall cooperate and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully
and in a timely way with any investigation relating to the security of Systems
arising in connection with this Agreement that is carried out by or on behalf
of CNO, any of CNO's Affiliates, or any Service Provider (each, an "Affected
Entity"), including providing any relevant information or material in their
possession or under their control and responding, once during the Term, to
CNO's risk evaluation audit. If at any time Wilton Re or any of its Affiliates
determine that any user under their control or within their responsibility has
sought to circumvent or has circumvented the applicable Security Regulations,
or that an unauthorized Person has accessed or may access an Affected Entity's
Systems, Wilton Re shall immediately terminate or cause the applicable
Affiliate to immediately terminate any such Person's access to the applicable
Systems and shall immediately notify the appropriate Affected Entity of such
access or activities and such termination. If at any time an Affected Entity
determines that any of Wilton Re's or Wilton Re's Affiliates' users has sought
to circumvent or has circumvented its Security Regulations, or that an
unauthorized Person has accessed or may access its Systems, or that a Person
has engaged in activities that may lead to the unauthorized access,
destruction or alteration or loss of data, information or software, such
Affected Entity may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate any such
Person's access to the applicable Systems, and shall notify Wilton Re of such
access or activities and such termination. In addition, in the event of
failure by Wilton Re or its Affiliates to comply with the applicable Security
Regulations, CNO or the applicable Service Provider shall notify Wilton Re of
such failure and the Parties shall work together using commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly rectify and mitigate such failure. The Service
Coordinators shall be advised promptly in writing of the failure and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to work together to rectify said
failure.



13 Wilton Re shall permit and shall cause its Affiliates to permit the Affected
Entity to audit Wilton Re's and Wilton Re's Affiliates' use of its Systems and
Wilton Re's and Wilton Re's Affiliates' compliance with such Affected Entity's
Security Regulations.

(d)In the event that a Party discovers a security breach that has resulted or
may reasonably result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of, or have any
material adverse affect on, the security of any Insurance Contract customer
confidential information ("Customer Information") related to the Business, or
would require a breach notification to an Insurance Contract customer under
Applicable Law (a "Security Incident") such Party shall (i) within forty-eight
(48) hours, notify the other Party of such Security Incident and (ii) take all
measures reasonably necessary to restore the security of such Customer
Information and, in the case of a Security Incident requiring notice to the
other Party pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, consult with the other
Party with respect to such measures. Wilton Re shall have the exclusive right
to provide notice of any Security Incident to any Insurance Contract
customers, any law enforcement Person or any other Governmental Authority and
to determine the content and timing of any such notice; provided, however,
that any such notice shall be subject to review by CNO. CNO shall be
responsible for ensuring such notices are provided in a timely manner as
directed by Wilton Re.



ARTICLE IX

INDEMNITY



Section 9.01. Indemnification of CNO and Service Providers. Wilton Re hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (as an "Indemnifying Party") CNO
and Service Providers, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, successors, agents and representatives other than Producers who
are not employees of CNO or their Affiliates (in such context, each, an
"Indemnified Party"), from and against any liabilities, damages, awards,
settlements, losses, claims and expenses (including the costs and expenses of
investigating and defending any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
investigations, assessments, judgments, settlements and compromises relating
thereto and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in connection therewith)
(each, a "Loss") arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the extent
it results from or is based upon (a) CNO or its Service Provider's performance
of any Services related to any change to Non-Guaranteed Elements effected
after the Closing Date; or (b) any third party claim based on CNO's
performance of the Services on behalf or for the benefit of CLIC (except in
the case of this subsection (b) to the extent of CNO's fraud, gross negligence
or willful misconduct in providing such Services). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the rights set forth in this Section 9.01 are non-exclusive and
nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of any other rights or remedies a
Party may have under Applicable Law, whether at law or in equity, with respect
to any breach of this Agreement.



Section 9.02. Indemnification of Wilton Re. CNO hereby agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (as an "Indemnifying Party") Wilton Re and its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, successors, agents and
representatives other than non-employee producers (in such context, each, an
"Indemnified Party"), from and against any Loss arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, to the extent it results from or is based upon any third party
claim that the performance of Transition Services or Conversion Support
Services, or Wilton Re's or its Affiliates' use or receipt of Transition
Services or Conversion Support Services as contemplated by this Agreement, or
Wilton Re's or its Affiliates' exercise of the rights granted to Wilton Re or
its Affiliates hereunder infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates or
conflicts with any third party intellectual property rights (each, an
"Infringement Claim"); provided that such indemnity shall not apply to the
extent any alleged infringement occurs as a result of any Special Project
Services or any combination of the Transition Services or Conversion Support



14 Services with the services, methods, or devices of any third-party requested
by Wilton Re. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights set forth in this
Section 9.02 are non-exclusive and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of
any other rights or remedies a Party may have under Applicable Law, whether at
law or in equity, with respect to any breach of this Agreement.



Section 9.03. Claims Process.

(a)The procedure for asserting rights and claims under this Article IX shall
conform in all respects to the provisions of Article VII of the Stock Purchase
Agreement except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Stock
Purchase Agreement:

(i)indemnity rights provided in this Article IX shall survive termination of
this Agreement; and

(ii)the amount of any Loss or other liability for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement shall be net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss or other liability.



Section 9.04. Disclaimer of Warranties. ALL TRANSITION SERVICES, AND
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, AND ITEMS OF WORK PRODUCT, PLAN MATERIALS, DATA, SOFTWARE
OR HARDWARE USED OR PROVIDED HEREUNDER ARE USED OR PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
ARE MADE OR CREATED AMONG THE PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-ABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY TRANSITION SERVICES, COOPERATIVE EFFORTS, WORK
PRODUCT, DATA, SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE USED OR PROVIDED HEREUNDER, INCLUDING
WARRANTIES AS TO THE OPERABILITY OF ANY WORK PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE, OR THAT WORK
PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR WARRANTIES
ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR TRADE USAGE.
NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 9.04 SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHTS OF WILTON RE UNDER THE
STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT.



Section 9.05. Limitations. EXCEPT FOR THE CASE OF FRAUD AND WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST
PROFITS OR LOST REVENUES THAT THE OTHER PARTY MAY INCUR BY REASON OF ITS
HAVING ENTERED INTO OR RELIED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
OF THE TRANSITION SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER OR THE FAILURE THEREOF.



ARTICLE X

GENERAL COOPERATION

Section 10.01. Cooperation.

(a)Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, as reasonably requested,
in developing and meeting the requirements of the transition and conversion
plans agreed in writing (including the Project Output Documents), and shall,
among other things, provide the Services in accordance with the Performance
Standard. CNO and Service Providers will make appropriate personnel available,
pursuant to Sections 1.04(f) and 1.07 hereto to provide the Services
hereunder.



15 (b)Wilton Re shall use, and where applicable shall cause CLIC to (i) cooperate
with CNO or the Service Provider regarding the provision of any Service and
(ii) enable CNO or the Service Provider to provide such Service in accordance
with this Agreement. The failure of the Wilton Re or CLIC to comply with this
provision with respect to a Service in a way that prevents or materially
hinders CNO or the Service Provider from providing such Service in accordance
with the Performance Standards in Section 1.03 shall excuse CNO or the Service
Provider from providing such Service until such failure has been cured.



ARTICLE XI

FORCE MAJEURE



Section 11.01. General. Subject to Section 11.02 below, neither Party shall be
liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations (other
than payment obligations) under this Agreement to the extent such failure or
delay both:

(a)is caused by any of the following: acts of war, terrorism, civil riots or
rebellions; quarantines, embargoes and other similar unusual government
action; extraordinary elements of nature or acts of God; and

(b)could not have been prevented by the non-performing Party's reasonable
precautions or commercially accepted processes, or could not reasonably be
circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of substitute
services, alternate sources, work around plans or other means by which the
requirements of Wilton Re for services substantially similar to the Services
hereunder would be satisfied.



Section 11.02. Definition. Events meeting both of the criteria set forth in
Section 11.01(a) and 11.01(b) above are referred to individually and
collectively as "Force Majeure Events." The Parties expressly acknowledge that
Force Majeure Events do not include vandalism, the regulatory acts of
Governmental Authorities, labor strikes, or the non-performance by third
parties or Subcontractors relied on for the delivery of the Transition
Services, unless such failure or non-performance by a third party or
Subcontractor is itself caused by a Force Majeure Event.



Section 11.03. Excuse of Performance. Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure
Event, the non-performing Party shall be excused from any further performance
of the affected obligation(s) (other than payment obligations) for so long as
such circumstances prevail, provided that such Party continues to attempt to
recommence performance to the greatest extent possible without delay.



ARTICLE XII

Section 12.02. Entire Agreement; Severability.

(a)This Agreement (including the Stock Purchase Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements, any other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby,
and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto) contains the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, with respect thereto.



17 

(b)If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under any present or future law or if determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, and if the rights or obligations
of CNO, Service Providers or Wilton Re under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be fully
severable, and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this
Agreement and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.



Section 12.03. Waivers and Amendments; Remedies. This Agreement may be
amended, superseded, canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may
be waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties or, in
the case of a waiver, by the Party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of
any Party on exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, or shall any waiver on the part of any Party of any
right, power or privilege, or any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided are cumulative and, unless provided otherwise in this
Agreement, are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party may
otherwise have at law or in equity.



Section 12.04. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.



Section 12.05. Arbitration.

(a)Except as provided in Section 12.14 below, any disputes subject to or
relating to or in connection with this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any dispute regarding the validity, termination, performance or
breach of this Agreement, or any statutory claims relating hereto
(collectively, "Dispute"), shall be finally settled by arbitration
administered by the AIDA Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society
("ARIAS"). The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the ARIAS
Practice Guide in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be
modified herein or by agreement of the parties to the arbitration.

(b)To initiate arbitration, a Party shall send a notice demanding arbitration
to the other Party at the address specified in Section 12.01 above (the
"Arbitration Demand"). The Arbitration Demand shall be sent simultaneously by
any two (2) of the following methods to the other Party: Federal Express
courier, facsimile transmission, e-mail and certified mail, return receipt
requested.

(c)The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York.

(d)The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators (individually,
an "Arbitrator" and, collectively, the "Arbitration Panel"), each of whom
shall be (i) a disinterested, neutral current or former executive officer of a
life insurance or reinsurance company or (ii) professionals with no less than
twenty years of experience serving the life insurance or reinsurance industry
other than the Parties to this Agreement or their Affiliates. The Parties
shall each appoint one (1) Arbitrator, and the third (3rd) Arbitrator shall be
agreed upon by both Parties, within thirty (30) days following the transmittal
of the Arbitration Demand. If either Party fails to appoint an Arbitrator, or
the Parties are unable to agree upon the third Arbitrator, within the time
frame specified herein, then the President of the ARIAS shall appoint such
Arbitrators.



18 

(e)Once the Arbitration Panel is formed, each Party to the arbitration agrees
to disclose immediately to the other Party all documents in its control
pertaining to any of the Dispute(s) at issue or as directed by the Arbitration
Panel. Each Party to the arbitration shall have the right to promptly obtain
written interrogatories from, and depositions of, any persons possessing
knowledge or cognizance of the facts relevant to the Dispute(s) at issue or as
directed by the Arbitration Panel.

(f)The Parties agree that they shall use, and they shall direct the
Arbitration Panel to use, best efforts to ensure compliance with the following
timetable: (i) the length of time from the initiation of arbitration to the
final award rendered by the Arbitration Panel shall be no longer than six (6)
months; (ii) no longer than thirty (30) days shall transpire between the
service of the Arbitration Demand and appointment of the Arbitrators; (iii)
document disclosures and production of witness interrogatories and depositions
shall be completed within ninety (90) days after the Arbitrators are
appointed; (iv) the presentation of the case to the Arbitration Panel shall
continue for no more than five (5) days; and (v) the Arbitration Panel shall
reach a decision and render an award no longer than thirty (30) days after the
presentation of the case is concluded. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth above, any award rendered shall not be invalidated or
otherwise rendered ineffective as a result of any failure to comply with any
component of the above timetable.

(g)The Arbitration Panel will not be bound by formal rules of legal procedure.
Insofar as not in conflict with the express terms of this Agreement, it is the
intention of the Parties that customs and practices of the life and
reinsurance industries may be considered by the panel in resolving any
ambiguities inherent in this Agreement (in the absence of any such ambiguity,
the express terms of this Agreement shall control). The award rendered by the
Arbitration Panel shall be in the form of a written, reasoned opinion and
shall be final and binding on the Parties to the arbitration. The award shall
not be appealable to the Arbitration Panel nor in a court of law, except to
the extent provided under Sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C.A §§ 1-14. In no event shall any award include (i) special, indirect,
consequential, exemplary, lost profits, punitive or similar damages (except to
the extent permitted by Section 9.05) or (ii) any other form of relief in
excess of or inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Judgment on
the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(h)Each Party shall bear its own expenses, including attorney's fees, in
connection with any arbitration proceeding initiated hereunder. Each Party to
the arbitration shall be responsible for the Arbitration Panel's fees and
costs, including those of the Arbitrators, in the same proportion as (i) the
aggregate dollar amount of items submitted to the Arbitration Panel that are
unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Arbitration Panel) bears or (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items
so submitted.

(i)In order to enhance the efficiency of resolving disputes between the
respective parties, where such disputes include common facts or the
possibility of inconsistent, mutually exclusive results, for any dispute
arising out of, or relating to, the formation, interpretation, performance, or
breach of this Agreement which also relate or arises from the performance of
one or more obligations under or with respect to the Stock Purchase Agreement
or one or more of the Transaction Agreements, the Parties consent to joinder
of any dispute or other matter in question with respect to this Agreement and
any other such agreement, including consenting to the forum and venue of such
dispute resolution proceedings.

Section 12.06. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives. Unless otherwise provided herein,
no right or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party (in



19 whole or in part and by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties hereto; provided, however, that CNO
expressly consents to the assignment by operation of law that may result from
the merger of CLIC with and into Wilton Re, the possibility of which is
contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement.



Section 12.07. Interpretation.

(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no term or
condition of this Agreement shall be construed to supersede, restrict or
otherwise limit any term or condition set forth in the Reinsurance Agreements.

(b)For purposes of this Agreement, the words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and
other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Whenever the singular is used herein, the same shall
include the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein, the same shall
include the singular, where appropriate.



Section 12.08. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to give any Person other than the Parties
hereto, their successors and permitted assigns (including, but not limited to,
Insurance Contract customers, producers and employees of CNO) except
indemnified persons, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.



Section 12.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the
Parties hereto.



Section 12.10. Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 12.11. Dollar References. All dollar references in this Agreement are
to the currency of the United States.



Section 12.12. Performance Following Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties hereto which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Closing including, but not
limited to, any covenant or agreement contained in the Stock Purchase
Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements.



Section 12.13. No Prejudice. The Parties agree that this Agreement have been
jointly negotiated and drafted by the Parties hereto and that the terms hereof
shall not be construed in favor of or against any Party on account of its
participation in such negotiations and drafting.



Section 12.14. Equitable Relief. Either Party shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including without limitation, an injunction and/or specific
performance as a remedy for non-performance or breach hereunder. Each Party
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court of general and competent jurisdiction located within the City or County
of New York, State of New York, with respect to any action or proceeding
seeking such relief.



20 

Section 12.15. Further Assurances. Without limiting any provision of this
Agreement, each Party shall cooperate with the other in all commercially
reasonable respects in order to accomplish the objectives of this Agreement.
