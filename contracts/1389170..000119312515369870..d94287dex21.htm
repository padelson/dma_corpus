Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., 1001 Fannin, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00

place, date and time as the Partnership and Parent shall agree. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 2.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Partnership and Parent will cause a certificate of merger,
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Partnership
Agreement, the DRULPA and the DLLCA (the

of the State of Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the
Partnership and Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "

ARTICLE III

 

 _Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures_

 

Section 3.1. _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership, the Partnership GP
or any holder of Parent securities or Partnership securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section 3.1(c)_, _Section
3.2(h)_ and _Section 3.4_, each Common Unit issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.62 of a Parent Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ " and such
fraction of a Parent Share, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), which Parent Shares
will be duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable Laws,
subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.4_.

 

(b) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The limited liability company interests in Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into a number of Common Units of the Surviving Entity equal to the
number of Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, and Parent or its designated
Affiliate (which will be the sole member of Merger Sub or another designated
Affiliate of Parent) shall be admitted as, or continue as, a limited partner
of the Partnership. At the Effective Time, the books and records of the
Partnership shall be revised to reflect the conversion of all Common Units
held by Persons other than the Partnership GP, Parent and any Subsidiaries of
Parent, and the Partnership (as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without
dissolution.

 



11 (c) _Treatment of Partnership Owned Units and Parent Owned Partnership
Interests_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, all Common Units that are owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Partnership or its Subsidiaries shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such canceled Common Units. All Partnership Interests that are
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Partnership GP, Parent or
any Subsidiaries of Parent shall remain outstanding as Partnership Interests
in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by the Merger.

(d) _Treatment of Series A Preferred Units_. Each Series A Preferred Unit
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
at the Effective Time, continue to be issued and outstanding and to represent
a limited partner interest in the Partnership.

 

(e) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a " _Certificate_ ") or
non-certificated Common Units represented in book-entry form immediately prior
to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.2(g)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.2(h)_, in each case to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, without interest.

 

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units for
the Merger Consideration and paying any dividends or other distributions to
which a holder of Common Units is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(g) and any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(h). As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of record of Common Units as of the Effective Time whose Common Units
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that, with respect to certificated Common
Units, the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_) to the Exchange Agent) in such
customary forms as the Partnership and Parent may reasonably agree,
including, as applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to
_Section 3.2(i)_) and Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.2(g)_).

 

(b) _Deposit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Common Units

 



12  whose Common Units are converting into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, Parent Shares (which shares shall be
uncertificated and registered in book-entry form), payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to
_Section 3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry
Units pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash or other consideration as applicable sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to  _Section 3.2(g)_
and any Parent Shares or cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_, in each case, that may be payable from time to
time following the Effective Time. All Parent Shares and cash or other
consideration payable in respect of any dividends or distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.2(g)_ deposited with the Exchange Agent or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares as such holders have the right to receive pursuant to 
_Section 3.2(h)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
delivered by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this
_Article III_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to pay such Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

(c)  _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon delivery to the Exchange
Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section
3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry Units and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent
(including with respect to Book-Entry Units), will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the number of Parent Shares representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right
to receive in accordance with the provisions of this _Article III_, (ii) a
check in the amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 3.2(h)_ and (iii) such dividends or other distributions as such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_. Any and all
Parent Shares delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be
uncertificated and shall be registered in book-entry form. The Merger
Consideration and such other amounts as reflected in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or
any applicable documentation with respect to the surrender of Book-Entry
Units, and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Units. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate and Book-Entry Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and such
other amounts as contemplated by _Section 3.2(g)_ and _Section 3.2(h)_.

 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Unit is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or

 



13  shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result
of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of
Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Units representing Common Units converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Units are presented
to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article III_.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration nine (9) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged his, her or its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration, the payment of cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and the
payment of any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(g)_ in respect of such holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Partnership shall not be liable to any
holder of Common Units for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Shares issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Units until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section 3.2_. Following
such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable
Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the Parent
Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such
Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions in respect of

 



14  Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractions of a Parent Share will be issued upon
the surrender of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, and such fractional interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account all Common Units
exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii) the
fraction of a Parent Share that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that payment of such
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Shares was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Shares. 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_ and pay cash in lieu
of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding
is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in cash or Parent
Common Stock, as determined by Parent). To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of the Common Units in respect of whom such withholding was
made. If withholding is taken in Parent Shares, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal
to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed
sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

 



15 Section 3.3. _Treatment of Partnership Equity Awards, Partnership Equity Plan
and Parent Equity Awards_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time, the GP Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee of the GP Board designated under the Partnership Long-Term Incentive
Plan to serve as the plans administrative committee) and the Parent Board,
the Compensation Committee of the Parent Board or any other committee of the
Parent Board designated by the Parent Board will adopt joint resolutions, and
the Partnership and the Parent will take or cause to be taken all other
actions as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and
the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plan (including, the award agreements in
respect of awards granted thereunder) to give effect to this _Section 3.3_
and provide that each right to receive Common Units subject to forfeiture
or vesting requirements granted under the Partnership Long-Term Incentive
Plan (each, a " _Partnership Equity Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted and
restated into the right to receive a comparable Parent equity award (a "
_Parent Equity Award_ "), with respect to Parent Shares. Each unvested right
to acquire Common Units subject to a Partnership Equity Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, be converted and restated into the right to receive Parent Shares
pursuant to a Parent Equity Award which (i) covers a number of Parent Shares
based on the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Share,
and (ii) includes the same vesting, forfeiture and termination rights as
included in the Partnership Equity Award; provided, however, that the Parent
Board, the Compensation Committee of the Parent Board or any other committee
of the Parent Board designated by the Parent Board shall evaluate and may
approve revisions to the performance vesting aspects of the
underlying Partnership Equity Awards (which are based on performance of the
Partnership) and may make determinations concerning replicating, replacing or
eliminating such performance vesting aspects in the applicable Parent Equity
Awards (the " _Performance Vesting Determination_ "). The agreements between
the Partnership GP and each award holder regarding such Partnership Equity
Awards shall be assumed by Parent, and such awards, as converted pursuant to
this  _Section 3.3(a)_, shall continue to be governed, on and after the
Effective Time, by the terms and conditions of such agreements (subject to the
adjustments required by this _Section 3.3(a)_ after giving effect to the
Merger) and by the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plan, as adopted by the
Parent. Except to the extent provided in _Section 3.3(b)_ below, as of the
Effective Time, such Partnership Equity Awards shall cease to represent the
right to receive Common Units.

(b) To the extent applicable, holders of Partnership Equity Awards immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall have continued rights to any distribution,
without interest, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable award agreements between the GP and each such holder (including
pursuant to any distribution equivalent rights) with respect to
such Partnership Equity Awards with a record date occurring prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Partnership with
respect to Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
which remains unpaid as of the Effective Time. Such distributions shall be
paid on the payment date as set therefor to such holders of Partnership Equity
Awards, subject to any vesting conditions included in the Partnership Equity
Awards.

 



16 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board or its compensation
committee shall adopt the Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plan as of the
Effective Time, authorize the conversion and restatement of Partnership Equity
Awards into Parent Equity Awards, in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_ at the
Effective Time and shall take all other actions as may be necessary to
authorize the events contemplated in _Section 3.3(a)_; such actions shall
include the following: (i) effective as of the Effective Time, the Partnership
Long-Term Incentive Plan shall be continued by Parent, and all Partnership

right of termination or cancellation under, give rise to a right to receive a
change of control payment (or similar payment) under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the

any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract or Parent Permit to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or (iii)
result in the exercisability of any right to purchase or acquire any material
asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of _clause
(ii)_, for such violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or Liens that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

or represented by proxy at the Parent Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof and entitled to vote on the Parent Stock Issuance to

case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) in
respect of Parent, the definition set forth in the foregoing clause (A),
substituting all references to the Partnership with "Parent" and all
references to Parent with "the

 



45  Partnership." Notwithstanding the foregoing, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "
in respect of Parent shall not include any inquiry, proposal or offer that
would not reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially impede,

materially adversely affect the economic benefits to be obtained by the
holders of Common Units upon the consummation of the Merger.

the Partnership or assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions
which the GP Conflicts Committee determines in its good faith to be more
favorable to the Limited Partners from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement that as of the time of determination had been
committed to by Parent in writing, and (B) in respect of Parent, a bona fide
written offer, obtained after the date of this Agreement and not in material
breach of this _Section 6.3_, to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than

taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of the
time of determination had been committed to by the Partnership in writing.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the GP
Board or the GP Conflicts Committee or shall prevent Parent or the Parent
Board, as applicable, from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal
if the GP Conflicts Committee or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that its failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Partnership Adverse Recommendation
Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance
with _Section 6.3(c)_ or _Section 6.3(g)_, as the case may be.

 



46 Section 6.4. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, on the one

Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of Parent until the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, voting or causing to be
voted all Common Units beneficially owned by Parent in favor of the Merger at

petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any

Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless a later date is
mutually agreed to by the parties hereto) and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions
consistent with this  _Section 6.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).

 

Section 6.5. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Partnership. Thereafter, neither the
Partnership nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued
or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by any applicable
listing agreement with the NYSE or other national securities exchange as
determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such
release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other party); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Partnership
nor Parent shall be required by this  _Section 6.5_ to consult

 



47  with any other party with respect to a public announcement in connection
with a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, but nothing in this proviso shall limit
the obligations of the Partnership, the Partnership GP, the GP Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee or of Parent or the Parent Board, as applicable, under
_Section 6.3_; _provided_ , _further_ , that each party and their respective
controlled affiliates may make statements that are consistent with statements
made in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
by Parent or the Partnership in compliance with this  _Section 6.5_.

Section 6.6. _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable advance notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each
party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to afford to the other
party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
(and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy) to all of its and
its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives.

Section 6.7. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that the
Partnership or the Partnership GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would
be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified Person immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to
(i) indemnify and hold harmless against any cost or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Proceeding, and provide advancement of expenses with respect to
each of the foregoing to, all Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions regarding
elimination of liability of officers and directors, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in
the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the Organizational
Documents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP or any of their
respective successors or assigns, if applicable, shall, for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the
Partnership and the Partnership GP than are presently set forth in such
Organizational Documents. Any right of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(a)_ shall not be amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise
modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of
such Indemnified Person as provided herein, and shall be enforceable by such
Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and representatives against
Parent and the Partnership GP and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time
Parents current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons);
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by Parent for such

 



48  insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso
to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent would be required to expend more
than the Maximum Amount, Parent shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If Parent in its sole
discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent under this
_Section 6.7(b)_, Parent may (but shall be under no obligation to), prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in
their capacity as such.

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.7_ shall
be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP, any
indemnification agreements, or the DLLCA and DRULPA. The provisions of this
_Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for a period of six (6) years and are expressly
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs
and representatives;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section
6.7_ are asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the
Partnership GP, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or
the Partnership GP shall assume the obligations of Parent and the Partnership
GP set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8.  _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be the obligation of the
respective party incurring such fees and expenses, except Parent and the
Partnership shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in
connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Registration
Statement and Proxy Statements.

Section 6.9. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Partnership shall take all such steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common
Units (including derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

issued pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement to be approved for

Section 6.11. _Dividends and Distributions_. After the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Partnership shall coordinate
with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends or distributions in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Partnership Interests and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
that holders of Partnership Interests shall not receive, for any quarter,
distributions both in respect of Partnership Interests and also dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the
Merger, but that they shall receive for any such quarter either: (a) only
distributions in respect of Partnership Interests or (b) only dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the
Merger.

 

Section 6.12. _GP Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not and it shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall not and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action intended to cause the Partnership GP
to, without the consent of a majority of the then existing members of the GP
Conflicts Committee, eliminate the GP Conflicts Committee, revoke or diminish
the authority of the GP Conflicts Committee or remove or cause the removal of
any director of the Partnership GP that is a member of the GP Conflicts
Committee either as a director or as a member of such committee. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.12_ shall not apply to the filling, in
accordance with the provisions of the Partnership GP LLC Agreement, of any
vacancies caused by the resignation, death or incapacity of any such
director.

Section 6.13. _Performance by Partnership GP_. The Partnership GP shall cause
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
actions or inactions by the Partnership and the Partnership GP and their
respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be breaches or violations or
failures to perform by Parent or its Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of
this Agreement unless such action or inaction was or was not taken at the
direction of or on the recommendation of, or with respect to the Partnership
and the Partnership GP and their respective Subsidiaries and subject to
_Section 6.2(b)_, with the consent of, Parent.

 

Section 6.14. _Cooperation with Debt and Equity Financing_. From and after the
date of this Agreement, the Partnership shall, and the Partnership shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to provide all customary cooperation
(including providing reasonably available financial and other information
regarding the Partnership and its Subsidiaries for use in marketing and
offering documents and to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial
statements) as reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the
arrangement of any bank debt financing or any capital markets debt or equity
financing, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement
or required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger.

 



50 Section 6.15. _Tax Treatment_. For United States federal income tax purposes
(and for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows
the United States federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat
the Merger (a) with respect to the holders of Common Units (other than Common
Units held by Parent and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time), as a taxable sale of such Common Units to Targa GP Inc. (the sole
member of Merger Sub) and (b) with respect to Targa GP Inc., as a purchase of
Common Units (other than Common Units held by Parent and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time) from the holders of such units. The
parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the
course of any Proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law following a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final
administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Section 6.16. _Takeover Statutes_. Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or related thereto. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or related thereto, Parent and the Parent
Board shall grant such approvals and shall use reasonable best efforts to
take such actions so that the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable
best efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or

pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (No Parent Stockholder
Approval), Parent shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated Affiliate)
an amount equal to the Partnership Expenses, and such payment shall be made
within two (2) Business Days after such termination.

 

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (No Partnership
Unitholder Approval), the Partnership shall pay to the Parent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (to an account designated by the Parent), an
amount equal to the Parent Expenses, and such payment shall be made within
two (2) Business Days after such termination.

(c) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_ (Parent Superior Proposal), Parent shall, concurrently with such
termination, execute an amendment to the Partnership Agreement providing for
the reduction in distributions payable by the Partnership to the holders
of the Incentive Distribution Rights as set forth on Section 8.3(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule equal to the Partnership Termination Amount, and
Parent hereby does consent to such amendment and agrees to cause any of its
Subsidiaries that are required to consent to such amendment to do so.

(d) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Proposal is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ (Parent Recommendation Change) and (iii) at any time
on or prior to the 6-month anniversary of such termination, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into a definitive agreement in respect of an
Alternative Proposal or consummated an Alternative Proposal, Parent shall,
concurrently with the earlier of entering into such definitive agreement and
consummating such Alternative Proposal, execute an amendment to the
Partnership Agreement providing for the reduction in distributions payable by
the Partnership to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights as set
forth on Section 8.3(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule equal to the
Partnership Termination Amount, and Parent hereby does consent to such
amendment and agrees to cause any of its Subsidiaries that are required
to consent to such amendment to do so. For purposes of this _Section
8.3(d)_, the term " _Alternative Proposal_ " has the meaning assigned to such
term in _Section 6.3(h)_, except that references to "thirty-five percent
(35%) or more" or "at least thirty-five percent (35%)" are deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%) or more" or "at least fifty percent (50%),"
respectively.

 

(e) In no event shall Parent be required to make the amendment with respect to
the Partnership Termination Amount on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Parent has previously paid the Partnership Expenses to the
Partnership (or its designated Affiliate) pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, any
Partnership Termination Amount subject to _Section 8.3(c)_ or _Section
8.3(d)_ shall be reduced by the amount of the Partnership Expenses previously
paid.

(f) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ (Partnership Superior Proposal), the Partnership shall
pay to Parent the Parent Termination Fee concurrently with such termination.

 



56 (g) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Proposal is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to the Partnership Unitholder
Meeting, (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ (Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change) and (iii) at
any time on or prior to the 6-month anniversary of such termination, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a definitive agreement
in respect of an Alternative Proposal or consummated an Alternative Proposal,
the Partnership shall pay to Parent the Parent Termination Fee concurrently
with the earlier of entering into such definitive agreement and consummating
such Alternative Proposal. For purposes of this _Section 8.3(g)_, the term "
_Alternative Proposal_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in _Section
6.3(h)_, except that references to "thirty-five percent (35%) or more" or "at
least thirty-five percent (35%)" are deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%) or more" or "at least fifty percent (50%)," respectively.

(h) In no event shall the Partnership be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Partnership has previously paid the Parent Expenses to Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_, any Parent Termination Fee to be paid by the Partnership
pursuant to _Section 8.3(f)_ or _Section 8.3(g)_ shall be reduced by the
amount of the Parent Expenses previously paid.

 

(i) The parties acknowledge that payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the
Parent Expenses and the Partnership Expenses, and that making the amendment
with respect to the Partnership Termination Amount, as applicable, if, as and
when required pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, shall not constitute a penalty
but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate
the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _Miscellaneous_

 

Section 9.1. _No Survival, Etc_. The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1_, as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article
I_, _Article II_, _Article III_ and the last sentence of _Section 6.6_,
_Section 6.8_ and  _Section 6.10_ and any other agreement in this Agreement
that contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the
Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2. _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and the
Parent Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by the Parent Board and the GP 

 



57  Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has first referred such action to the GP Conflicts
Committee for its consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts Committee not
less than two (2) business days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with
respect thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the GP Board shall in no way be
obligated to follow the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the
GP Board shall be permitted to take action following the expiration of such
two (2) business day period); provided, further, that following receipt of the
Partnership Unitholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, there
shall be no amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by
applicable Law or stock exchange rule would require further approval by the
Limited Partners or Parent Stockholders, as applicable, without
such approval. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
whenever a determination, decision, approval or consent of the Partnership or
Partnership GP is required pursuant to this Agreement, such determination,
decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the GP Board; provided,
however, that the GP Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it
has first referred such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for its
consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts Committee not less than two (2)
business days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with respect thereto.

Section 9.3. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, the GP Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has
first referred such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for
its consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts Committee not less than two
(2) business days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with respect
thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the GP Board shall in no way be obligated
to follow the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the GP Board
shall be permitted to take action following the expiration of such two (2)
business day period) and, following the Partnership Unitholder Approval, the
GP Board may not take or authorize any such action without the prior written
consent of the GP Conflicts Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Partnership, the Partnership GP, Parent or Merger Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 9.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this  _Section 9.4_ shall be null and void.

 



58 Section 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

 

Section 9.6. _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and any certificates delivered by any party pursuant to this
agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof
and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies
hereunder, except for, in the case of _clause (b)_, the provisions of
_Section 6.7_ and _Section 9.11_ and the right of the holders of Common
Units to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim by the
holders of Common Units with respect to which may not be made unless and
until the Closing shall have occurred). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, _Section 9.7_ and _Section 9.11_ shall be for
the benefit of, and enforceable by, any financing sources or lender providing
financing in connection with the Merger.

Section 9.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware); _provided_ , _however_ , each of the parties hereto
irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising
out of or in connection with any debt financing in connection with the Merger
shall be brought only in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable Laws exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto

 



59  irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this _Section 9.7_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.8. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 9.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 9.8_, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 9.9. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder must be
in writing and will be deemed duly given if delivered personally or by
facsimile transmission, or mailed through a nationally recognized overnight
courier or registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage
prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address

61 Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, financing source,
lender, agent, attorney, representative or affiliate of any party hereto or of
any of their respective Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party
to this Agreement) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall limit any liability of
