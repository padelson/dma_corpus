10 ARTICLE II

 

 _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

 

Section 2.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_ , Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2(a) of the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (but not later than the twentieth (20th) day from and including
the date of initial public announcement of this Agreement). The obligation of
Merger Sub to commence the Offer shall be subject only to the condition that
none of the events set forth in clause (c) of _Annex A_ hereto shall have
occurred and be continuing (and not waived by Parent or Merger Sub in their
sole discretion), and the obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment,
purchase and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent or Merger
Sub in their sole discretion (but subject to the next sentence)) of the
conditions set forth in such _Annex A_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right to waive any conditions to the Offer or change the terms of the Offer
except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub may
not waive the condition in clause (a) of _Annex A_ (the " _Minimum Condition_
") or the conditions in clause (b) of _Annex A_ , and no change in the Offer
may be made which (i) decreases the Offer Price payable in the Offer, (ii)
changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the
maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer or the minimum number of
Shares contemplated by the Minimum Condition, (iv) imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex A_ hereto or which otherwise
modifies the conditions set forth in such _Annex A_ or (v) amends any other
term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon
as practicable after the expiration of the Offer (the date of acceptance for
payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ " and the time of acceptance for payment on
the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") or (in the case of Shares
tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period) as soon as practicable
following the valid tender thereof, in any case without interest, subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law or in accordance with
_Sections 3.2(i)_. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub
on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any and all Shares
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
pursuant to the Offer.



 

11 (b) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on
the date (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") that is twenty (20) Business
Days after the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Merger Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (i) extend the Offer for one or more additional consecutive
periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days per extension (with the length of
such periods to be determined in the sole discretion of Parent consistent with
applicable Law), if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of
the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ shall not have been
satisfied or waived, and if this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , and (ii) extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer. If, at the Initial Expiration Time or
subsequent expiration time related to an extension of the Offer, including an
extension pursuant to this sentence, any of the conditions to the obligation
of Merger Sub to accept for payment, purchase and pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer has not been satisfied (or waived in accordance with
this Agreement), then, if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer through such time as the
Company may specify, which time shall be no later than the Termination Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall have any
obligation to so extend the Offer at the Companys request if either of the
conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of _Annex A_ are not at
such time satisfied in accordance with this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 2.1(b)_ shall affect or impair any termination rights under _Article
VIII_.

 

(c) If all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived, but the
number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the
Shares, if any, held by Parent and Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (any such wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Parent, Parent and Merger Sub, each a " _Parent Company_ "), constitute
less than the number of Shares required to consummate the Merger pursuant to
_Section 2.10_ (assuming the exercise of the Top-Up Option in full), then,
upon the applicable expiration time of the Offer, Merger Sub may (and if the
Company so requests Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
provide a subsequent offering period (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act and, if applicable and to
the extent permitted under such Rule 14d-11, thereafter extend such
subsequent offering period.

(d) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer, which shall include the offer to purchase, form of
the related letter of transmittal and form of notice of guaranteed delivery
and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Offer
Documents will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Merger Sub
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares as
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of
Shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the
Company and its counsel any comments or communications, whether written or
oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
Parents or Merger Subs, as the case may be, receipt of such comments or
communications. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any responses to such comments or communications, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel.

  

 

12 Section 2.2 _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the payment by
Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number
of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Companys Board of Directors as
is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Companys
Board of Directors (determined after giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates
at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment and any Top-Up Shares)
bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the
directors on the Companys Board of Directors (as long as Parent and its
Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the Shares). In furtherance thereof,
the Company shall, upon request of Parent and subject to the terms of the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, promptly take all actions
necessary to cause Parents designees to be so elected or appointed,
including, without limitation, increasing the size of its Board of Directors
and/or seeking the resignations of one or more incumbent directors. At such
times, subject to _Section 2.2(c)_ and applicable Law and regulations and the
rules of Nasdaq Global Market, Inc., the Company will cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute such number of members of each
committee of the Companys Board of Directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Companys Board of Directors, other than any committee of the Companys
Board of Directors established to take action under this Agreement which
committee shall be composed only of Continuing Directors (as defined in
_Section 2.2(c)_ ).

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Companys
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-l thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 2.2_ , including mailing to stockholders together with
the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Companys
Board of Directors. Parent shall supply to the Company, and shall be solely
responsible for, any information with respect to itself and its officers,
directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 2.2_ are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have
as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

 



 

13 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to
the Companys Board of Directors pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ then, until
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Companys Board of Directors
to maintain at least three directors who are members of the Companys Board
of Directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the
Company and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued
listing requirements of Nasdaq Global Market, Inc. (the " _Continuing
Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the number of Continuing
Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Continuing
Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate a person to fill such
vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors
shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers,
employees, stockholders or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of
this Agreement. The Company and the Companys Board of Directors shall
promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations
under this _Section 2.2(c)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or
appointed to the Companys Board of Directors and prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors shall take such action as
necessary so that the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing
Directors (or of the sole Continuing Director if there shall then be only one
Continuing Director) shall be required, and no further action of the
Companys Board of Directors shall be required, to (i) amend or terminate this
Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) extend the time for performance
of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder, (iv) take any action not
otherwise required herein or contemplated hereby that adversely affects the
rights of the Companys stockholders, or (v) take any other action by the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel
and financial advisors of their choice at the expense of the Company as
determined appropriate by the Continuing Directors for the purpose of
fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after the
Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall have received at least two (2) Business Days
prior notice of the proposed commencement of any such action. Following the
acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor Sub shall take any action to remove any
Continuing Director absent cause and subject to the terms of the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and

may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Shares. The
nondisclosure agreement, dated March 17, 2010 (as amended or supplemented,

Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ")
equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates at the time of such exercise,
shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the total Shares
then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once, in whole and not in part, on
or after the Acceptance Time (so long as the exercise of the Top-Up Option
would, after issuance of such Shares, be sufficient to allow the Short Form
Merger to occur; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up
Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the number
of authorized but unissued Shares (including as authorized and unissued
Shares, for purposes of this _Section 2.9_ , any Shares held in the treasury
of the Company) as of immediately prior to and after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares; and _provided_ _further_ , that the Top-Up
Option shall terminate upon the earlier of: (i) the tenth (10th) business day
after the later of (1) the Acceptance Time and (2) the expiration of any
Subsequent Offering Period; and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up
Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions
that (A) no provision of any applicable Law and no judgment, injunction,
order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise (excluding any rule
or regulation of Nasdaq Global Market, Inc.), (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates
constitutes one Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of Shares
that will be outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and (C) Merger Sub has accepted for payment all
Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The parties shall
cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished
consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities
(other than Nasdaq Global Market, Inc.), including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. 

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in
writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that
will be owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates immediately preceding
the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii) the place and time for the closing
of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent
and Merger Sub in writing of the number of Shares then outstanding and the
number of Top-Up Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the
Company in cash by wire transfer the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares, which certificate may include any
legends required by applicable securities Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , at
Parents election, the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Shares may be
paid (A) through (i) the payment of an amount in cash equal to the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares and (ii) the issuance of a full-recourse
promissory note by Merger Sub guaranteed by Parent in principal amount equal
to the remainder, bearing simple interest at applicable federal rate per
annum and due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing (which
promissory note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty) or (B) with any other combination of cash and such a promissory note
where the cash portion of the purchase price is not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares.



 

17 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares which Merger Sub may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon any purchase
of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, if any, are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). The parties
agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the
Dissenting Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined in accordance with
Section 262(h) of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Shares or any consideration paid or delivered by Merger Sub to the Company in
payment for the Top-Up Shares.

 

Section 2.10 _Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 6.8_ , in the event that any Parent
Company, whether pursuant to the Offer, upon exercise of the Top-Up Option or
otherwise, shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
Shares, the parties hereto agree, subject to _Article VII_ , to take all
necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of shareholders
of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL (a " _Short Form
Merger_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.9(b)_ have been satisfied, Merger Sub shall
exercise the Top-Up Option as promptly as practicable following
the Acceptance Time.

of Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting
Shares), sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration
Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ in exchange for
all outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares).
The Consideration Fund shall not be used for any other purposes.

 



 

19 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ , (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof together with any required indemnity) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which
letter of transmittal and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably
agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon
surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereof, and with such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book-
Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share
or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange present
proper evidence of transfer and pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and shall be paid to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the
Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_ , and
following any net losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
applicable holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time in the
amount of such net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part
of the Consideration Fund. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ , except as otherwise provided by
Law.

  

 

20 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the applicable former
stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with
respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any). 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the
Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which
such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this
_Article III_.

 

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

(i) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Options, Restricted Stock
Awards, RSUs or Warrants such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is or may be reasonably required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares, Options, Restricted Stock Awards, RSUs or
Warrants in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.



 

21 Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ ") granted under the
Companys 2005 Stock Plan or the Companys 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
(together with the Companys 2005 Stock Plan, the " _Equity Plans_ "), or an
Assumed Subsidiary Equity Plan and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time, shall at the Effective Time (i) in the case of an Option that
is vested as of the Effective Time (including an Option that will become
vested solely as a result of the Merger), be cancelled, and the holder of each
such Option shall be entitled to receive from the Company, as of
the Effective Time and with respect to each such Option, cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by
(B) the number of Shares covered by such Option (the aggregate amount of such
cash, the " _Option Consideration_ "), with such payment to be subject to any
applicable Tax withholding (in accordance with _Section 3.2(i)_ ), and (ii) in
the case of an Option that is not vested as of the Effective Time (other than
an Option that will become vested solely as a result of the Merger) be
converted into an option (a " _Substitute Option_ ") to purchase the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (decreased to the nearest full share)
determined by multiplying (A) the number of Shares covered by such Option, by
(B) the Equity Award Ratio, and the exercise price per share of such
Substitute Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of such Option by the Equity Award Ratio (increased to the nearest
cent). After the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 3.3(a)_,
each Substitute Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any acceleration, lapse or other vesting occurring
by operation of the Merger (either alone or in connection with any other
event). 

(b) Each restricted stock unit award with respect to a Share (an " _RSU_ ")
granted under the Equity Plans and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be adjusted and converted into a restricted stock unit (a
" _Substitute RSU_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such RSU by
the Equity Award Ratio. After the Effective Time, except as provided in this
_Section 3.3(b)_, each Substitute RSU shall be subject to the terms of such
RSU effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any
payment, calculation, acceleration, lapse, vesting or other impact occurring
by operation of the Merger (either alone or in connection with any other
event); _provided_ , _however_ , that any RSU that becomes vested solely as a
result of the Merger shall be settled at the Effective Time for an amount of
cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of Shares
subject to such RSU, subject to any applicable Tax withholding (in accordance
with  _Section 3.2(i)_).

(c) Each Warrant shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and the holder of
each Warrant shall be entitled to receive from the Company, as of the
Effective Time, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to (i) the product
of (A) the number of Shares subject to the Warrants of such holder and (B) the
Merger Consideration  _minus_ (ii) the product of (A) the number of Shares
subject to the Warrants of such holder and (B) the per share exercise price of
such Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time. All amounts payable in
respect of such Warrants pursuant to this _Section 3.3(c)_ shall be subject
to any applicable withholding of Taxes (in accordance with _Section 3.2(i)_ ).



 

22 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to Section 3.3(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all such actions, in consultation with Parent, as may be
required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_. Other than with
respect to Options described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of Section
3.3(a) and RSUs not described in the proviso in the last sentence of _Section
3.3(b)_ , no later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this _Section 3.3_.

(e) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the
holders of Substitute Options and Substitute RSUs appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Substitute Options and
Substitute RSUs, including, in addition to the same terms and conditions that
applied to such awards prior to the substitution (subject to the adjustments
required by this _Section 3.3_ after giving effect to the Merger). Parent
shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that will become subject to the Substitute Options and Substitute RSUs and
(ii) as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any
event no later than the Effective Time), prepare and file with the SEC and
use its reasonable best efforts to have declared effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 registering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents
obligations under this  _Section 3.3_ and covering the exercise of the
Substitute Options or settlement of the Substitute RSUs. Such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus
required thereby shall be maintained) for at least as long as Substitute
Options and Substitute RSUs remain outstanding.

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof, to
the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected
such holders demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with notice of any demands for appraisal of any
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any payments
required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by
Parent and the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a
stockholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Minor Plan, a true and complete copy of the following items (in each case,
only if applicable): (i) each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each
summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the

Internal Revenue Service to be revoked), or the Benefit Plan or prototype
sponsor has remaining a period of time under applicable treasury regulations
of the Code or pronouncements of the IRS in which to apply for such a letter
and make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or

Affiliate with respect to any Benefit Plan. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened audits, examinations, inquiries or
investigations by any Governmental Entity involving any Benefit Plan.



  

30 (f) Neither the Offer, the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) entitle any
current or former director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any current or former

material respects with, Section 409A of the Code and all applicable guidance
thereunder.

affect the Company or its Subsidiaries in any material respect, (i) the fair
market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability
of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance, or the
reserve shown on the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Reports for any unfunded Foreign Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the projected benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect
to all current and former participants in such plan based on reasonable,
country-specific actuarial assumptions and valuations, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations or book reserve to be less than such projected benefit
obligations, (ii) if such Foreign Benefit Plan is required to be registered,
it has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with the
applicable regulatory authorities, and (iii) if such Foreign Benefit Plan is

There has occurred no default under, or violation of, any such Permit, and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not cause the
revocation or cancellation of any such Permit, except those that have not had
or would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This  _Section 4.11(a)_

respect with, or has any material liability under, the Export Control Laws.

jurisdictions in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are operating (the "
_Anti-Bribery Laws_ "). Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written communication from any Governmental
Entity that alleges that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any agent
thereof is in material violation of, or has any material liability under, the

filed by it (in each case taking due account of lawful extensions validly
obtained), and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate in all
material respects and disclose all material Taxes required to be paid by each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby. All
material Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns have been timely paid or
have been adequately reserved against on the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP. All deficiencies asserted in writing or written
assessments made as a result of any examination of such Tax Returns have been
paid or otherwise resolved in full, or have been adequately reserved against

Subsidiaries were required by Law to withhold or collect have been duly

the appropriate governmental authority.

 

(b) The most recent Financial Statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents
reflect an adequate reserve, based on GAAP principles, for all material Taxes
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in addition to any reserve
for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between book and tax items)
for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such Financial Statements. There is no agreement or other document waiving or

transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.

 



 

33 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any

its or their respective officers, directors, employees and other
Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit or take any action to
facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries regarding or the making of
any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) except as permitted below, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information or data to, any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company may comply with its obligations under

parties to such agreements that Parent or any affiliate of Parent
participated in the Companys auction process and may waive any standstill
restrictions under nondisclosure agreements with parties that participated in
the Companys auction process to permit them to submit an Acquisition
Proposal to the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Date, in the event that the Company receives an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ , the Company and its Board of
Directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a
part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any information and
access to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
or potential sources of financing if (i) the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that such Person is reasonably likely to submit
to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal and (ii)
the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its counsel, that the failure to participate in such discussions or
negotiations or to furnish such information would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law; _provided_ that all such information so furnished has been previously
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrent with it
being so furnished to such Person or its Representatives. In addition, nothing
herein shall restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations with regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law. 



 

49 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so modify) the recommendation by the
Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof of the Offer,
the Merger or this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a customary
confidentiality agreement) or (iii) take any action to render the restrictions
on business combinations with interested stockholders set forth in Section 203
of the DGCL or any other "control share," anti-takeover or similar Law
inapplicable to any transaction included in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Board of Directors of the Company may
(i) make a Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its counsel and financial
advisor) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law or (ii) terminate this Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
that was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from
a breach of this _Section 6.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no Change
in Recommendation may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ may be made, in each case until after the
fifth (5th) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
make a Change in Recommendation (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the
basis of the proposed action by the Companys Board of Directors is a Superior
Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five (5) Business Day
period). In determining whether to make a Change in Recommendation, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise.



 

50 (d) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
person making any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent
fully informed of the status and material details (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal and any discussions and
negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material (including all draft
agreements and any comments thereon) relating to any such Acquisition Proposal
exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their
Representatives), on the one hand, and the Person making an Acquisition
Proposal (or its Representatives), on the other hand.

 

Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Surviving
Corporations employee benefit plans established following the Closing Date
(if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") following the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "), to recognize the service of each
Continuing Employee (to the extent such service was recognized by the Company)
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of
benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes) under the Post-Closing Plans.
Each Post-Closing Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the
extent waived or not applicable under a comparable Benefit Plan. Continuing
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Post-Closing Plan for
amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the
Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Post-Closing Plan.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the terms
of all Benefit Plans set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, no provision of
this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee to continued
employment by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any respective Subsidiary thereof, or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof, to
terminate the employment of any employee for any reason or (ii) require
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any respective Subsidiary
thereof, to continue any employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement
or agreement or prevent the amendment, modification, or termination thereof in
accordance with plan terms after the Closing Date.

(c) Parent and the Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Acceptance
Time shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all Benefit Plans
set forth in Section 6.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) In lieu of Options that would otherwise have been granted to the Companys
directors during fiscal year 2010, the Company may make cash payments to such
directors prior to Closing in an aggregate amount for all directors not
exceeding $50,000. To the extent not previously paid by the Company, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay bonuses with respect
to the Companys 2010 fiscal year under the bonus plans listed on Section
6.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time and at the time that such
bonus payments would otherwise have been made, and Parent shall honor such
payment terms to the extent the Company shall have accrued for such bonuses in
the forecasted financial statements Made Available to Parent.

 



 

51 (e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
adopt resolutions providing that no rights to contributions will accrue under
the Company 401(k) Plan after, and that the Company 401(k) Plan will be
terminated as of, the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
Company shall allow Parent to review such resolutions prior to their adoption
and shall cooperate with Parent to make any changes to such resolutions
reasonably requested by Parent. The Company shall take all other actions
required or reasonably advisable to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan prior
to the Closing Date (including giving notice to the administrator and trustee
of the Company 401(k) Plan), and shall consult with Parent prior to taking any
such other actions concerning the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan.

(f) This _Section 6.5_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and, except as provided for
in _Section 9.6_ , nothing in this _Section 6.5_ , express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section 6.5_ or is intended to be,
shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification or as
establishing or creating of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or
policy of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective
Subsidiary thereof.

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any
of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other
party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such
public announcements; _provided_ that the Company will no longer be required
to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any
such press release or public announcement if the Companys Board of Directors
has effected any Change in Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so.

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume the
obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at

directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification agreement between an Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a complete and accurate
copy of each such indemnification agreement has been heretofore Made Available
to Parent) (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof or as amended or
entered into prior to the Closing with the consent of Parent), without
further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitation of director liability set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

52 (b) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or
"tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6)
years from the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and
accurate copy of which has been heretofore Made Available to Parent)
(collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its
obligations under this _Section 6.7(b)_ , Parent shall not be obligated to pay
more than $575,000 in the aggregate to obtain such policy. It is understood
and agreed that in the event such a policy cannot be obtained for $575,000 or
less in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to obtain as much coverage
for not less than six years from the Effective Time as may be obtained for
such $575,000 aggregate amount.

(c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.7_.

 

(d) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives, and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and
performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and
other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

53 Section 6.8 _Company Special Meeting; Proxy Statement_. If required by
applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, in accordance
with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys
stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following Merger Subs
acceptance of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, for the purpose of
considering adopting this Agreement. In connection with the Company Special
Meeting, as soon as practicable following Merger Subs acceptance of and
payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall prepare with
Parent and file with the SEC a Proxy Statement and furnish the information
required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
DGCL and any other applicable Laws. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Proxy Statement as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable Laws.
The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any comments or
communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after receipt of such comments or communications. Parent
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
responses to such comments or communications, and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel.

Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries).

_Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (B) there has been publicly disclosed for the first time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition
Proposal (or the intention by any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal)
and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters

Fee_ "), (x) concurrently with any termination of this Agreement (in the case
of a payment required by clause (i) above) or (y) on the date of the first
to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii)(C) (in the case of a

Proposal (or intention by any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal) has been
publicly disclosed for the first time or (ii) the Company does not,
within twelve (12) months after such termination, enter into any definitive
agreement with respect to (or consummate) a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
Parents Expenses, such amount not to exceed $2,000,000, which shall be paid
(A) concurrently with Parents termination of this Agreement, in the case of
an amount payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ or (B) on the date that
is twelve (12) months after Parents termination, in the case of an amount

information in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be adequate response and disclosure of such fact, circumstance or

if it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure relates to one or more or all of such representations or
warranties. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor
shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by

the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



 

64 Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a)
expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,

State of Delaware (and of the appropriate appellate courts from any of the
foregoing courts) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any
other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware and (d) each of the parties hereto agrees that each of the
other parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for
enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other
court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of

final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

Section 9.10 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in _Section 9.9_ hereof in any such action or proceeding by
mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to _Section 9.3_ hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a
party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally
available method.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING

and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
nonbreaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not
be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of
adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel
specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted in accordance
with _Section 9.9_.

 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties

consent of the other parties, _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub may
assign in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.



 

65 Section 9.14 _Expenses_. Except as provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not

into and carrying out this Agreement (including (i) transfer, stamp and

and other or similar Taxes or fees), _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall pay any real property transfer Taxes imposed on the holders of Shares
which result from the transactions contemplated herein. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor the Company shall be responsible for
the payment of income Taxes imposed upon a holder of Shares which result from
the transactions contemplated herein.

this Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 

Section 9.16 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party

upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.
