If Closing Net Working Capital is greater than $10,247,812, then the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by such amount. 

  

 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) _Closing Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Closing Payment in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Seller.

 7.2 _Access_. 

   

 (a) From the date hereof through the Closing, Seller shall afford to Buyer and its authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with normal operation of the business, to the properties, books, contracts, records and appropriate officers and employees of EAPC and NOARK, and shall furnish such authorized Representatives with all financial and operating data and other information concerning the affairs of the NOARK Group as Buyer and such Representatives may reasonably request, provided that Buyer and its authorized Representatives will not request information, or otherwise contact, any officer, director or employee of Seller or any member of the NOARK Group without arranging such contact with either Patricia D. Horn or Max Myers. Seller shall have the right to have a Representative present at all times during any such inspections, interviews and 

   ##### 

  

    

examinations. Additionally, Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information, including any information disclosed to Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(xi)_, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
have no right of access to, and Seller shall have no obligation to provide to
Buyer, information relating to (i) bids received from others in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or similar
transactions) and information and analyses (including financial analyses)
relating to such bids; (ii) any information the disclosure of which would
jeopardize any privilege available to EAPC, NOARK, Seller or any Seller
Affiliate relating to such information or would cause EAPC, NOARK, Seller or
any Seller Affiliate to breach a confidentiality obligation; or (iii)
any information the disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law.
To the extent reasonably practicable, Seller and Buyer shall use Reasonable
Efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restriction of the preceding sentence apply. Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate to ensure that the provision of access hereunder
to Buyer and its authorized Representatives shall comply in all respects with
the FERCs Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers set forth in 18
C.F.R. Part 358, et seq. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties and their Representatives, and save them harmless, effective as and from the date hereof, from and against any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, or expenses that they or any of them may suffer or incur, or that may be made or brought against any of them, as a result of, in respect of, or arising out of any injury to the person or property of Buyer or its Representatives as a result of, or in connection with any site visits or inspections of the assets or properties of any Seller Indemnified Party. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7.2_ SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION. 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose all information relating to any member of the NOARK Group or any of their respective businesses or assets (the " _Restricted Information_ "), and shall not directly or indirectly use such Restricted Information for any purpose, except as and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement. The obligation to keep such Restricted Information confidential shall continue indefinitely from the Closing Date and shall not apply to any information that (i) is in the public domain, (ii) is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain through no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives or (iii) becomes available to Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source that did not acquire such information (directly or indirectly) from Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives on a confidential basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may make disclosures 

   ##### 

  

    

required by Law and in connection with disputes hereunder; _provided, however_
, that Seller, to the extent practicable, shall provide Buyer with prompt
notice thereof so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 7.2(c)_. In
the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or Buyer
waives compliance with the provisions of this _Section 7.2(c)_ , Seller shall
or shall cause the Person required to disclose such Restricted Information to
furnish only that portion of the information that such Person is
legally required, and, to the extent practicable, Seller shall exercise its
Reasonable Efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
is accorded the Restricted Information so furnished. 

   

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Seller shall, in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, request from each bidder that entered into a confidentiality agreement with Seller regarding the possible acquisition by such bidder of the Shares, that such bidder return to NOARK any and all Restricted Information furnished to such bidder. 

   

 (e) All Restricted Information shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Parties understand and agree that the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer agrees to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were an original party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, any restrictions contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement relating to Buyers use or disclosure of the Restricted Information shall be null and void. 

   

 (f) Commencing promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Seller will provide representatives of Buyer during normal business hours, at no cost or expense to Seller and at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, with access to (and, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), reasonable assistance from) (i) data, including accounting and other books and records, (ii) the accountants responsible for the financial statements of the NOARK Group, and (iii) appropriate personnel of Seller and Sellers Affiliates, in each case as reasonably required by Buyer to enable Buyer to prepare with respect to EAPC and NOARK as soon as practicable (and in any event within 75 days) following the execution of this Agreement: (A) GAAP audited balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows for each of its three most recent fiscal years, and (B) any other financial statements reasonably required by Buyer. Seller agrees to authorize the access to Buyers independent auditors to the working papers associated with the financial statements of the NOARK Group. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will cause EAPC to retain Ernst and Young to prepare any such financial statements at Buyers sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 7.2(f)_ to the contrary, under no circumstances shall Seller or any of its Affiliates have any liability or responsibility for any financial statements prepared in connection with this _Section 7.2(f)_, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and after the Closing for any Losses arising out of or relating to such financial statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a limitation on the representations set forth in _Section 4.6_ or _Section 5.4_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.3 _Third Party Approvals_. Buyer and Seller shall (and shall each cause their respective Affiliates to) use Reasonable Efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 7.4 _Regulatory Filings_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to (a) make or cause to be made the filings required of such party or any of its Affiliates (and, in the case of Seller and any of its respective Affiliates) under any Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay any fees due of it in connection with such filings, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days after the date hereof, (b) cooperate with the other Party and furnish all information in such Partys possession that is necessary in connection with such other Partys filings, (c) use Reasonable Efforts to cause the expiration of the notice or waiting periods under the HSR Act and, if applicable, any other Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is reasonably practicable, (d) promptly inform the other Party of any communication from or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings, (e) consult and cooperate with the other Party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings with Governmental Authorities relating to such filings, (f) comply, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Party or any of its Affiliates under the HSR Act and any other Laws for additional information, documents or other materials, (g) use Reasonable Efforts to resolve any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (h) use Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any action or proceeding instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Law. If a Party intends to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority with respect to such filings, it shall give the other Party reasonable prior notice of such meeting. 

  

 7.5 _Employee and Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) _Schedule 7.5(a)_ sets forth a list of certain employees of Seller or its Affiliates (other than any member of the NOARK Group) who have provided services relating to NOARKs business that Seller and its Affiliates shall make available to Buyer to discuss potential employment with Buyer after the Closing (such employees being collectively the " _Eligible Employees_ "). Within 10 days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall offer employment (which shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing) to each Eligible Employee that Buyer desires to employ, and Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of the identities of the Eligible Employees to whom Buyer has made an offer. Each offer of employment to a Eligible Employee shall be consistent with the provisions of this  _Section 7.5_ and shall remain open for a period of at least seven days. On or before the date that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller as to each Eligible Employee who has accepted employment with Buyer and each Eligible Employee who has rejected an offer of such employment. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall provide Buyer with reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

access to the Eligible Employees. Seller and its Affiliates shall not take any
action to discourage any Eligible Employee from accepting an offer of
employment from Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that
Seller will provide information to Lynn Stout and Howard Henry that would
outline for such Eligible Employees what their duties and compensation would
be if they were to remain employees of Seller, and no such action shall be
deemed to violate the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence;
_provided, however,_ that if such employees remain employees of Seller, then
Seller will make such employees available to Buyer to provide services for up
to four months after the Closing Date. Seller will provide to Buyer copies of
any such information that is provided to either Lynn Stout or Howard Henry.
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to all Losses relating to or arising out of the employee
selection and employment offer process described in the preceding provisions
of this _Section 7.5(a)_ (including any claim of discrimination or other
illegality in such selection and offer process). The date of employment
commencement with Buyer (the " _Hire Date_ ") of each Eligible Employee who
accepts such employment with Buyer shall be the Closing Date;  _provided,
however_ that with respect to any Eligible Employee to whom an employment
offer was made and who does not report for work on the Closing Date because
of an illness or injury, Buyer, in its sole discretion, may delay such
Eligible Employees Hire Date to the date upon which such individual is able
to and does commence active duty with Buyer. 

   

 (b) For a period of at least one year beginning on the Closing Date and subject to the remaining paragraphs of this _Section 7.5_ and an individuals continued employment with EAPC, NOARK, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, Buyer shall cause each Eligible Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer as provided in _Section 7.5_ (a) (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") to be provided, commencing as of the date the Continuing Employee becomes an employee of Buyer or its Affiliates, with (i) base salary or base wage rate (as applicable) on a basis at least equal to 104% of the base salary or base wage rate paid to such Continuing Employee by Seller and its Affiliates to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to Closing and (ii) benefits on a basis substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee and the Continuing Employees eligible dependents (including all such Continuing Employees dependents covered immediately prior to such Continuing Employees Hire Date by a Plan that is a group health plan), to (i) be eligible for coverage under group health, prescription drug, dental and similar type welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate thereof or that provide benefits to the Continuing Employee and such eligible dependents, effective as of such Continuing Employees Hire Date and (ii) for purposes of satisfying deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or other similar limitations, credit such Continuing Employee, for the year during which such coverage under such plans begins, with any deductibles, co-insurance and co-payments already incurred during such year under Plans that provide similar benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Continuing Employee shall be responsible for providing the necessary information to Buyer based on explanation of benefit forms received by the Continuing Employee from the corresponding Plan. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) Buyer shall cause the employee benefit plans and programs maintained after the Closing by the NOARK Group, Buyer, or Affiliates of Buyer, as the case may be, to recognize each Continuing Employees years of service and level of seniority prior to such Continuing Employees Hire Date with Seller and Sellers Affiliates, as the case may be (including service and seniority with any other employer that was recognized by Seller or Sellers Affiliates, as the case may be), for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, retirement eligibility, and benefit determination under such plans and programs, including paid vacation, paid sick time, severance benefits and employer contribution rates under retirement plans (but excluding accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to his or her Hire Date to credit for such service for such purposes under any similar employee benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates. Promptly after each Continuing Employees Hire Date, Seller shall provide written notice to Buyer of such prior service credit. Buyer shall cause each employee welfare benefit plan or program sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates that a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in on or after the Closing Date to waive any preexisting condition exclusion or any proof of insurability requirement with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee or such employees dependents, but only to the extent that such exclusions or requirements were not imposed with respect to such Continuing Employee and/or such employees dependents under a corresponding plan maintained by Seller or one of its Affiliates. 

   

 (e) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, unless acting in accordance with Buyers prior written consent, for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is two years after the Closing Date, solicit, encourage or induce any Continuing Employee to become an employee of the Seller or any of its Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any general solicitations not directed at any Continuing Employee. 

   

 (f) Seller shall cause continuation coverage (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder) required to be provided under any group health plan of Seller or its Affiliates to all employees of Seller or its Affiliates (and their dependents) who are M and A qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury regulation Section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who elect such coverage, to be so provided, but only for the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such coverage. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed or interpreted as requiring Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any of their employees (including the Continuing Employees) following the Closing Date, or, except as otherwise required by this _Section 7.5_, to prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from changing the terms and conditions of employment (including compensation and benefits) of any of their employees (including the Continuing Employees) following the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (h) If the employment of any Continuing Employee terminates (for any reason other than death, disability, voluntary termination or a termination for cause) within one year of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall provide such Continuing Employee with the severance benefits described on _Schedule 7.5(h)_. Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for any such severance benefit payments and for any reasonable costs and expenses (including employment taxes imposed on the employer) incurred by Buyer in connection with providing such severance benefits. 

  

 7.6 _Seller Marks_. Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or any other right whatsoever to use the word "OGE" or "Enogex" or any trademarks containing or comprising the foregoing, or any trademark confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "). From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall (a) cause EAPC to change its name, and will cease to use the name "Enogex Arkansas Pipeline Corporation" or any other name used by EAPC or any derivative or abbreviation thereof in any manner, or any name similar to any of the foregoing names, (b) cause EAPC and NOARK to cease using the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or indirectly, except for such limited uses as cannot be promptly terminated (e.g., signage, e-mail addresses, and as a referral or pointer to the acquired website), and to cease such limited usage of the Seller Marks as promptly as possible after the Closing and in any event within 90 days following the Closing Date and (c) remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from all assets and all other materials owned, possessed or used by the NOARK Group. The Parties agree, because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to enforce this  _Section 7.6_ shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof in addition to other remedies available at law or in equity. This covenant shall survive indefinitely without limitation as to time. 

  

 7.7 _Books and Records; Access_. From and after the Closing: 

   

 (a) Seller and its respective Affiliates may retain a copy of any or all of the data room materials and other books and records relating to the business or operations of the NOARK Group on or before the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Buyer shall preserve and keep a copy of the NOARK Group Documents that are or come into Buyers possession for a period of at least seven years after the Closing Date (the " _Retention Period_ "). After the expiration of the Retention Period, before Buyer shall dispose of any NOARK Group Documents, Buyer shall give Seller at least 90 days prior notice to such effect, and Seller shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any NOARK Group Documents as Seller may select. Buyer shall provide to Seller, at no cost or expense to Seller, full access to the NOARK Group Documents as remain in Buyers possession and full access to the properties and employees of Buyer, EAPC and NOARK in connection with matters relating to the business or operations of EAPC or NOARK on or before the Closing Date and any disputes relating to this Agreement. 

  

 7.8 _Notifications and Permits; FERC Order 2004; Shared Frequencies_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall provide all notices and otherwise take all actions required to transfer or reissue any Permits, including those required under Environmental Laws, as a 

   ##### 

  

    

result of or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with Buyer to
provide information necessary to apply for such Permits. 

   

 (b) As between Buyer and Seller, from the Closing Date until Seller is no longer providing services to Buyer under the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall cause Ozark Gas Transmission, L.L.C. to comply with, and to provide all notices and otherwise take all actions required by the regulations promulgated by FERC under FERC Order No. 2004, as amended, for a Transmission Provider (as such term is defined in such order), and, with respect to each Energy Affiliate (as such term is defined in such order) of Ozark Gas Transmission, L.L.C., Buyer shall cause the Energy Affiliate to comply with such regulations, to the extent that the regulations apply to the Energy Affiliate; _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall not be responsible for any actions or other non-compliance by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any member of the NOARK Group). 

   

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will use their respective Reasonable Efforts (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) to share the Shared Frequencies. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute frequencies as soon as practicable, and upon Sellers so obtaining any such substitute frequency, Buyer will no longer be under any obligation to share the corresponding Shared Frequency with Seller (except as expressly otherwise agreed pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement in order to permit Seller to provide services under the Transition Service Agreement). 

  

 7.9 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. For a period of not less than six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Organizational Documents of EAPC and NOARK to continue to include the same provisions concerning the exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses to and holding harmless of, all past and present employees, officers, agents and directors of such entity for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing as are contained in such documents as of the date of execution of this Agreement, and Buyer shall cause EAPC and NOARK to jointly and severally honor all such provisions, including making any indemnification payments and expense advancements thereunder. If any indemnifiable claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of such claim shall continue to the extent currently permitted under the relevant entitys Organizational Documents until such claim is disposed of or all orders in connection with such claim are fully satisfied. 

  

 7.10 _Company Guaranties_. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written releases of Seller and its Affiliates (other than NOARK or any NOARK Subsidiary), as applicable, from any liability or obligation, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under any Company Guaranty in effect as of the Closing, including by providing substitute guaranties with terms that are at least as favorable to the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Guaranties and by furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow
arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds or making other
arrangements as the counterparty may reasonably request. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, any of Seller and its Affiliates may, in its sole discretion, take any action to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit its liability under any and all outstanding Company Guaranties. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and after the Closing for any Losses arising out of or relating to any Company Guaranties, whether or not such guaranties have been released. 

  

 7.11 _Conversion into Single-Member Limited Liability Company_. Prior to the Closing, EAPC shall be converted into an Oklahoma single-member limited liability company by state law conversion with all related documents and instruments to be in form and substance mutually satisfactory to Seller and Buyer in their respective reasonable judgments; _provided, however,_ that such conversion documents shall provide that EAPCs name shall be changed to a name designated by Buyer at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date that is consistent with the provisions of _Section 7.6_; _provided further_ that if Buyer fails to timely designate the new name for EAPC, then Seller may choose a new name that complies with the provisions of _Section 7.6_ and change EAPCs name to that new name. Upon the conversion of EAPC into a single-member limited liability company and thereafter, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will make an election or take any action resulting in EAPC being treated as anything other than an entity disregarded from its owner for federal income tax purposes, and Seller and its Affiliates will file all federal income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such disregarded entity status. All references in this Agreement to EAPC and the Shares shall thereafter refer to EAPC as a single-member limited liability company and to 100% of the membership interests in EAPC, respectively. 

  

 7.12 _Redemption of NOARK Notes_. At the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver such notices and documents as shall be necessary to cause the Trustee to give all redemption notices that are required to redeem the Seller Portion of the NOARK Notes on the earliest date practicable after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the NOARK Indenture (such date to be referred to herein as the " _Designated Redemption Date_ "). Seller agrees to deposit with the Trustee at the Closing funds in an amount equal to the Aggregate Redemption Funding Amount (calculated as if the Designated Redemption Date were to occur on the Closing Date, except that the accrued interest portion of the Aggregate Redemption Funding Amount shall be calculated through the Designated Redemption Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall remain liable under the Seller Guaranty until the Seller Portion of the NOARK Notes has been redeemed in full in accordance with the NOARK Indenture. If the actual Aggregate Redemption Funding Amount is less than the amount deposited pursuant to this _Section 7.12_, then Seller will promptly be repaid any excess funds that were deposited at Closing. If the actual Aggregate Redemption Funding Amount is greater than the amount deposited pursuant to this _Section 7.12_ , then Seller will deposit the difference with the Trustee within one Business Day after receiving notice of the determination of the actual Redemption Price (but in no event later than the Designated Redemption Date). If any sinking 

   ##### 

  

    

fund or other payments on the NOARK Notes are scheduled between the Closing
Date and the Designated Redemption Date, then (i) if NOARK makes such a
payment, then the Trustee will pay to Buyer an amount from such deposited
funds equal to the Seller Portion of such payment made by NOARK and (ii) if
NOARK fails to make any such payment and the Seller Guaranty is called upon,
then the Trustee will use the deposited funds to make the required payment on
behalf of Seller and such payment will be deemed to be in satisfaction of
Sellers obligations with respect to such required payment under the Seller
Guaranty. The calculation of the Aggregate Redemption Funding Amount that is
made as of the Closing Date shall take into account that all required sinking
fund or other payments will be made in a timely manner between the Closing
Date and the Designated Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.12_, Seller may (at its election), instead of
depositing the funds directly with the Trustee, deposit them into escrow
with the financial institution that is acting as the Trustee (or if such
financial institution is unwilling or unable to act as escrow agent, such
other financial institution as shall be mutually agreeable to Buyer and
Seller). If Seller elects to deposit such funds into escrow, then
Buyer, Seller and such escrow agent shall enter into an escrow agreement at
Closing that is mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller and that provides for
the release of funds to the Trustee (and, if applicable, to Seller or NOARK)
in a manner consistent with the foregoing provisions of this  _Section
7.12_. 

  

 7.13 _Seller Interconnection Points_. From and after the Closing Date, Seller will not take any action to close any Existing Interconnect and will not take any action to prevent any customer on a Seller System from being able to access an Existing Interconnect. Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 7.13_ to the contrary, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide access to any customer on a Seller System or to give any such customer preferential treatment. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 

   

TAX MATTERS 

   

 8.1 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes._ Seller shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to EAPC for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall pay all Taxes owed with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Taxes are not taken into account in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital. Buyer shall file all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to EAPC and shall pay all other Taxes owed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall cause EAPCs federal taxable income for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods to be included on the consolidated federal income Tax Returns that include Seller and EAPC and Seller shall pay all Taxes attributable to such income. Liability for Taxes for any Tax period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be apportioned as follows: Property and similar ad valorem Taxes shall be apportioned on a ratable daily basis. All other Taxes, including income Taxes, shall be apportioned based on an interim closing of the books of each member of the NOARK Group as of the end of the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall each provide the other with all information reasonably necessary to prepare a Tax Return.

 10.3 _Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

   

 (a) If any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 10.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim asserted against an Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under _Section 10.2_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnified Party to dispute whether such claim is an identifiable Loss under this _Article X_), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 10.3(b)_. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;  _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any 

   ##### 

  

    

sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest,
including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting
the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The

pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_, and the Indemnified Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_ , then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of five Business Days within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such five Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, and the amount of any Loss shall take into account any net Tax benefits attributable to the circumstance or event giving rise to such Loss.
