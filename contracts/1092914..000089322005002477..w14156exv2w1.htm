to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by
the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the

Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying

reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30&nbsp;days after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all available
material written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of Damages that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of five Business Days within which to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
five Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim,
in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

insurance proceeds realized by and paid to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim,
and the amount of any Loss shall take into account any net Tax benefits attributable to the
circumstance or event giving rise to such Loss.
