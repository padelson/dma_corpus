     Section 2.6. Regulatory Documents.

     (a) Since January 1, 1999, the Company and PBF have timely filed all forms,
reports, registration statements, schedules and other documents, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were required to
be filed with any Governmental Authority, including the SEC and the NASD, and
have timely paid in full all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith other than such failures to timely file or pay that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on PBF. Since January 1,
1996, the Company has been (i) duly registered as an investment adviser under
the Advisers Act and under all applicable state statutes (if required to be so
registered under Applicable Law) and (ii) duly registered and licensed under all
other Applicable Laws or exempt therefrom, except, in the case of clause (ii),
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 2.6(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists the jurisdictions in which the Company is registered as an
investment adviser or is required to give notice that it is acting as an
investment adviser and in which it is required to be registered or licensed in
any other capacity pursuant to any of the Securities Laws. Each such
registration or license is, and when required by Applicable Law has been, in
full force and effect.

     (b) As of their respective dates, the Regulatory Documents of each of the
Company and PBF complied in all material respects with Applicable Laws as in
effect at the time the Regulatory Documents were filed, and none of such
Regulatory Documents of the Company or PBF, as of their respective dates or as
of such other dates as so required under Applicable Law, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has
previously delivered to Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of each such
Regulatory Document filed with the SEC by the Company after January 1, 1999 and
prior to the date hereof, and will deliver or make available to Buyer promptly
after the filing thereof a true, correct and complete copy of


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

each Regulatory Document filed with the SEC by the Company after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 2.7. Financial Statements; Absence of Liabilities. Attached as
Exhibit 2.7 hereto are true and correct copies of (i) the audited balance sheets
of the Company as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related audited
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, in each case accompanied by the
audit report of the Company's Accountant, with respect to the Company and (ii)
the unaudited balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2001 and 2002, and
the related statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows
for the three month periods ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, with respect to the
Company (the financial statements referred to above being referred to as the
"Company Financial Statements" and the balance sheet as of December 31, 2001
being referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet"). The balance sheets referred
to in the previous sentence (including the related notes, where applicable)
present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company as
of the dates thereof, and the other financial statements referred to in this
Section 2.7 (including the related notes thereto, where applicable) present
fairly in all material respects the results of the Company's operations and cash
flows for the respective fiscal periods therein set forth (subject to normal
year-end audit adjustments in amounts consistent with the prior year in the case
of unaudited statements), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied (except as indicated in the related notes thereto); each of the
financial statements referred to in this Section 2.7 (including the related
notes, where applicable) complies in all material respects with GAAP; and each
of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has
been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved and consistent with the books and records of
the Company. Except for (i) those liabilities that are fully reflected or
reserved against on the Company Balance Sheet or fully disclosed in the related
notes thereto and (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the date of the Company Balance Sheet and
which are not material, individually or in the aggregate, the Company does not
have any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or other and whether due or to become due, which would be required to
be shown or reserved against on a balance sheet (or described in the notes
thereto) prepared in accordance with GAAP. The books and records of the Company
have been maintained in accordance with good business practices and all
Applicable Laws and reflect only actual transactions.

Company Act) to a registered investment company nor is there any action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the Old Mutual
Parties, threatened by any Governmental Authority, which would result in the

listed on Exhibit 5.17(a) to serve in any such capacities. Neither the Company
nor any of its officers, directors or the employees listed on Exhibit 5.17(a) is

reasonably be expected to result in the



                                      -20-
<PAGE>

ineligibility of the Company or any of such persons or, to the Knowledge of the
Old Mutual Parties, that would provide a basis for such ineligibility.

collectively as the "Contracts"). As of the date hereof, each of the Contracts
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and, to the Knowledge of
the Old Mutual Parties, of each other party thereto and is in full force and
effect and enforceable against the Company (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) and, to the Knowledge of
the Old Mutual Parties, each other party thereto, in each case in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors generally and by the availability of equitable remedies (whether in
proceedings at law or in equity). As of the date hereof, the Company has not
received written or, to the Knowledge of the Old Mutual Parties, oral notice of
cancellation of or material default or breach under or intent to cancel or call
a default under any of the Contracts specified in clauses (i) to (vi) above. The

date under the Contracts, and, assuming receipt of the consents and approvals
set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 2.4, there exists no event or
condition which with or without notice or lapse of time or both would be a
default or breach on the part of the Company or on the part of the other party
to such Contracts other than any such defaults and breaches as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent, Holdings or OMAM has entered into any
confidentiality agreement that remains in effect with any Person (other than
Buyer) in connection with the proposed sale of the Company or any portion of the
Company's business.

intent to cancel any such insurance policy or bond, and no such insurance policy
is occurrence-based. A complete and accurate list of each such policy and bond
is set forth in Section 2.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     Section 2.16. Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

     (a) Section 2.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes a list of
all employee benefit, compensation, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
capital appreciation, pension, profit sharing, retirement, option, equity or
equity-based, employment, change of control, severance, reduction-in-force,
termination pay or similar plans, programs, policies, practices, arrangements or
agreements, and all life, hospitalization, medical or other welfare or employee
benefit insurance or fringe benefit plans, programs, policies, practices,
arrangements or agreements in effect as of the date hereof that are sponsored or
maintained by the Company, Parent, Holdings or OMAM or to which the Company,
Parent, Holdings or OMAM contributes or is obligated to contribute, pay premiums
or make other payments, whether actual or contingent, with respect to or on
behalf of current or former employees of the Company (the "Plans"). Section
2.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Plan as either (i) a
Plan maintained by the Company solely for the benefit of current or former
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries ("Company Plan") or (ii) a Plan
maintained by Parent, Holdings, OMAM or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(other than the Company), but under which the Company is a participating
employer. None of the Plans is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside
of the United States.

     (b) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered to Buyer a true,
correct and complete copy of each writing constituting a part of such Plan,
including without limitation all plan documents and amendments thereto, benefit
schedules, trust agreements, insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, the
most recent Form 5500 and accompanying schedules, if any, the current summary
plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any, the most recent
financial reports, if any, and the most recent determination letter from the
IRS. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered to
Buyer, there are no amendments to any Plan that have been adopted or approved
nor has Parent, Holdings, OMAM, the Company undertaken to make any such
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Plan.

     (c) The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to
each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code ("Qualified Plans") that has not been revoked. Each
trust created under any Qualified Plan is exempt under Section 501(a) of the
Code. There are no existing circumstances nor any events that have occurred nor
any amendments to a Qualified Plan that have been adopted that are reasonably
likely to affect adversely the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the
related trust. No Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan, as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code.

     (d) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and each Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws. To the
Knowledge of the Old Mutual Parties there is not now, nor do any circumstances
exist that could give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to a Plan or the imposition of any lien on the


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

assets of the Company under ERISA or the Code. No Plan is, or during the six
years prior to the date hereof has been, a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA. Each Plan that is a "group
health plan" (as defined in Section 607(l) of ERISA and Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code) has complied in all material respects with the requirements of Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and of Section 4980B of the Code. No Plan
provides post-termination welfare benefits other than as required by law.

     (e) All contributions required to be made to any Plan by Applicable Law or
regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all
premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Plan, for
any period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to
the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the Company Financial Statements.

     (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of (including the
forgiveness of indebtedness), any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or
director of the Company, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company
to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid
or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by Parent,
Holdings, OMAM or the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

     (g) There are no pending claims (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course), lawsuits, investigations by any Governmental Authority with
respect to which notice has been given to any of the Old Mutual Parties,
termination proceedings or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted,
or to the Knowledge of the Old Mutual Parties threatened or anticipated, against
the Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of the Company to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of
Treasury, the Department of Labor or any Plan participant or beneficiary.

     (h) Since January 1, 2001, the Company has not increased the compensation
or benefits (other than (i) regularly scheduled increases of welfare benefits
(ii) changes in individual bonus amounts and (iii) regular annual merit-based
increases in base salary, in each case in the ordinary course of business)
provided pursuant to a Plan in any material respect.

Property that is registered with any Governmental Authority by the Company, or
subject to an application for registration with any Governmental Authority
submitted by or on behalf of the Company, is listed in Section 2.17 of the

of all jurisdictions in which such Registered IP is registered or registrations
have been applied for and all registration and application numbers. All
Registered IP owned by the Company has been duly registered in, filed in or
issued by the appropriate Governmental Authority where such registration, filing
or issuance is necessary for the conduct of the business

     Section 5.2. Section 15 of the Investment Company Act: Company Covenants.

     (a) Each of the Old Mutual Parties will, and Holdings will cause OMAM to,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cause the Funds to
obtain, as promptly as practicable, the approval of the Fund Boards and the
shareholders of each Fund, if and to the extent such approval is required

applicable thereto, of a new Investment Company Advisory Agreement for such Fund
with the Company serving as adviser or subadviser, such agreement having the
same advisory fees in effect as of the date hereof and becoming effective upon
the Closing, and which agreement will otherwise be substantially on the same
terms as currently in effect.

     (b) Buyer shall cooperate with the Old Mutual Parties, including without
limitation making management representatives available, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Old Mutual Parties, in connection with obtaining the consents
and approvals described in this Section 5.2.

     Section 5.3. Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreement Consents. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall send notices
complying with Applicable Law (each a "Notice"), informing its Clients of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and requesting the written consent
or approval of the assignment or deemed assignment if Client consent to such
assignment or deemed assignment is required by Applicable Law or is required
under the respective Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreement for such
assignment or deemed assignment resulting from the Transaction. Buyer agrees
that consent for any Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreement to the assignment
or deemed assignment resulting from the Transaction shall be deemed given for
all purposes hereunder (i) if no consent is required under Applicable Law or the
respective Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreements, (ii) upon receipt of the
written consent requested in the Notice or (iii) to the extent permissible under
Applicable Law and if no consent is required under the applicable Non-Investment
Company Advisory Agreement, if forty-five (45) days shall have passed since the
sending of written notice ("Negative Consent Notice") to a Client (which
Negative Consent Notice may be included in the Notice) requesting written
consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (a) of the intention to complete
the Transaction, which will result in a deemed assignment of such Non-Investment
Company Advisory Agreement; (b) of the Company's intention to continue to
provide the advisory services pursuant to the existing Non-Investment Company
Advisory Agreement with such Client after the Closing if such Client does not
terminate such agreement prior to the Closing; and (c) that the consent of such
Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client continues to accept
such advisory services for a period of at least forty-five (45) days after the
sending of the Negative Consent Notice without termination (provided, that such
Client shall not have affirmatively stated to any Old Mutual Party or OMAM that
it does not so consent or terminated its respective Non-Investment Company
Advisory Agreement prior to the Closing). Buyer shall be provided a reasonable
opportunity to review all such consent materials to be used by the Company prior
to distribution, and such materials shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Holdings. The Old Mutual Parties shall provide to
Buyer copies of any and all substantive correspondence between any of them or
OMAM and Clients or representatives or counsel of such Clients relating to any
consent solicitation.

     Section 5.4. Insurance. The Old Mutual Parties will, and Holdings will
cause OMAM to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect

until the Closing Date with respect to insurance policies and fidelity bonds
covering the Company (including insurance policies and fidelity bonds relating
to the Company, its assets and employees) on the date hereof or to procure
comparable replacement policies and bonds (or such replacement coverage as is
obtainable on a commercially reasonable basis) and maintain such policies and
bonds in effect until the Closing.

     Section 5.5. Section 15 of the Investment Company Act: Buyer's Covenants.
Buyer shall use its best efforts to assure compliance with the conditions of
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act with respect to PBF. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees that: (i) for a period of not less than
three years after the date of consummation of the PBF Reorganization, Buyer
shall use its best efforts to assure that no more than 25% of the members of the
Fund Board of the Reorganized Fund shall be "interested persons" (as defined for
purposes of Section 15(f)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) of Buyer (or such
other entity


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

that is an Affiliate of Buyer that acts as adviser or subadviser to the
Reorganized Fund); and (ii) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, for a
period of at least two years after the date of the consummation of the PBF
Reorganization, shall have any express or implied understanding, arrangement or
intention to impose an "unfair burden" (as such term is used in Section 15(f) of
the Investment Company Act) on PBF as a result of the transactions contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the covenants
of Buyer contained in this Section 5.5 are intended only for the benefit of the
parties hereto. Buyer shall notify and discuss with the board of trustees of the
Reorganized Fund the requirements of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
as they apply to the Reorganized Fund.

     Section 5.6. Employees, Employee Benefits.

     (a) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide
insurance coverage under welfare benefit plans to the employees of the Company
as of the Closing (the "Company Employees") that is substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the insurance coverage currently provided to such employees
under the welfare benefit plans of the Company. Following the Closing Date, the
Company Employees shall be eligible to become participants in the Buyer 401(k)
and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Buyer Qualified Plan") and the Buyer Scholarship
Plan, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect from time to
time. Except as expressly provided in the prior sentence or as otherwise agreed
upon by the Company and the Buyer, the Company Employees shall not be eligible
to participate in the employee benefit or compensation plans, programs or
arrangements of Buyer.

     (b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to any group health plans
under which the Company Employees are eligible to receive benefits, Buyer will,
or will cause the Company to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent such limitations or
waiting periods did not apply to a Company Employee under the comparable plans
of the Company) to be waived with respect to a the Company Employee and their
eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee credit, for the plan
year in which the Company Employee becomes eligible to receive benefits under
such plans, towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the time of such eligibility. Solely for purposes of
the vesting of benefits under the Buyer Qualified Plan, each Company Employee
shall receive service credit for employment with the Company (or its
predecessor), to the same extent such service was recognized by the OMAM for
such purpose under the tax-qualified defined contribution plan in which the
Company Employees were eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing.
For purposes of eligibility to participate in the Buyer Scholarship Plan, each
Company Employee shall receive service credit for employment with the Company
(or its predecessor).

     (c) Buyer shall permit each Company Employee who is a participant in the
United Asset Management Corporation Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan (the
"Holdings Plan"), and who elects to transfer his or her account balance under
the Holdings Plan, to roll over his or her account balance (including any
outstanding loans thereunder) to the Buyer Qualified Plan, as soon as
practicable following the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Buyer
Qualified Plan. Holdings agrees to use and to cause OMAM to use its best efforts
to cooperate with Buyer, its agents and designees to ensure a smooth transfer of
accounts, records and recordkeeping to effect the transfers described in the
previous sentence. Holdings further agrees to take and to


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

cause OMAM to take such actions as are necessary, including securing the
cooperation of the recordkeeper, trustee and other service providers of Holdings
Plan, to effect such transfers.

     (d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to
prevent Buyer from terminating, amending or modifying to any extent or in any
respect at any time or from time to time (i) Buyer's employment relationship
with any employee, including any Company Employee, (ii) the terms and conditions
of the employment of any employee, including the Company Employees, (iii) any of
the Company Plans or (iv) any of the Buyer's employee benefit plans, including
the Buyer Qualified Plan and the Buyer Scholarship Plan. Nothing in this Section
5.6 shall be construed to provide a contract of employment, or to provide any
other promise of future employment or benefits, to the Company Employees.

     Section 5.7. Further Assurances. Each party to this Agreement shall execute
such documents and other papers and perform such further acts as may be
reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Upon the request of Buyer, the Old Mutual Parties shall,
Holdings shall cause OMAM to, and Holdings shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the other Holdings Controlled Affiliates to, promptly execute and
deliver such further instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or authorization and other documents as Buyer may
reasonably request to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that any such instruments and other documents shall not
provide for any representations or warranties or covenants that are not
expressly contemplated by or expressly provided for in this Agreement). This
Section 5.7 shall not apply to PBF, which is subject to the provisions of
Section 5.19.

     Section 5.8. Efforts of Parties to Close. Subject to Section 5.11, during
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, each party
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the execution and delivery of any documents,
certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. During the period from the
date of this Agreement and continuing through the Closing, except as required by
Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of Buyer, in the case of any of
the Old Mutual Parties, or Holdings, in the case of Buyer, no party to this
Agreement shall knowingly take any action which, or knowingly fail to take any
action the failure of which to be taken, would, or could reasonably be expected
to: (i) result in any of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the party taking or failing to take such action being
or becoming untrue in any material respect; (ii) result in any conditions to the
Closing set forth in Article VI not being satisfied; or (iii) result in any
material violation of one or more provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 5.9. Confidentiality and Announcements.

     (a) The parties agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that effective upon the
Closing, Buyer's obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
with respect to information to the extent relating to the Company or its
business or operations and with respect to disclosure relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.



                                      -38-
<PAGE>

     (b) For a period of four years from and after the Closing, Holdings shall,
and shall cause OMAM and the Centralized Entities and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and advisors (other than any directors of OMAM or
Holdings who are not officers or employees of Holdings, OMAM or any Centralized
Entity) (each a "Restricted Person") to, keep confidential and not use for its
benefit or for the benefit of any other Person, and will not disclose to any
other Person, any and all Restricted Information. For the avoidance of doubt,
there shall be no restriction on the use or disclosure by Holdings, OMAM and the
Centralized Entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and
advisors of information described in clause (iii) of the second sentence of the
definition of Restricted Information. Holdings shall be liable hereunder for any
failure by any Restricted Person to comply with this Section 5.9(b); provided,
however, that Holdings shall not be liable under this Section 5.9(b) with
respect to any disclosure of Restricted Information to the extent such
disclosure is (i) compelled by legal process (by interrogatories, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) so long as the last sentence of
this Section 5.9(b) has been complied with or (ii) in the opinion of its
counsel, required by Applicable Law (including without limitation the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or any U.S. national or foreign stock exchange). Prior to
making any disclosure of Restricted Information otherwise permitted pursuant to
clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 5.9(b), the
Restricted Person proposing to make such disclosure shall provide the Company
with prompt written notice of the legal process requiring such disclosure so
that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9(b). If, in the absence
of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver made by the
Company, the Restricted Person is nonetheless, in the opinion of its counsel,
legally compelled to disclose Restricted Information to any tribunal or else
stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Restricted
Person may, without liability on the part of Holdings hereunder, disclose to
such tribunal only that portion of such information which such counsel advises
the Restricted Person is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the
Restricted Person exercises its reasonable best efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of such information, including by cooperating with the Company
to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information by such tribunal. The
parties acknowledge that the Company and Buyer, on the one hand, and Holdings
and its Affiliates (within the meaning of the first sentence only of the
definition of "Affiliate"), on the other hand, will compete following the
Closing.

     (c) Subject to Sections 5.11(a) and (b), prior to the Closing the parties
to this Agreement shall consult with each other as to the form, substance and
timing of any press release or other public disclosure related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and no such press release or other
public disclosure shall be made without the consent of the other parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that
the parties may make such disclosure to the extent required by Applicable Law or
the applicable rules of the African Exchanges, based on advice of counsel, after
making all reasonable best efforts under the circumstances to consult with each
other prior to such disclosure.

     Section 5.10. Access; Certain Communications. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the Old Mutual Parties shall,
and Holdings shall cause OMAM to, afford to Buyer and its authorized agents and
representatives access, upon reasonable notice


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

and during normal business hours, to all properties of, and all contracts,
documents and information of or relating to the assets, liabilities, business,
customers, Funds, Clients, employees, operations, personnel and other aspects of
the business of, and all personnel of, the Company; provided, however, that such
access shall be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
the Old Mutual Parties' normal operations, customers, and employee relations;
and provided further, that Holdings and OMAM shall be required to provide access
to information regarding Funds, Clients and customers of the Company only to the
extent such information relates to the Company or the Company's business or, in
the case of PBF, the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 5.11. Regulatory Matters; Third Party Consents.

     (a) The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate with each other and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file (on a
confidential basis if reasonably requested by the other parties) all necessary
documentation, to effect (on a confidential basis if reasonably requested by the
other parties) all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
necessary or advisable to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any filing to be made under the HSR Act, which filings
shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than
30 days of the date of this Agreement), and requests for required consents under
the Contracts (provided that efforts to obtain Client and Fund consents are
covered in Sections 5.2 and 5.3). Buyer and the Company agree to take all
reasonable steps necessary to satisfy any conditions or requirements imposed by
any Governmental Authority in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than those conditions or
requirements, in the aggregate, the satisfaction of which are reasonably likely
to result in either a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the Transaction pursuant to
the terms hereof or a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The parties to this Agreement will have the
right to review in advance, and will consult with the other parties on, all the
information relating to Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that
each party will keep the other parties apprised in a timely manner of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that none of the information regarding it or any of
its Affiliates (within the meaning of the first sentence only of the definition
of "Affiliate") supplied or to be supplied by it or to be supplied on its behalf
specifically for inclusion in any documents to be filed with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will, at the
respective times such documents are filed with any Governmental Authority,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.



                                      -40-
<PAGE>

     (b) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall promptly advise each other
upon receiving any communication relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise materially affecting its ability to timely
consummate the Transaction pursuant to the terms hereof from any Governmental
Authority whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 5.12. Notification of Certain Matters. Each party to this Agreement
shall give prompt notice to the other parties, to the extent Known by such
party, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event or existence of
any condition that has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any of
its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement,
up to and including the Closing Date, (ii) the occurrence of any matter or event
that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(iii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy, in any material
respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, (iv) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the consummation of the Transaction, and (v) any lawsuit, action
or proceeding pending or, to the applicable party's Knowledge, threatened
against the party or the parties relating to the Transaction; provided, however,
that no party shall have any liability for breach of this Section 5.12 except to
the extent that another party has been actually prejudiced by such breach.

     Section 5.13. Expenses. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement (including without limitation Sections 1.4, 5.19 and 8.10), the
parties shall each bear their respective direct and indirect expenses incurred
in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that any amounts
relating to any financial advisor, legal, accounting or other transaction fees
incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (other than amounts relating
to counsel to the members of management of the Company in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of the Employment Agreements, the LLC Agreement or
other employment agreements between the applicable employee of the Company, on
the one hand, and Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Company and its successor), on the other hand, in connection with
the Transaction) shall be paid prior to the Closing or shall be fully accrued on
the Adjustment Amount Documents. Each of Buyer and Holdings shall share equally
all the costs and expenses of preparing, printing and mailing the proxy
statements and related solicitation documents and other expenses relating to
obtaining the approvals contemplated by Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

     Section 5.14. Third Party Proposals. None of the Old Mutual Parties shall,
nor shall they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors,
employees, representatives or agents, including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant engaged by any of them, to, directly or indirectly solicit,
encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals, or enter into any agreement,
with respect to, or initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions
with any Person concerning, any acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial
portion of the assets of, or of any equity interest or capital stock in, the
Company, or any merger or business combination with the Company, or except as
may otherwise be permitted by Section 5.2, 5.3 or 5.19, any voluntary assignment
of any investment advisory, subadvisory,

administrative or distribution agreements of the Company, in each case other
than in respect of the Transaction (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"; provided,
however, that an Acquisition Proposal shall not include any changes in the
arrangements with the Funds other than PBF), or furnish any information to any
Person contacting them or making an inquiry with respect to a potential
Acquisition Proposal; it being understood and agreed that the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include any acquisition or purchase of any of the assets of,
or equity interests in, Holdings or OMAM (other than assets of, or equity
interests in, the Company), or any merger or business combination between
Holdings or OMAM and any third party. The Old Mutual Parties shall notify Buyer
within 48 hours (but not less than one Business Day), if any Acquisition
Proposal (including the terms thereof) is received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be
initiated with, any of the Old Mutual Parties, any of their respective
Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents,
including any investment banker, attorney or accountant engaged by any of them.
It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.14 by any executive officer of any of the Old Mutual Parties or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Old Mutual
Parties, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.14 by the Old Mutual
Parties. The Old Mutual Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, representatives and advisors to,
immediately cease or cause to be terminated any existing activities, including
discussions or negotiations with any parties, conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall seek to have all materials

of their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
representatives or advisors returned to the Company promptly or destroyed. None
of the Old Mutual Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, employees, representatives or agents, including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant engaged by any of them, shall amend, modify,
waive or terminate, or otherwise release any Person from, any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreement or arrangement currently in effect in
relation to an Acquisition Proposal. The Old Mutual Parties shall cause their
respective officers, directors, agents, advisors and Subsidiaries to comply with
the provisions of this Section 5.14.

     Section 5.15. Employee Payments.

     (a) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay to certain of
its employees an aggregate amount (the "Accrued Bonus Pool Amount") equal to (i)
the Company's 30% profit sharing bonus pool for the period from January 1, 2002
through the month-end prior to the Closing Date, plus (ii) the Stub-Period
Amount (as defined below), such Accrued Bonus Pool Amount to be calculated in
accordance with Exhibit 5.15(a), with the allocation of such Accrued Bonus Pool
Amount to be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company with the

through the month-end prior to the Closing, and (2) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days that have elapsed after the month-end prior to the

     Section 5.17. Non-Solicitation.

     (a) Holdings understands that Buyer shall be entitled to protect and
preserve the going concern value of the business of the Company to the extent
provided herein and that Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement absent
the provisions of this Section 5.17 and, therefore, agrees that until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) Holdings shall not, and shall cause OMAM
and the Centralized Entities and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (A)
solicit, encourage or

successor thereto) or (B) hire any of such persons listed on Exhibit 5.17(b);
provided that it shall not be a violation of clauses (i)(A) or (ii)(A) above to

advertisements, that are not directed specifically at employees of the Company;
provided further that the provisions of clause (i) hereof shall not apply to any
Person who is both (x) a director, officer or employee of OMAM or a Centralized
Entity on the one hand, and (y) any other Holdings Controlled Affiliate on the
other hand acting in his or her capacity as such with such other Holdings
Controlled Affiliate.

     (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood
and agreed that remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of
the covenants contained in this Section 5.17, and Buyer shall be entitled to
equitable relief in respect thereof, including the remedy of specific
performance, with respect to any breach of such covenants, without the need to
show any proof of damages.

     Section 5.18. Use of NWQ Name. Holdings agrees that from and after the
Closing, except as set forth in Section 5.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall have no rights to the use of the "NWQ" name

necessary to terminate as of the Closing the use of the "NWQ" name or mark or
any formatives thereof by Holdings, OMAM or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.19.     Pilgrim Baxter Fund.

     (a) Holdings will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and will cause
Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
as promptly as practicable, the approvals of the board of trustees of PBHG Funds
and (as necessary) the shareholders of PBF, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 15 of the Investment Company Act applicable thereto and in the manner
required by the declaration of trust and the other organizational documents of
PBF, as applicable, of (i) a sub-advisory agreement (the "Interim Sub-Advisory
Agreement") between Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. and the Company (or its
successor) to cover the interim period following the Closing (and the resultant
change of control of the Company), which agreement will satisfy the conditions
of Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act, (ii) a sub-advisory agreement
(the "Permanent Sub-Advisory Agreement") between Pilgrim Baxter & Associates,
Ltd. and the Company (or its successor) to take effect upon PBF shareholder
approval of the Permanent Sub-Advisory Agreement, and (iii) a reorganization
(the "PBF Reorganization") of PBF into a newly-formed series of Nuveen
Investment Trust II, a Massachusetts business trust, or other appropriate entity
identified by Buyer, as contemplated below (the "Reorganized Fund").

     (b) The new Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement and Permanent Sub-Advisory
Agreement will be identical in all material respects to the sub-advisory
agreement currently in effect between Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. and the
Company (the "Current Sub-Advisory


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

Agreement"). Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. shall terminate and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the board of trustees of PBHG Funds to
terminate the Permanent Sub-Advisory Agreement if shareholders of PBF approve
the PBF Reorganization. In connection with the PBF Reorganization, a new
sub-advisory agreement will be entered into between the Company and Nuveen
Institutional Advisory Corp., a Delaware corporation and SEC-registered
investment adviser, or other appropriate entity identified by Buyer ("NIAC")
("New Sub-Advisory Agreement") and a new investment advisory agreement will be
entered into between the Reorganized Fund and NIAC ("New Advisory Agreement").
The New Sub-Advisory Agreement and New Advisory Agreement will be identical in
all material respects to the Current Sub-Advisory Agreement and the advisory
agreement currently in effect between Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. and PBF
("Current Advisory Agreement"), respectively, except that (i) the investment
adviser shall be NIAC, (ii) each agreement shall be effective upon the
consummation of the PBF Reorganization and shall have an initial term of not
more than two years, and (iii) the fees paid to the Company pursuant to the New
Sub-Advisory Agreement may be higher or lower than those currently paid pursuant
to the Current Sub-Advisory Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the gross
advisory fees paid to NIAC pursuant to the New Advisory Agreement (including
fees paid by NIAC to the Company pursuant to the New Sub-Advisory Agreement)
shall not be greater than those paid pursuant to the Current Advisory Agreement.

     (c) The Old Mutual Parties and Buyer will each use their reasonable best
efforts to cause an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to be entered into
between PBHG Funds and Nuveen Investment Trust II, and/or another appropriate
entity, providing for the reorganization of PBF from a separate series of PBHG
Funds into a separate series of Nuveen Investment Trust II (or such other
entity), upon terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth in
the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization made as of October 22, 2001 by and
between UAM Funds, Inc. and PBHG Funds; provided that the occurrence of the
Closing shall be a condition to the parties' respective obligations to
consummate such reorganization under such agreement; and provided, further, that
Holdings shall bear all out-of-pocket expenses relating to the PBF
Reorganization.|

     (d) (i) Provided that the Closing shall have theretofore occurred, Holdings
will pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to $1.5 million (the "PBF Refund")
plus interest thereon calculated at the Treasury Rate for the period from the
Closing Date up to but not including the date of payment, by Wire Transfer as
set forth in written instructions from Buyer, on the earlier to occur, if any,
of (a) the second Business Day following the date on which the board of trustees
of PBHG Funds or the shareholders of PBF shall have voted upon, and shall not
have approved, the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Permanent Sub-Advisory
Agreement or the Reorganization in accordance herewith or (b) November 7, 2002
(or such later date prior to the expiration of the Interim Sub-Advisory
Agreement as Buyer may determine in its sole discretion), in the event that the
Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Permanent Sub-Advisory Agreement or the PBF
Reorganization shall not have been approved on or before the date seven days
prior to such date and the PBF Reorganization shall not have been completed on
or before such date, provided that the failure of such reorganization to have
been completed on or before such date shall not have been caused by a material
breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Section 5.19 or its covenants
under the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization contemplated by paragraph (c) of
this Section 5.19. In the event that the PBF Refund is paid hereunder, Holdings
shall have no further obligation under this Section 5.19 to cause the PBF
Reorganization. In the


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

event that the PBF Reorganization is effected after the PBF Refund has been
paid, (i) Buyer shall refund to Holdings the PBF Refund plus interest thereon
calculated at the Treasury Rate for the period from the payment date up to but
not including the date of payment and (ii) Holdings shall pay Buyer an amount
equal to the advisory fees that PBF paid Pilgrim Baxter & Associates Ltd. for
the period from November 7, 2002 through the date of the PBF Reorganization plus
interest thereon calculated at the Treasury Rate for the relevant period up to
but not including the date of payment. Both such payments shall be made by Wire
Transfer as set forth in written instructions from the respective recipient on
the second Business Day following the date of the PBF Reorganization.

     (ii) In the event that, prior to the Closing, the board of trustees of PBHG
Funds or the shareholders of PBF shall have voted upon, and shall not have
approved, the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Permanent Sub-Advisory
Agreement or the PBF Reorganization in accordance herewith, the Initial Purchase
Consideration and the Purchase Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal
to $1.5 million (the "PBF Adjustment") and Holdings shall have no further
obligation to effect the PBF Reorganization under this Section 5.19.

     Section 5.20. Delivery of Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule. The Old Mutual
Parties will deliver to Buyer not later than the third Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, a true, complete and correct schedule setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation of the Closing Wrap Account Revenue Run-Rate and the
Closing Other Account Revenue Run-Rate. The Old Mutual Parties and Buyer shall
consult and cooperate with respect to the preparation of such schedule. Buyer
shall have an opportunity to review the schedule setting forth the calculation
of the Closing Wrap Account Revenue Run-Rate and the Closing Other Account
Revenue Run-Rate and, if the Closing occurs, unless Buyer shall have raised an
objection within 14 days after the Closing Date, Buyer and Holdings shall be
deemed to have irrevocably accepted such schedule.

     Section 5.21. Permitted Distributions; Payment of Intercompany Balances.
Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the Company may declare
and make any cash distributions; provided that such distributions will not
result in the Working Capital Amount being less than $2.4 million less the
aggregate amount payable by the Company pursuant to Section 5.15(b). Immediately
prior to the Closing, the Old Mutual Parties will take all action necessary such
that all intercompany receivables, payables, loans, notes and investments then
existing between the Company, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company), on the other hand, other than advisory or
subadvisory fees arising in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
past practice, shall be settled by way of capital contribution (with respect to
intercompany payables or loans or notes due to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) or by way of dividend in kind (with respect to receivables of the
Company owed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including any amounts payable
under the license agreement dated October 21, 1992, between United Asset
Management Trademark Inc. and the Company, which shall be cancelled effective as
of the Closing with no continuing obligations thereafter). As of the Closing,
the Company shall have no long-term liabilities that would be required to be
reflected in a balance sheet (or the notes thereto) prepared in accordance with
GAAP (other than the real property leases set forth in Section 2.18 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule).

obligations of Holdings and OMAM to the Company under the provisions of the
Revenue Sharing Termination Agreement shall terminate without any liability on
the part of Holdings or OMAM and without any further action on the part of
Holdings, OMAM or the Company, and that the Company shall, as against Holdings
and OMAM, forthwith cease to have any rights thereunder and shall cease to be a

a dividend or against legally sufficient consideration, free and clear of any
Encumbrances. Prior to such transfer of the Shares, Holdings shall, and shall
cause OMAM to, take all corporate or limited liability company action necessary
to approve and effect such transfer.

under any applicable state or local income tax laws for the Company. Holdings,
the Company and Buyer shall, and Holdings shall cause OMAM to, report the

338 Form and Allocation Report, Holdings shall not have objected in writing to
such Section 338 Form or Allocation Report, such Section 338 Form and Allocation
Report shall be final and binding on both parties without any further

execute such Section 338 Form, and Buyer shall file such Section 338 Form with
the applicable taxing authority.

     (c) Buyer and Holdings agree that none of them shall, or shall permit any
of their Affiliates to, take any action to modify the Section 338 Forms
following the execution thereof, or to modify or revoke the Elections following
the filing of the Section 338 Forms, without the written consent of Buyer and
Holdings, as the case may be.

     (d) Buyer and Holdings shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the information contained

Affiliates to the extent arising out of or resulting from the breach of an
agreement or covenant made in this Article VIII by Buyer.

     (c) Payment in full of any amount due under this Section 8.3 shall be made

shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to the
Company.

     (c) For any Tax Return of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Period
or a taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
that is the responsibility of Buyer under Section 8.4(b), Buyer shall deliver to

unreasonably withheld or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return
(accompanied, where appropriate, by an allocation between the Pre-Closing Period

least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date (giving effect to any
validly obtained extension thereof).

hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written
notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto; provided, however, that the
failure of such party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other
party of any of its obligations under this Article VIII, except to the extent
that the other party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of
the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental
Authority.

     (b) Holdings shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any
audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any
taxing authority (a "Tax Proceeding") in respect of the Company for any taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i)
Holdings shall consult with Buyer before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax Proceeding if such Tax Proceeding could adversely
affect Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or, following the Closing Date, the
Company, and (ii) Holdings shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding, if such action would adversely affect Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer
or the Company, without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     (c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding for a taxable year or period of the
Company beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the Controlling
Party shall have the right to control, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding;
provided, however, that (i) the Controlling Party shall provide the
Non-controlling Party with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each
stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

Non-controlling Party before taking any significant action in connection with
such Tax Proceeding, (iii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the
Non-controlling Party and offer the Non-controlling Party an opportunity to
comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iv) the Controlling Party shall defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in

and "Non-controlling Party" shall mean whichever of Holdings or Buyer is not the
Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

     (d) Buyer shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any Tax
Proceeding involving the Company (other than any Tax Proceeding described in
Section 8.7(b) or (c)); provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall consult with
Holdings before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding if such Tax Proceeding could adversely affect Holdings or any
Affiliate of Holdings, and (ii) Buyer shall not settle, compromise or abandon
any such Tax Proceeding, if such action would adversely affect Holdings or any
Affiliate of Holdings, without obtaining the prior written consent of Holdings,

Holdings, OMAM or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company) on the one
hand and the Company on the other hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing
agreement in effect prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall
cease and terminate as of the Closing Date as to all past, present and future
taxable periods.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION


     Section 9.1. Indemnification by Holdings.

     (a) From and after the Closing, Holdings shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify Buyer, the Company and the LLC (the "Buyer Indemnitees"), against and
hold them harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred by any such Buyer
Indemnitee (other than a Loss relating to Taxes, for which the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 8.3 shall govern) arising from, relating to or
otherwise in respect of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by any of the Old Mutual Parties in or pursuant to Article II or
Article III of this Agreement (it being agreed that solely for purposes of
establishing whether any matter is indemnifiable pursuant to this clause (i),
the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Old Mutual
Parties shall be determined without giving effect to any qualifications relating
to materiality (including Company Material Adverse Effect)), (ii) any breach,
noncompliance or nonfulfillment by the Company or any Old Mutual Party of any
covenant, agreement or undertaking to be complied with or performed by any of
them pursuant to this Agreement (other than covenants, agreements or
undertakings set forth in Article VIII), (iii) any Controlled Group Liability,
and (iv) the Retained Liabilities (as defined in Item 1 of Schedule 2.13 of the
Company Disclose Schedule). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdings shall not be
required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any Shared Liabilities,
except as and to the extent set forth on Annex A.

     (b) Holdings shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee, and
shall not have any liability under Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than in respect of
any breach of the representations contained in Section 2.5 or Section 3.1)
unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Holdings would, but for this
Section 9.1(b), be liable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to $4,000,000 and then only to the extent of any such excess.

     Section 9.2. Indemnification by Buyer.

     (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Holdings, against and
hold it harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred by Holdings (other than
any Loss relating to Taxes, for which the indemnification provisions set forth
in Section 8.3 shall govern) arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect
of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in or pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement (it being agreed that solely for
purposes of establishing whether any matter is indemnifiable pursuant to this
clause (i), the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Buyer
shall be determined without giving effect to any qualifications relating to
materiality (including material adverse effect on Buyer)), (ii) any breach,
noncompliance or nonfulfillment by Buyer of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking to be complied with or performed by it pursuant to this Agreement
and (iii) the matters set forth on Exhibit 9.2(a) (the "Specified Liabilities").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Holdings

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

     (b) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Holdings, and shall not have
any liability under Section 9.2(a)(i) (other than in respect of any breach of
the representations contained in Section 4.8), unless the aggregate of all
Losses for which Buyer would, but for this Section 9.2(b), be liable thereunder
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $4,000,000 and then only to the
extent of any such excess.

     Section 9.3. Calculation and Payment of Losses.

     (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
Article VIII or this Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered
by the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and
shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost (other than a
reduction in Tax basis) incurred by the indemnified party arising from the
receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii)
reduced to take account of any net Tax Benefit realized by the indemnified party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss, in each case when and
as such Tax cost or Tax Benefit is actually realized through an increase or
reduction of Taxes otherwise due. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Consideration for Tax
purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a
Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the indemnified party or any of
its Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Consideration for United States Federal income Tax purposes.

     (b) Subject to Section 9.5(b), the aggregate indemnification obligations of
Holdings pursuant to this Article IX shall not exceed the Old Mutual Indemnity
Cap; provided, that such limitation shall not apply (i) to any Loss to the
extent related to an inaccuracy, breach, violation or nonfulfillment of any
provision in Article VIII, (ii) to any Loss to the extent resulting from a
breach of the representations contained in Section 2.5 or Section 3.1, (iii) to
any Loss to the extent related to any Controlled Group Liability, (iv) to any
Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section 9.1(a)(ii) or (v) to
any Losses in respect of Retained Liabilities (a "Buyer Indemnity Limitation
Exception"); provided, further, that in the case of clause (ii), the aggregate
indemnification obligation of Holdings with respect thereto, and without
consideration of any other amounts that may be due under this Article IX, shall
not exceed $140 million.

     (c) Subject to Section 9.5(b), the aggregate indemnification obligations of
Buyer pursuant to this Article IX shall not exceed the Buyer Indemnity Cap;
provided that such limitation shall not apply (i) to any Loss to the extent
related to an inaccuracy, breach, violation or nonfulfillment of any provision
in Article VIII, or (ii) to any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Section 9.2(a)(iii) (an "Old Mutual Indemnity Limitation
Exception").

     Section 9.4. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any Person pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a) shall
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or covenant terminates
pursuant to Section 10.3; provided, that such obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to
be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a bona fide claim by delivering a notice of such claim pursuant
to Section 9.5 to


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

the indemnifying party; and provided, further, that in the event of a Buyer
Indemnity Limitation Exception or an Old Mutual Indemnity Limitation Exception,
the obligation to indemnify shall continue until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

     Section 9.5. Procedures.

     (a) Third Party Claims. In order for a Person (the "Indemnified Party") to
be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 9.1 or 9.2 in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third Person against
the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly
following receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party, as promptly as practicable following the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim that are not
separately addressed to the indemnifying party.

     (b) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified
Party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the indemnifying party
so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. Notwithstanding the election of the indemnifying party to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim, and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel (i) if the parties to any such action or
proceeding (including impleaded parties) include any of the Old Mutual Parties
(other than the Company) and representation of both parties would, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, be inappropriate due to
a conflict of interest or (ii) if the indemnifying party shall not have employed
counsel (other than counsel that is reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Party) within a reasonable time after the Indemnified Party has given notice of
the institution of a Third Party Claim in compliance with Section 9.5(a). The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof; provided that such
counsel is not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party. If the
indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and



                                      -59-
<PAGE>

explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or
offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if the indemnifying
party withholds its consent to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, Losses with
respect to which would be subject to the Buyer Indemnity Cap or the Old Mutual
Indemnity Cap, (i) for an amount equal to or less than the Buyer Indemnity Cap
or the Old Mutual Indemnity Cap, as the case may be, minus any amounts
previously paid by the indemnifying party or parties for Losses subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), as applicable, and the Third
Party Claim ultimately results in Losses in excess of such amount, the
indemnifying party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for all Losses from
such Claim (notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 9.3(b) or
Section 9.3(c), as applicable) or (ii) for an amount in excess of the Buyer
Indemnity Cap or the Old Mutual Indemnity Cap, as applicable, minus any amounts
previously paid by the indemnifying party or parties for Losses subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), as applicable, and the Third
Party Claim ultimately results in Losses in excess of the proposed settlement
amount, the indemnifying party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party
(notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), as
applicable) for all Losses from such Third Party Claim less an amount equal to
the difference between (A) the amount of the proposed settlement to which the
indemnifying party did not consent and (B) the Buyer Indemnity Cap or the Old
Mutual Indemnity Cap, as the case may be, minus any amount previously paid by
the indemnifying party or parties for Losses subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), as applicable. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to
any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise materially
adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

     (c) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.1 or 9.2 that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with
reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to Sections 9.5 and
10.3, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to
such Indemnified Party under Section 9.1 or 9.2, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced by such failure.

     Section 9.6. Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that, from and after the Closing, except (i) in the case of common law
fraud, (ii) with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are
available or (iii) with respect to claims in respect of Taxes (which shall be
governed by Article VIII), the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto
with respect to any and all monetary claims arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant set forth herein shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX.

Buyer Indemnitees and Holdings and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

representations and warranties contained herein by any of the Old Mutual
Parties, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any of the Old Mutual
Parties, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or (ii) compliance with
any of the agreements, covenants or conditions contained herein, shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party or
parties against whom the waiver is to be effective. No such waiver shall
constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
inaccuracy, breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this
Agreement. Buyer shall not be permitted to waive the Company's compliance with
Section 5.15(b) with respect to the payment required to be made thereunder to
any employee of the Company who has entered into an employment agreement with
Buyer and the Company, to be effective from and after the Closing, including the
Employment Agreements, without the prior written consent of such employee;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that with respect
to such persons who have not entered into such employment agreements, any such
waiver by Buyer of such compliance shall not be deemed to alter or affect the
Company's obligations to such employee under his or her existing employment
agreement.

     Section 10.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, any other schedules, certificates, lists and documents referred to
herein, and any documents executed by the parties simultaneously herewith or
pursuant thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto, except as provided herein, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, discussions, negotiations and
communications, written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

     Section 10.3. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument executed
and delivered in fulfillment of the requirements of this Agreement, and any
covenants or other agreements the performance of which is specified to occur on
or prior to the Closing Date or the Closing, shall survive the Closing until
March 31, 2004, except that the representations and warranties in Sections 2.5,
2.10(c), 2.14, 3.1 and 8.1 shall not terminate, but shall continue until the
expiration of the statute of limitations relating thereto. All covenants or
other agreements which by their terms are required to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for such lesser period of time
as may be specified herein.

     Section 10.4. No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Articles II and III of this
Agreement and in Section 8.1 or as may be set forth in any closing certificate
delivered hereunder, neither Holdings nor the Company nor any other Affiliate of
Parent (within the meaning of the first sentence only of the definition of
"Affiliate") makes any express or implied representation or warranty on behalf
of Holdings or the Company, and Holdings and the Company hereby disclaim any
such representation or warranty whether by Holdings, the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates (within the meaning of the first sentence only of
the definition of "Affiliate"), officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives or any other Person. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article IV of this Agreement or as may be set forth in
any closing certificate delivered hereunder, Buyer makes no express or implied
representation or warranty, and Buyer hereby disclaims any such representation
or warranty whether by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (within the meaning of the
first sentence only of the definition of "Affiliate"), officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives or any other Person.

     Section 10.5. Interpretation.

     (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Schedules,
such reference shall be to a Section of or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of this
Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first
paragraph of this Agreement.

     (b) Each of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Seller Disclosure Schedule
and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall set forth items the disclosure of which
is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of
such party's representations or warranties or one or more of its covenants
contained in Article V, in each case making reference to the particular section
of this Agreement requiring such disclosure or to which exception is being
taken. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence,
disclosure of information in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall constitute
disclosure of such information for the purposes of each other section of such
disclosure schedule but only to the extent that the specific relevance of such
disclosure as an exception to the representation, warranty or covenant
corresponding to such other section of such disclosure schedule is readily
apparent from such disclosure. The inclusion of any information in any section
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule or other document delivered by any of the parties hereto
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
the materiality of such item, nor shall it establish a standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever.

     Section 10.6. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the


                                      -62-
<PAGE>

remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other
jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

     Section 10.7. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if
(i) delivered in person, (ii) transmitted by telecopy (with written confirmation
and a copy of the notice or other communication mailed by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested) or (iii) delivered by an express
courier (with written confirmation), to the parties at the following addresses
