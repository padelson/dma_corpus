 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 18, 2005 (this "Agreement"), among JOHNSON ELECTRIC HOLDINGS LIMITED, a Bermuda corporation ("JE Holdings"), J.E.C. ELECTRONICS SUB ONE, INC., a Massachusetts corporation and an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of JE Holdings ("Parent"), J.E.C. ELECTRONICS SUB TWO, INC., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and PARLEX CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used herein as defined terms are defined in Annex A hereof. 

  

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for JE Holdings, indirectly, through Parent and Purchaser, to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company is willing to enter this Agreement with Parent and Purchaser only if JE Holdings is also a party hereto, and as an inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, JE Holdings has agreed to be a party hereto; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have each approved the merger (the "Merger") of Purchaser with and into the Company in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, as amended (the "MBCA"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") (shares of Company Common Stock being hereafter collectively referred to as "Shares") not owned directly or indirectly by JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive $6.75 in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS, JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

Article I. 

   

The Merger 

   

 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.1, Parent may elect instead, at any time after Stockholder Approval (as hereinafter defined) is granted, to merge the Company into Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly 

   ##### 

  

 

owned Subsidiary of JE Holdings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be deemed to have breached any of its representations, warranties
or covenants by reason of such election. In such event, the parties agree to
execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the
foregoing and to provide, as the case may be, that Purchaser or such
other wholly owned Subsidiary of JE Holdings shall be the Surviving
Corporation and that JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with notice provisions and
other terms of the outstanding Convertible Notes, Preferred Shares and
Warrants. 

   

 1.2. Effective Time; Closing. No later than three Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger with the Secretary of State of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in such forms as are required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MBCA (the date and time of such filing being the "Effective Time" and such articles, the "Articles of Merger"). On the date of such filing, a closing shall be held at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, One International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, or such other place as the parties shall agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VII. 

  

 1.3. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in Section 11.07 of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.4. Articles of Organization; By-laws. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.6(a), the articles of organization of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such articles of organization. 

  

 (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, and subject to Section 6.6(a), the by-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation and such by-laws. 

  

 1.5. Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of organization and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or approval. The Company shall take all commercially reasonable action to cause Purchasers appointees to be duly elected as directors and officers of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, effective as of the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.6. Section 338(g) Election. At the election of Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, Parent may make the election provided under Section 338(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") (including under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction) with respect to the Company and all Subsidiaries of the Company. 

  

Article II. 

   

Conversion of Securities. 

   

 2.1. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; 

  

 (b) Each Share and Preferred Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share and Preferred Share owned by JE Holdings, Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of JE Holdings or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be converted into the right to receive $6.75, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "Common Share Merger Consideration"), less any required withholding taxes; 

  

 (d) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Liquidation Value thereof, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest or additional dividends thereon (the "Preferred Share Merger Consideration" and together with the Common Share Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), less any required withholding taxes. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be responsible for delivering to the Paying Agent (as hereinafter defined) a list of holders of Preferred Shares and such information as is in the Companys possession and necessary to ensure proper withholding; and 

  

 (e) From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares and Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares or Preferred Shares, as applicable, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.4, without interest thereon. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.2. Employee Stock Options. (a) The Company shall take all reasonable action to, as of the Effective Time (i) terminate the stock option plans listed in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, (as hereinafter defined) each as amended through the date of this Agreement (the "Company Stock Option Plans"); and (ii) cancel, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under the Company Stock Option Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised as of such time. Subject to the foregoing, each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent (as hereinafter defined) on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, immediately after the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Common Share Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time (the "Option Consideration"). Any such payment shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be responsible for delivering to the Paying Agent (i) a list of holders of Company Stock Options, (ii) calculations showing the respective amount of Option Consideration for each Company Stock Option, and (iii) such information as is requested by Paying Agent and in the Companys possession and necessary to ensure proper withholding. 

  

 (b) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to approve the disposition of the Company Stock Options in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions") so as to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 

  

 2.3. Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who have demanded properly, and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section 13.02 of the MBCA (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 13.02 of the MBCA, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect, or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights under such Section 13.02 of the MBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.4, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares that is communicated in writing to the Company, written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 13.02 of the MBCA and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section 13.02 of the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.4. Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books; Payment for Options. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company in the United States and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of Shares, Preferred Shares and Company Stock Options, as the case may be, to receive the funds to which holders of Shares, Preferred Shares and Company Stock Options shall become entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.2(a). Prior to the Effective Time, JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Consideration. If, for any reason, such funds are inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Shares, Preferred Shares and Company Stock Options shall be entitled under Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.2(a), JE Holdings shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.2(a), and, as of the Effective Time, JE Holdings and the Surviving Corporation shall become liable for payment thereof. The funds so deposited with the Paying Agent shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by JE Holdings or Parent. 

  

 (b) Promptly, but in no event more than five Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares or Preferred Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) or 2.1(d) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares or Preferred Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and compliance with the standard procedures of the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share or Preferred Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. 

  

 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this Article II;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent may require the delivery of a reasonable 

   ##### 

  

 

indemnity or bond against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate or ownership thereof. 

   

 (d) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Stock Options, the Option Consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(a). 

  

 (e) At any time following the ninth month after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares, Preferred Shares or Company Stock Options (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration or Option Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share, Preferred Share or Company Stock Option for any Merger Consideration or Option Consideration delivered in respect of such Share, Preferred Share or Company Stock Option to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 

  

 (f) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares or Preferred Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares, Preferred Shares and Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, Preferred Shares and Company Stock Options except as otherwise provided herein or by Applicable Law. 

  

Article III. 

   

Representations and Warranties of the Company 

   

 Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the written Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Disclosure Schedule") or, except as specifically set forth in Section 3.7, as disclosed in an SEC Report (as defined in Section 3.9) filed prior to the date hereof, the Company makes the representations and warranties to JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser that are set forth below. Each exception set forth in the Disclosure Schedule is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or subsection of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information disclosed therein under any section number shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule where such disclosure would be appropriate and readily apparent. The Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement. 

  

 3.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good 

   ##### 

  

 

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

 (b) Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and authorized and outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company. Except as disclosed in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity. 

  

 3.2. Articles of Organization and By-laws. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the articles of organization and the by-laws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary.

and, except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, each such

security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on the Companys or any Subsidiarys voting rights,

 3.4. Authority Relative to This Agreement. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.6 below), to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, obtaining Stockholder Approval, if and to the extent required by Applicable Law, and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the MBCA). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally; and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. 

  

 3.5. Board Approvals and Takeover Laws. The Company Board of Directors (the "Board"), at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined, as of the date of this Agreement, that this Agreement and the Merger, taken together, are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company; (ii) duly and validly approved, as of the date of this Agreement, and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board to authorize the Transactions; and (iii) resolved to recommend, as of the date of this Agreement, that the stockholders of the Company accept, approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, and none of the aforesaid actions by the Board has been amended, rescinded or modified except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.8, the actions taken by the Board are sufficient to render inapplicable to JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Merger, the provisions of Chapters 110C and 110F of the Massachusetts Corporation-Related Laws, as amended (the "MCRL"). To the Companys knowledge, no other state takeover statute, or other state law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares, is applicable to the Transactions. 

  

 3.6. Required Vote. The affirmative vote of the stockholders of two-thirds of the outstanding Shares, voting as a single class, is the only vote of the stockholders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock necessary to approve the Merger (the "Stockholder Approval"). 

  

 3.7. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of its obligations under this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement shall not, (i) conflict with or violate the articles of organization
or by-laws or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any
Subsidiary; (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 3.7(b) have been obtained and all filings
and obligations described in Section 3.7(b) have been made and, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to obtaining Stockholder Approval, conflict with or
violate any Applicable Law or by which any property or asset of the Company
or any Subsidiary is bound or affected; or (iii) subject to obtaining the
consents listed in Section 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedule, which list does
not incorporate information from or consents listed in the SEC
Reports, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give
to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property
or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. 

   

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Exon-Florio provision pursuant to Section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (amending Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950) (the "Exon-Florio Provision") and the requirements in the countries where a merger filing will be necessary and filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the MCBA (the "Company Required Approvals"); and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete list of Company Required Approvals and the countries where a merger filing is necessary, except for countries where the failure to file would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and does not incorporate information from, or consents listed in, the SEC Reports. 

  

 3.8. Permits; Compliance. 

  

 (a) Except with respect to Environmental Permits (as defined and addressed in Section 3.18) , each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits") except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, 

   ##### 

  

 

threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Permits would not prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) After giving effect to the Transactions, to the knowledge of the Company, all such licenses, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations will continue to be valid and in full force and effect, except as set forth in Section 3.8(b) of the Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with Applicable Laws by which the property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are bound or affected. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement with or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority that would, as of the date hereof, prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 3.9. SEC Filings; Financial Statements. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or obtained an extension of the time for filing) each form, report, schedule, registration statement, registration exemption, if applicable, definitive proxy statement and other document (together with all amendments thereof and supplements thereto) required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since June 30, 2003 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been amended or supplemented, the "SEC Reports"). Those SEC Reports that were not amended or supplemented complied and all SEC Reports that amended and supplemented previous filings complied, as of their respective dates, as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Reports, in each case to the extent in effect on the date of filing. Each of the SEC Reports did not, when filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Reports, and to the knowledge of the Company, the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For purposes of the preceding sentence and Section 3.9(f) hereof, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, the notes, if any, thereto) included in the SEC Reports (the "Financial Statements") complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q or 8-K or the applicable rules of the SEC) and fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments that were not or are not expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the consolidated financial position of the Company) the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended. The Companys foreign Subsidiaries maintain their books pursuant to local accounting rules and adjust their books to conform to GAAP for consolidation purposes. Therefore, the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP.

 (e) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

 (f) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to enable the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Company, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications

Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement and to its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law as advised by independent counsel, each of the Company, JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting at the earliest practicable time. 

  

 (b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company, JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or 

   ##### 

  

 

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act. 

   

 6.2. Stockholders Meeting. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and to its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law as advised by independent counsel, as promptly as practicable following the date that the Company has received confirmation that the staff of the SEC has no comments or no further comments on the Proxy Statement, the Company, acting through its Board, and in accordance with Applicable Law and the Companys articles of organization and by-laws, shall (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Transactions (the "Stockholders Meeting"); (ii) include in the Proxy Statement, and not subsequently withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser the recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions; and (iii) use its best efforts to obtain such approval and adoption. At the Stockholders Meeting, JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser shall cause all Shares then owned by them and their Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions. 

  

 6.3. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and agents of JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser reasonable access at reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and shall furnish JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data and information ("Confidential Information") as JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser, through their officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request.

 (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. 

  

 6.4. No Solicitation of Transactions. 

  

 (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, agent or otherwise, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, including a Superior Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person, any non-public information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except that the Company may take any action referred to in this clause (ii) if (I) the Board determines in good faith, after having received advice from outside legal counsel, that such action is consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under Applicable 

   ##### 

  

 

Law, (II) the Board determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (III) after giving
prior written notice to JE Holdings and entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal, not solicited, initiated or
knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 6.4, made by a third person
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, 50% or more of the outstanding equity securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or
a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, if and only if, the Board reasonably determines (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) (i) that the
proposed transaction would be more favorable from a financial point of view
to its stockholders than the Merger and the Transactions taking into account
at the time of determination any changes to the terms of this Agreement that
as of that time had been proposed by JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser; and
(ii) that the person or entity making such Superior Proposal is capable of
consummating such Acquisition Proposal (based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the degree of certainty of obtaining
financing, the expectation of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the
identity and background of such person). 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(b), neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of Stockholder Approval, the Board determines in good faith (i) after having received advice from outside counsel, that such action is consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under Applicable Law; and (ii) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board or a committee thereof, as applicable, may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger. 

  

 (c) The Company shall, and shall direct or cause its directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (d) The Company shall promptly advise JE Holdings orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request; (ii) any material changes in any such Acquisition Proposal or request; and (iii) any non-public information concerning the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to such person or its representatives, which was not previously provided to JE Holdings. 

  

 (e) The Company agrees, except as consistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, after having received advice from outside legal counsel, not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party, except as may be necessary to submit an Acquisition Proposal hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.5. Employee Benefits Matters. (a) JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser agree that following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and successors shall provide those persons who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries ("Retained Employees") with employee plans and programs which provide benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of JE Holdings. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes of accrual of seniority with respect to termination or severance benefits and eligibility to participate and vesting and benefit accrual (but, except as required by Applicable Law, not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement that is established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and in which such employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Subsidiary;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In addition, with respect to any medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefit plan of JE Holdings in which employees of the Company may participate following the Effective Time (a "New Plan"), JE Holdings shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements to be waived for such employees and their covered dependents ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such waiver shall not apply to any pre-existing condition that excluded any such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time from the corresponding Plan maintained by the Company) and shall provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by an employee or an employees covered dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions under the relevant New Plan after the Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses are taken into account for the benefit of similarly situated employees of JE Holdings and its Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.5, nothing shall require JE Holdings to provide the Retained Employees with any particular employee benefit plans, agreements, or programs or preclude or limit JE Holdings ability to modify, amend, or terminate any New Plan or any of the Companys Plans as it deems appropriate. 

  

 (b) In addition, JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser shall provide severance arrangements to the individuals set forth in Schedule 6.5(b) for the time periods and for the amounts contained therein. 

  

 6.6. Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The articles of organization and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than as are set forth in Article 6D of the Companys articles of organization, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) JE Holdings shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor to the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including any obligation to advance funds for expenses) from and after the Effective Time, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company 

   ##### 

  

 

or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against
any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, Action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (i)
arising out of or pertaining to the Transactions; or (ii) otherwise with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
to the same extent as provided in the Companys articles of organization or
by-laws or any applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date
hereof, in each case for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the
event of any such claim, Action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by Massachusetts law,
pay the expenses incurred by the Indemnified Parties from time to time in
advance of the disposition of such claim, Action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, including the reasonable fees of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.6(b))
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any single action except to the extent that two or more of such
Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such
action; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim. 

   

 (c) JE Holdings shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use its best efforts to maintain in effect, for six years from the Effective Time, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to matters occurring at and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of similar coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to such directors and officers; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $140,000 per annum in the aggregate);  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by this Section 6.6(c) for such aggregate premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much insurance (up to the amount of insurance required by this Section 6.6(c)) as is possible for such aggregate premium. 

  

 (d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at JE Holdings option, JE Holdings, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. 

  

 (e) JE Holdings guarantees that if for any reason the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall not meet its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.6, it shall meet such obligations in full when and as such obligations arise. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.7. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to JE Holdings, and JE Holdings shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which reasonably could be expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect from the date hereof until the Effective Time; and (ii) any failure of the Company, JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Each of JE Holdings and Company shall furnish promptly, or cause to be furnished promptly, to the FTC, the Antitrust Division and any other requesting Governmental Authority any additional information requested by either of them pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust notification in connection with such filings. JE Holdings and Company shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with the making of all such filings or responses, including providing copies of all such documents to the other party and its advisors prior to filing or responding.

 6.10. Public Announcements. JE Holdings and the Company agree that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions or the Merger shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United States securities exchange (including, without limitation, the listing requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange), in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

  

 6.11. Consents and Approvals; Commercially Reasonable Efforts. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and subject to Section 6.4, except to the extent that, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, the Company Board determines that to do so would not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under Applicable Law, JE Holdings, 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree to use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary and appropriate,
under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable including, but not limited to (i) the preparation
and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Transactions and the taking of such actions as are reasonably
necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or

to be obtained prior to Closing. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to, and provide the other party (or its counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the Transactions unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law.

To the extent that transfers, amendments or modifications of Permits (including environmental Permits) are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or consummation of the Transactions, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers.

 (d) For purposes of this Section 6.11, "commercially reasonable efforts" of JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser shall not require JE Holdings, Parent and Purchaser to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement which would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or by JE Holdings, Parent, Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries, of all or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries, or compel JE Holdings, Parent or Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries to

 6.12. State Takeover Laws.
