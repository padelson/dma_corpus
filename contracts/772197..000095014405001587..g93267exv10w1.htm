neither PSI nor Phoenix has (i)&nbsp;heretofore been subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between IVAX and PSI
executed prior to the date hereof, nothing herein shall require PSI or Phoenix to disclose any
information to IVAX if such disclosure would in PSI&#146;s reasonable discretion after consulting with
its legal counsel (i)&nbsp;jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii)&nbsp;contravene
any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which PSI, Phoenix or any of their Affiliates
is a party), it being understood that in the case of clause (ii)&nbsp;above that PSI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents or waivers as would permit such disclosure.

Confidentiality Agreement) until the Closing. In the event this Agreement is abandoned or
terminated, each party shall upon request promptly return to the other any statements, documents,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither PSI nor Phoenix shall
have any obligation to indemnify any Director/Officer Indemnitee in connection with, as a result of

IVAX desires to effect a merger or assignment or similar corporate reorganization of PSI or
Phoenix, it shall cause the successor or survivor to assume all of the PSI&#146;s and Phoenix&#146;s
obligations as to the foregoing matters in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Director/Officer
Indemnitees. In addition, Phoenix shall be entitled to purchase &#147;tail&#148; coverage prior to the

amount of coverage paid to any IVAX Indemnified Person under any title insurance policy in respect
of such Damages; provided, however, that IVAX shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to

action, claim or legal, administrative, arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution,
proceeding, audit or investigation by a third party (a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), an IVAX

describe in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnity hereunder. The failure to give
notice as required by this <U>Section&nbsp;7.4.1</U> in a reasonably prompt fashion shall not result in
a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that such failure actually

indemnity hereunder unless IVAX and the Seller&#146;s Representative agree that Seller&#146;s Representative

the Third Party Claim. In all other instances, the IVAX Indemnified Party may engage counsel to
defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers&#146; Representative; <U>provided</U> that that the IVAX Indemnified Party

Representative will indemnify IVAX, PSI, Phoenix and their respective Affiliates from any Damages
arising from or relating to any acts or omissions of the Sellers&#146; Representative in its capacity as
such. Any payment made by IVAX or any of its Affiliates to the Sellers&#146; Representative pursuant to
this Agreement shall constitute payment and satisfaction in full of such payor&#146;s obligation to make
such payment to the relevant Seller.

Every successor Sellers&#146; Representative appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to its predecessor, and also to IVAX and the Represented Holders, an instrument in writing,
reasonably satisfactory to IVAX and the Represented Holders, accepting such appointment hereunder,
and thereupon such successor Sellers&#146; Representative, without any further act, shall become fully
vested with all the rights, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all of the duties and
obligations, of its predecessor. Until a successor Sellers&#146; Representative has been appointed, no
such resignation shall be effective.
