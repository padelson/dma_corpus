When the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto was or is declared effective, it (i) complied or will comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Other than pursuant to the provisions of applicable Law, the Affiliate Letters and Standstill Agreements, or as a result of any Seller being an Affiliate of IVAX at any time, there are no restrictions upon the resale of the IVAX Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.3. To the Knowledge of IVAX, no Seller is as of the date of this Agreement nor will become upon Closing an Affiliate of IVAX.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between IVAX and PSI executed prior to the date hereof, nothing herein shall require PSI or Phoenix to disclose any information to IVAX if such disclosure would in PSIs reasonable discretion after consulting with its legal counsel (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (ii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which PSI, Phoenix or any of their Affiliates is a party), it being understood that in the case of clause (ii) above that PSI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents or waivers as would permit such disclosure.

 6.5 _Notification_. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing of the occurrence, or threatened occurrence, of any event, condition, circumstance, transaction or other item that would itself, or with any notice, lapse of time or both, constitute a material breach or violation of this Agreement by any party, that would cause any representation or warranty made by the notifying party in this Agreement to be materially false or misleading, or that would have been required to have been disclosed in this Agreement had such event, condition, circumstance, transaction or other item existed on the date hereof. PSI shall, and PSI shall cause Phoenix to, promptly notify IVAX of any event of which PSI or Phoenix obtains Knowledge which could adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties, business, operations or prospects of PSI or Phoenix.

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees (and PSI shall cause Phoenix) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 6.16.2 To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such plans or arrangements, IVAX shall give employees of PSI or Phoenix immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of the level of benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by IVAX or any subsidiary of IVAX or any subsidiary of IVAX for such Company Employees service with Phoenix or PSI to the same extent recognized by PSI or Phoenix immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit. To the extent requested by IVAX reasonably in advance of the Closing, PSI and Phoenix shall each take all corporate action and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take any other action required to terminate, effective as of the Closing Date, each PSI Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement subject to Section 401(k) of the Code.   

 6.17 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, PSI and Phoenix will indemnify the individuals who at or prior to the Closing were directors or officers of PSI or Phoenix (collectively, the " _Director/Officer Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Closing, to the fullest extent (A) required by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of PSI or Phoenix in effect on the date hereof and (B) permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither PSI nor Phoenix shall have any obligation to indemnify any Director/Officer Indemnitee in connection with, as a result of or in any way relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If IVAX desires to effect a merger or assignment or similar corporate reorganization of PSI or Phoenix, it shall cause the successor or survivor to assume all of the PSIs and Phoenixs obligations as to the foregoing matters in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Director/Officer Indemnitees. In addition, Phoenix shall be entitled to purchase "tail" coverage prior to the Closing, provided that the cash portion of the purchase price set forth in Article II will be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the premium amount in excess of the lesser of (x) one-half of the premium and (y) $25,000.00 . If PSI or Phoenix makes any payment to a Director/Officer Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 6.17_, PSI or Phoenix, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the extent of any such payments against any such "tail" policy.   

 6.18 _Tax Matters_.   

 6.18.1 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods or relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes.   

 6.18.2 _Amended Tax Returns_. IVAX, PSI, and Phoenix shall not amend (or cause to be amended) any Tax return of PSI or Phoenix filed with respect to any taxable period ending on or before or including the Closing Date without the consent of the Sellers Representative if the effect of such filing would, in the reasonable judgment of the Sellers Representative, increase the exposure for indemnity pursuant to _Section 7.3_ of this Agreement.   

 6.18.3 _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. IVAX, PSI, and Phoenix shall provide the Sellers Representative with drafts of all Tax returns covering periods or portions of periods prior    ##### 

  

  

to the Closing Date no later than thirty (30) days prior to earlier of the due
date (including any extensions thereof) or filing date thereof, to the extent
claims for indemnification may be made with respect to such Tax returns
hereunder. All such Tax returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
similar Tax returns heretofore filed by PSI and Phoenix, except as
required by law. The Sellers Representative shall have the right to review
and provide comments on such Tax returns during the fifteen (15)-day period
following the receipt of such Tax returns, provided that such fifteen
(15)-day period shall be extended by one (1) day for each day after the
second business day following the request from the Sellers Representative
that IVAX does not provide information reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative in connection with the Sellers Representatives review of
such Tax returns. The Sellers Representative and IVAX shall consult with
each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result
of such Tax returns and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items
shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline
for filing such Tax return) by an internationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen by both IVAX and the Sellers Representative. Upon
resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed
on that basis.   

 6.18.4 _Tax Refunds_. Any Taxes of PSI and Phoenix that are paid pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 7.3_ of this Agreement and are later refunded to, or credited against a Tax liability of, IVAX, PSI, Phoenix, or their Affiliates shall promptly be paid over to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the former holders of shares of PSI Common Stock and PSI Warrants).   

ARTICLE 7 
  _Survival; Investigation; Indemnification_     

 7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of PSI and the Sellers made in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the First Expiration Date, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.27_ shall survive until the Final Expiration Date. Notice must be given of any claim for indemnification in respect of any alleged breach of a representation, warranty or covenant under _Section 7.3_ prior to the First Expiration Date, as to any claim other than a claim arising under Section 3.27, and as to any claim so arising under _Section 3.27_, notice must be given of any claim for indemnification in respect of any alleged breach of such representation and warranty prior to the Final Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties of each Seller set forth in _Section 4.4_ shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and notice must be given of any claim for indemnification in respect of any alleged breach of _Section 4.4_ under _Section 7.3_ prior to such time.   

 7.2 _Investigation_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall not be affected or diminished in any way by the receipt of any notice pursuant to _Section 6.5_ or by any investigation (or failure to investigate) at any time by or on behalf of the party for whose benefit such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements were made.   

 7.3 _Indemnification_.   

 7.3.1 Subsequent to the Closing and subject to the limitations contained in this _Article 7_ , PSI and each Seller, to the extent set forth in the Escrow Agreement, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless IVAX and its Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders,    ##### 

  

  

employees and agents (each such indemnified party, an " _IVAX Indemnified
Party_ ") from, against and in respect of Damages incurred by any of them
arising from (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of PSI or any
Seller in this Agreement (when made, except in the case of each of the
representations and warranties that by their terms are made solely as of a
specified date, in which case breaches shall be measured only as of such
specified date) or (b) a breach or violation of any covenant of PSI or the
Sellers in this Agreement. As used herein, the term " _Damages_ " shall mean
any and all liabilities, damages, claims, deficiencies, fines, assessments,
losses, penalties, interest, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs), but shall not include any
incidental, consequential or punitive damages or any claim for loss of
value.   

 7.3.2 PSI and the Sellers shall have no obligation for Damages under _Section 7.3.1_ unless and until the aggregate of all Damages (aggregating all claims for Damages under _Section 7.3.1_ ) exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (the " _Basket Limitation_ ") (at which point PSI and the Sellers shall become liable only for amounts in excess of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000)). In no event will PSI and the Sellers liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters in _Section 7.3.1_ exceed in the aggregate the lesser of (a) twelve million five hundred thousand dollars ($12,500,000) and (b) the then-current market value of the Subsequent IVAX Shares Consideration (the " _Cap Limitation_ "). The Basket Limitation shall not apply to any claim for indemnification in respect of any dispute with any Seller or any assertion by any Seller of appraisal rights in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any short-form merger undertaken as contemplated by _Section 2.3_. Neither the Basket Limitation nor the Cap Limitation shall apply to any claim for indemnification against any Seller in respect of any dispute arising from such Sellers breach or violation of any of the representations and warranties of such Seller set forth in _Section 4.4_.   

 7.3.3 Except as set forth in the last sentence of _Section 7.3.2_ above, any indemnification required to be made by PSI or the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.3.1_ shall be satisfied solely and exclusively pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement by claim against the Subsequent IVAX Shares Consideration.   

 7.3.4 The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this _Article 7_ shall be net of any specific reserve attributable to the subject matter of the related claim, as reflected on the portion of the work papers to the Most Recent Balance Sheet set forth on  _Schedule 7.3.4_. In addition, to the extent any Damages arise in respect of a breach of the representation and warranty as to real estate, Damages shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount of coverage paid to any IVAX Indemnified Person under any title insurance policy in respect of such Damages; provided, however, that IVAX shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of such coverage to the maximum extent allowable.   

 7.3.5 If the indemnitor makes any payment under this _Article 7_ in respect of any Damages, the Shareholders Representative shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment to the rights of the indemnified Person against any third party with respect to such Damages.   

 7.3.6 For purposes of paying indemnification under this _Section 7.3_, the value of a share of IVAX Common Stock as of any date of payment of such indemnification shall be deemed to be the average closing price of a share of IVAX Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange during the ten (10) trading days preceding the date which is two (2) business days prior to such date of payment of such indemnification.    ##### 

  

  

 7.3.7 IVAX agrees that the indemnification provisions of this _Article 7_ are intended to provide the exclusive remedy as to all Damages any IVAX Indemnified Party may incur arising from any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of PSI or the Sellers herein or otherwise from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and IVAX hereby waives any other rights or remedies that may arise under any applicable statute, rule or regulation.   

 7.3.8 Indemnification for breaches of the representations in _Section 3.27_ shall be limited to Taxes of PSI and Phoenix for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the pre-Closing portion of any taxable period that begins before but does not end on the Closing Date. For purposes of determining the Taxes that arise in a period that begins before but does not end on the Closing Date, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than those described in clause (ii), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, receipts, payroll, sales or other items of revenue or expense, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.   

 7.4 _Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under this _Article 7_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:   

 7.4.1 An IVAX Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative of any event or occurrence with respect to which the IVAX Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_; _provided_ that if such event or occurrence is a suit, action, claim or legal, administrative, arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution, proceeding, audit or investigation by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), an IVAX Indemnified Party shall give reasonably prompt notice thereof in writing. Each such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnity hereunder. The failure to give notice as required by this _Section 7.4.1_ in a reasonably prompt fashion shall not result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that such failure actually increases the liability of the indemnifying party for Damages hereunder.   

 7.4.2 The Sellers Representative shall not be entitled to assume the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim for which an IVAX Indemnified Party has indicated it intends to seek indemnity hereunder unless IVAX and the Sellers Representative agree that Sellers Representative shall so assume the defense or settlement, or unless IVAX fails to actually assume the defense of the Third Party Claim. In all other instances, the IVAX Indemnified Party may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers Representative; _provided_ that that the IVAX Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without the consent or agreement of the Sellers Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The expense of such counsel shall be considered Damages hereunder.   

 7.4.3 In cases where the IVAX Indemnified Party has assumed the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim, the Sellers Representative will reasonably cooperate with    ##### 

  

  

IVAX Indemnified Party, and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to
participate at its own cost in any such Third Party Claim or in any
negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate such Third Party
Claim.   

 7.4.4 In the event indemnification is requested, the Sellers Representative and its representatives and agents shall have access to the premises, books and records of IVAX, PSI and Phoenix, or parties seeking such indemnification, and their Affiliates to the extent reasonably necessary to assist it in defending or settling any action, proceeding or claim; _provided_  that such access shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of any such Person. Except as reasonably necessary to assist it in defending or settling such action, proceeding or claim, the IVAX Indemnified Party shall not be required (i) to disclose any information with respect to itself or any of its Affiliates (or former Affiliates) or (ii) to participate in the defense of any claim to be indemnified hereunder.   

 7.4.5 In the event that IVAX or its Affiliates (including PSI and Phoenix after the Closing Date) receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments or other disputes concerning Taxes with respect to which the Sellers may incur liability under _Article 7_ of this Agreement, the party in receipt of such notice shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative of such matter in writing and the Sellers Representative shall have the sole right to represent the interests of PSI and Phoenix in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to such Taxes; _provided_ that the Sellers Representative shall provide prompt notice to IVAX of any substantive meeting or telephone conference with any Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax matters and IVAX shall have the right to participate at its expense in any such meeting or conference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which would adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the IVAX or its affiliates (including PSI and Phoenix after the Closing Date) for periods after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of IVAX, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

 7.5 _Payment and Releases from the Escrow Account_.   

 7.5.1 Any claim against the Subsequent IVAX Shares Consideration (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be made by presentation to the Escrow Agent of (i) a letter signed by each of IVAX and the Sellers Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to pay any IVAX Indemnified Party a specified amount of Damages or (ii) a copy of a judgment or judicial order or decree to the effect that any IVAX Indemnified Party is entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ and the amount of Damages determined with respect to such claim (the amount of any such Damages, whether agreed or set forth in a judgment, judicial order or decree, the " _Indemnified Amount_ "). Upon presentation of any such letter, order or decree, the Escrow Agent shall release to the IVAX Indemnified Party a number of Shares of IVAX Common Stock equal in value, determined as set forth in _Section 7.3.6_, to the Indemnified Amount.   

 7.5.2 On the First Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the portion of the Escrow Fund then remaining in the escrow account with a value (determined as set forth in  _Section 7.3.6_) in excess of $2,000,000 to the former holders of shares of PSI Common Stock and PSI Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) in the event an audit in respect of PSI and Phoenixs 2002 federal income tax returns for the 2002 taxable year is then in progress, the amount so released shall instead be the portion of the Escrow Fund in excess of $4,000,000, determined as set forth in _Section 7.3.6_ and (ii) if any    ##### 

  

  

claim for indemnification as to other matters is pending on the First
Expiration Date and an amount in respect thereof has been asserted or agreed
upon by IVAX and the Sellers Representative that is less than the balance in
the Escrow Fund, then such distribution shall be net of the amount so
established and reserved in respect of such claim, with such retained amount
to be disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the
event an audit described in clause (i) above is commenced and completed prior
to September 15, 2007 without any claim against the Escrow Fund, the portion
of the Escrow Fund with a value in excess of $2,000,000 (determined as
aforesaid) will be promptly released.   

 7.5.3 On September 15, 2007, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the portion of the Escrow Fund then remaining in the escrow account with a value (determined as set forth in _Section 7.3.6_ ) in excess of $1,000,000 (or, if an audit in respect of PSI and Phoenixs 2002 federal income tax returns for the 2002 taxable year is then in progress, $3,000,000) to the former holders of shares of PSI Common Stock and PSI Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event an audit in respect of PSI and Phoenixs federal income tax returns for the 2003 taxable year through any period ending on or before the Closing Date is then in progress, such distribution shall be made only to the extent agreed upon as described in clause (ii) of _Section 7.5.2_. On the Final Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund to the former holders of PSI Common Stock and PSI Warrants in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; provided that if any claim for indemnification is then pending or any audit described above is then in progress, such distribution shall only be made to the extent agreed upon as described in clause (ii) of  _Section 7.5.2_.

 10.1.3 by IVAX, at any time after the Termination Date (or any extension thereof in accordance with _Section 10.1.2_ above), if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date (provided that the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date is not the result of the failure of IVAX or any of its Affiliates to perform or fulfill any of their respective obligations hereunder required to be performed at or prior to the Closing);

 10.1.5 by IVAX, upon written notice provided to the Sellers Representative, if there has been any material misrepresentation or breach or violation of any covenant, representation or warranty of PSI or any Seller in this Agreement which would cause the condition in Section 9.1 hereof not to be satisfied were it to remain in effect through the Closing    ##### 

  

  

Date and which is not cured within ten (10) business days after notice
thereof, but in any event prior to the Termination Date;   

 10.1.6 by the Sellers Representative, if any event or circumstance shall occur that renders the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of PSI and the Sellers set forth in  _Article 8_ (other than _Section 8.7_) impossible and such condition has not been waived by the Sellers Representative (provided that such event or condition is not the result of the failure of PSI or any of its Affiliates or any Seller to perform or fulfill any of their respective obligations hereunder required to be performed at or prior to the Closing); or

ARTICLE 11 
  _AGREEMENTS AMONG SELLERS_     

 11.1 _Appointment_. Effective as of the date hereof, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes, appoints, authorizes, directs and empowers LGP (the " _Sellers  Representative_") to act as sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of the Sellers (together, the " _Represented Holders_ "), with full power of substitution, with respect to all matters under this Agreement, including receiving notices hereunder, entering into any amendment or modification hereof, executing the Escrow Agreement, engaging special counsel, accountants or other advisors or incurring such other expenses on behalf of the Represented Holders, resolving any dispute hereunder including but not limited to any disputes relating to the matters arising under  _Article 7_ (Survival; Investigation; Indemnification) (whether by instituting any suit or action, or defending, settling or compromising any claim, waiving or refraining to enforce any right of the Represented Holders or taking any other action), or doing any and all things and taking any and all actions, in each case that the Sellers Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other documents or instruments entered into in connection herewith. The Sellers each hereby agree that effective upon Closing, the    ##### 

  

  

Stockholders Agreement shall terminate in full and shall be entirely
superseded by this Agreement.   

 11.2 _Indemnification of Sellers  Representative_. Neither the Sellers Representative nor any of its officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents or other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall incur any responsibility or liability whatsoever to any Represented Holder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue. Each Represented Holder shall indemnify, pro rata based upon such Holders ownership of PSI Common Stock (including PSI Warrants on an as exercised basis), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law each of the Sellers Representative and its Representatives against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including any and all expense whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of any claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Sellers Representative or its Representatives hereunder or otherwise. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the Sellers Representative hereunder for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Sellers Representative to the Represented Holders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each Represented Holder shall promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative full payment of his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to withhold any such amount from the amount distributable to any Represented Holder under this Agreement.   

 11.3 _Expenses_. The Sellers Representative also shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, each Represented Holder, pro rata based upon such Holders ownership of PSI Common Stock (including PSI Warrants on an as exercised basis), for any other expenses, charges or liabilities that the Sellers Representative incurs in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to an advance for such expenses in the amount of $350,000, which amount shall be retained, on a pro rata basis, by the Sellers Representative from amounts distributable to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.3.1_. Upon written notice from the Sellers Representative to the Represented Holders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such expenses, charges or liabilities, in excess of the $350,000 set aside for such purpose, each Represented Holder shall promptly deliver to the Sellers Representative full payment of his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to withhold any such amount from the amount distributable to any Represented Holder under this Agreement.   

 11.4 _Distribution of Payments_. Any payments received by the Sellers Representative pursuant to _Article 2_ (Sale and Purchase) shall be distributed as soon as practicable to the Sellers on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the PSI Common Stock and PSI Warrants sold by them to IVAX pursuant to this Agreement. Any amounts not needed in respect of the advance for    ##### 

  

  

expenses set forth in _Section 11.3_ shall be similarly so distributed no
later than the date of the final distribution pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.   

 11.5 _Reliance_. IVAX and PSI shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document and upon all of such actions or omissions being legally binding upon the Sellers, without any obligation to inquire of, or liability to, any holder of PSI Securities notwithstanding any Knowledge of any dispute or disagreement. The Sellers Representative will indemnify IVAX, PSI, Phoenix and their respective Affiliates from any Damages arising from or relating to any acts or omissions of the Sellers Representative in its capacity as such. Any payment made by IVAX or any of its Affiliates to the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute payment and satisfaction in full of such payors obligation to make such payment to the relevant Seller.   

 11.6 _Successor_. If at any time hereafter LGP shall resign or otherwise become incapable of acting as the Sellers Representative, a successor Sellers Representative shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers, in accordance with their former respective ownership of PSI Common Stock (including PSI Warrants on an as exercised basis). Every successor Sellers Representative appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor, and also to IVAX and the Represented Holders, an instrument in writing, reasonably satisfactory to IVAX and the Represented Holders, accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Sellers Representative, without any further act, shall become fully vested with all the rights, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all of the duties and obligations, of its predecessor. Until a successor Sellers Representative has been appointed, no such resignation shall be effective.   

 11.7 _Survival; Binding Effect_. The grant of authority provided for in this  _Article 11_ (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Represented Holder and (ii) shall survive the Closing, and any action taken by the Sellers Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Agreement shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Represented Holder notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such Represented Holder, except for actions or omissions of the Sellers Representative constituting willful misconduct. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Sellers Representative under this _Article 11_ shall survive the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement.
