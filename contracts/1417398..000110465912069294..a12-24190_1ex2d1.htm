 **Whereas** :

 



 

(A) Coperion Capital GmbH (the " **Target Company** ") is a limited liability
company incorporated under German law. The Target Company is registered with
the commercial register of the local court of Stuttgart under HR B 726123\.
The Target Company has issued two different classes of shares and currently
has a total registered share capital ( _Stammkapital_ ) of EUR 2,000,000,
divided into Class A shares in the nominal amount of EUR 500,000 and Class B
shares in the nominal amount of EUR 1,500,000. The exact allocation of the
share capital  including the Class A shares in the nominal amount of EUR
3,150 and EUR 600 held by the Target Company itself as its own shares (
_eigene Anteile_ ) according to sec. 33

 



      
 

 



 

limited liability company law ( _GmbHG_ )  is listed in column B. of
_Schedule (A)_ hereto (all shares in the Company, the " **Shares** ").

 



 

(B) The Target Company directly or indirectly holds all shares in Coperion
GmbH and in the entities further described in _Schedule (B)_ (together the "
**Subsidiaries** "). The Target Company and each of the Subsidiaries are
herein referred to as a " **Group Company** " and collectively as the "
**Group Companies** " or the " **Group** ".

 



 

(C) The Group is engaged worldwide in the business of compounding and
extrusion, materials handling and service and has a customer base of global
corporations and small to medium-sized enterprises in the plastics, chemicals,
food and aluminium industries. These activities as carried out by the Group on
the date of this Agreement are herein referred to as the " **Business** ".

 



 

(D) In 2010, Coperion GmbH entered into a sale and lease back transaction
regarding the two sites in Baienfurt and Stuttgart with Bricol TG 15 (Lux) S.a
r.l. In this context, Coperion GmbH granted a loan to the purchaser of the
respective real estate. As a result of said transaction, Coperion GmbH became
the owner of a loan receivable in the amount of EUR 16,300,000 against Bricol
TG 15 (Lux) S.a r.l. (" **Bricol** "), which is currently assigned to the
Existing Lenders under the Existing Financial Indebtedness (the " **Vendor
Loan** "). It is agreed between the Parties that the Vendor Loan commercially
shall not form part of the transaction under this Agreement and shall
therefore be carved-out prior to the consummation of the transaction.

 



 

(E) The Guarantor wishes to ensure the fulfilment of all obligations of the
Purchaser under and in connection with this Agreement as set out herein.

 



 

 **It is agreed** as follows:

 



 

 **1** ** ****Interpretation**

 



 

In this Agreement including the Recitals, unless the context otherwise
requires, the provisions of this Clause 1 apply:

The Share Purchase Price shall bear interest (the " **Regular Interest** ") as

until and excluding the date of actual payment (the " **Default Interest** ").

 



 

 **3.4** ** ****Escrow Account**

 



 

Prior to Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly appoint Commerzbank AG
or UniCredit Bank AG to serve as their joint agent (the " **Escrow Agent** ")

account, to which the Holdback is transferred upon Closing. The Holdback shall
be released to the Sellers 18 (eighteen) months after Closing, provided and to
the extent that at such time no claims against the Sellers or any of them have
been raised by the Purchaser according to Clauses 4, 9 to 11 or in connection

 **3.5.2** ** **To the extent that contrary to the Parties assumption and in
spite of the Sellers not having opted for VAT the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement are subject to VAT, the Purchaser shall pay such VAT in
addition to the Purchase Price. VAT on the Purchase Price is due for payment
as soon as the Purchaser has received from the relevant Seller an invoice
which complies with the provisions of sec. 14 of the German VAT Code (
_Umsatzsteuergeset_ z) or a respective other applicable foreign tax provision.

 



 

 **3.6** ** ****Impact of Payments on the Purchase Price**

 



 

If any payment or other performance is made by any of the Sellers to the
Purchaser or by the Purchaser to any of the Sellers in respect of any claim
under or in connection with this Agreement, the payment or in case of a non-
financial performance its financial value shall be treated as a correction of
the consideration paid by the Purchaser to the relevant Seller under this
Agreement and such consideration shall be deemed to have been reduced or
increased, as the case may be, by the amount of such payment.

 



 

 **3.7** ** ****No Netting**

in writing by the relevant Seller or have been confirmed by final decision of
a competent court ( _Gericht_ ) or arbitration panel ( _Schiedsgericht_ ).

 



 

 **3.7.2** ** **None of the Sellers shall be entitled to

or have been confirmed by final decision of a competent court ( _Gericht_ ) or
arbitration panel ( _Schiedsgericht_ ).

been aware of the relevant events as set out in Clause 5.1.3(i)(a) and (b)
above, (i) in case of a Purchaser MAC Notice, on the day of receipt of the
Purchaser MAC Notice by the Sellers, and (ii) in case of a Sellers MAC Notice,
on the day set out in the Sellers MAC Notice.

 



 

(f) Full curing of the Material Adverse Change for the purpose of Clauses (a)
and (b) above shall be deemed to have taken place, if the respective measures

financial thresholds provided in Clauses (b) and (c) are no longer met by more
than 90 per cent.

 



 

(ii) The Sellers shall notify the Purchaser before the Closing in writing and
in sufficient detail if the Sellers, before Closing, become aware of a
Material Adverse Change together with a statement (i) on which date the
Sellers became aware of the relevant events, and (ii) whether the Sellers
intend to cure in accordance with Clause 5.1.3(i)(a) or (b), as the case may
be, (the " **Sellers MAC Notice** "). In the Sellers MAC Notice, the Sellers
shall provide the Purchaser with all available documents and other information
allowing the Purchasers to understand the occurrence of a Material Adverse
Change, provided that the level of documentation shall not affect the validity
of the Sellers MAC Notice.

 



 

(iii) In the event that, prior to the Closing, a Material Adverse Change has
occurred in the opinion of the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall notify the
Sellers in writing thereof and shall set forth in sufficient detail the
underlying facts and reasons for this opinion (the " **Purchaser MAC Notice**
"), ** __** provided that the degree of detail shall not affect the validity
of the Purchaser MAC

 



      
 

 



 

Notice. In the Purchaser MAC Notice, the Purchaser shall provide the Sellers
with all documents or information available to them supporting the allegation
that a Material Adverse Change has occurred, provided that the level of
documentation shall not affect the validity of the Purchaser MAC Notice. If
the Sellers do not agree that such facts constitute a Material Adverse Change
and/or wish to cure in accordance with Clause 5.1.3(i)(a) or (b), as the case
may be, they shall within ten Business Days after receipt of the Purchaser MAC
Notice notify the Purchaser in writing of this together with their reasons
(the " **MAC Dispute Notice** "). In the MAC Dispute Notice, the Sellers shall
provide the Purchaser with all available documents and other information
supporting their allegation that a Material Adverse Change has not occurred,
provided that the level of documentation shall not affect the validity of the
MAC Dispute Notice.

 



 

(iv) If (i) the Parties do not reach within ten Business Days after the
receipt of the MAC Dispute Notice an agreement whether a Material Adverse
Change has occurred, or (ii) the Material Adverse Change has not been cured
according to Clauses (a) or (b) above, then this issue shall be resolved by an
arbitration tribunal (the " **Arbitration Tribunal** ") consisting of (a)
Christian Dyckerhoff, BDO Deutsche Warentreuhand AG, as chairman (if he is not
conflicted, which the Parties will clarify within ten Business Days after the
Signing Date), and in case of a conflict or unavailability of Mr. Dyckerhoff
by another senior auditor from an audit firm independent of the Parties to be
jointly agreed by the Parties in good faith within ten Business Days from the
date on which a conflict of Mr. Dyckerhoff becomes apparent, (b) one
arbitrator appointed by the Purchaser but independent of the Purchaser, and
(c) one arbitrator appointed by the Sellers but independent of the Sellers at
the latest within fifteen Business Days after receipt of the MAC Dispute
Notice (the " **Fast Track Arbitration** "). Should Christian Dyckerhoff, BDO
Deutsche Warentreuhand AG, become unavailable or conflicted and the Parties
are unable to agree on an independent chairman within the above period in
spite of good faith efforts, the chairman shall be appointed without undue
delay ( _unverz uglich_) by the German Arbitration Institution (DIS) upon
request of either Party. Should the Sellers or the Purchaser not appoint their
respective arbitrators within the prescribed period, then such arbitrator
shall be appointed by DIS upon request of the respective other Party. The
place of arbitration of the Fast Track Arbitration shall be Frankfurt am Main.

 



 

(v) Either Party shall be allowed to initiate the Fast Track Arbitration by
written notice to the Arbitration Tribunal, once completely appointed, and the
other Parties, enclosing the Purchaser MAC Notice and the MAC Dispute Notice
and specifying that a decision by arbitration thereof is required. The
Arbitration Tribunal, the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent (and their
respective advisors if desired) shall convene (with participation by way of a
video conference being permissible) for an oral hearing not later than ten
Business Days and not earlier than seven Business Days after the arbitrators
have been served with the respective notification as per the first sentence of
this Subclause (v). As evidence the Arbitrational Tribunal shall admit only
such documents and statements of witnesses and expert

 



      
 

 



 

witnesses which the Purchaser and the Sellers Agent make available to the
Arbitration Tribunal and each other at least two Business Days prior to the
hearing (including written witness statements) at such oral hearing; the
Purchaser and the Sellers Agent shall also be entitled to submit, within the
foregoing time limit, briefs in support of their position to the Arbitration
Tribunal; the Arbitration Tribunal shall be entitled to use the services of an
independent auditor if no auditor sits on the panel as chairman. Within ten
Business Days after conclusion of the oral hearing the Arbitrational Tribunal
shall render its decision in writing, provided that in case the Arbitration
Tribunal finds that the Purchaser has submitted a plausible case that a
Material Adverse Change has occurred without having provided full proof of
such Material Adverse Change, then the Arbitration Tribunal shall (a) defer
its decision and (i) give the Purchaser a reasonable period of time of not
less than 25 Business Days, but not more than 40 Business Days to provide
additional proof and (ii) give both Parties the opportunity to submit
additional briefs in support of their positions, (b) set dates for an
additional oral hearing and the final decision of the Arbitration Tribunal.
Sec. 1025 et seq. of the German Civil Procedural Code ( _ZPO_ ) shall apply.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Arbitration Tribunal shall decide solely upon
the question whether a Material Adverse Change has occurred or not.
Irrespective of whether it has been argued as a basis for such occurrence, the
above Arbitration Tribunal shall not decide upon a claim based on breach of
contract (e.g. a breach of the Sellers Guarantees) under this Agreement being
justified or not. Until the Arbitration Tribunal has rendered and served its
decision, the Closing shall be suspended. The costs of the Arbitration
Tribunal shall be borne by such Party loosing the Fast Track Arbitration.

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****Satisfaction of Closing Conditions**

 



 

 **5.2.1** ** **The Purchaser shall notify the competent merger control
authorities in Germany, Russia and Turkey of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement on its own behalf and with respect to any corresponding
notification obligation of the Sellers no later than five Business Days after
the date of this Agreement unless applicable mandatory law or regulations
require an earlier notification.

 



 

Such notification as well as all requests and enquiries from the relevant
merger control authorities which relate to the satisfaction of the Merger
Control Closing Condition shall be dealt with by the Purchaser in consultation
with the Sellers provided, however, that the contents of the notification and
any responses to any such request or enquiry, to the extent relating to the
Group or the Sellers, shall require, if reasonably practicable, prior written
approval by the Sellers which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall promptly and closely co-
operate in preparing the notification and, if reasonably practicable, in any
discussions or negotiations with the relevant merger control authorities and
the Purchaser shall without undue delay ( _unverz uglich_) submit all
necessary information required by the merger control authorities; in respect
of this obligation each Seller shall, in relation to information concerning
the respective Seller or its Affiliates, be obliged as an individual obligor.
If the merger control authorities are prepared to grant their approval only
subject to compliance with specific conditions or obligations to be imposed
upon the Purchaser, the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser shall be obliged to accept the imposition of such conditions and
obligations, unless such imposition would cause undue commercial hardship to
the Purchaser or its Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge that a condition or
obligation causes undue commercial hardship if it implies the divestiture of
any material asset or participation of the Purchasers group or the Group. An
asset or a participation shall be considered material if it is material to
either respective group taken as a whole.

 



 

 **5.2.2** ** **The Purchaser shall apply for a Clearance Certificate pursuant
to and in accordance with sec. 53 para. 3 sentence 1 AWV together with a
request for the acknowledgement of the completeness of the documentation and
the commencement of the two months period referred to in sec. 53 para. 2
sentence 4 AWV no later than five Business Days after the date of this
Agreement. Such application and submission as well as all requests and
enquiries from the German Federal Ministry of Economics which relate to the
satisfaction of the Closing Condition pursuant to Clause 5.1.2 shall without
undue delay be dealt with by the Purchaser in consultation with the Sellers
provided, however, that the contents of any such application and submission
and any responses, to the extent relating to the Group or the Sellers, to any
such request or enquiry shall require, if reasonably practicable, prior
written approval by the Sellers which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall promptly and
closely co-operate in preparing any filings and, if reasonably practicable,
communications to be submitted to, as well as in any discussions or
negotiations with, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and the Purchaser
shall without undue delay ( _unverz uglich_) submit all necessary information
required by the authorities; in respect of this obligation, each Seller shall,
in relation to information concerning the respective Seller or its Affiliates,
be obliged as an individual obligor. If the German Federal Ministry of
Economics is prepared to grant its approval only subject to compliance with
specific conditions or obligations to be imposed upon the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall be obliged to accept the imposition of such conditions and
obligations, unless such imposition would cause undue commercial hardship to
the Purchaser or its Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge that a condition or
obligation causes undue commercial hardship if it implies the divestiture of
any material asset or participation of the Purchasers group or the Group. An
asset or a participation shall be considered material if it is material to
either respective group taken as a whole.

 



 

 **5.2.3** ** **The Purchaser shall give evidence to the Sellers and the
Sellers shall give evidence to the Purchaser of the satisfaction of a Closing
Condition or of the impossibility to satisfy such Closing Condition, in each
case without undue delay ( _unverz uglich_) after becoming aware of the same.

 **6.2** ** ****Release of Securities, Bank Guarantees**

 



 

 **6.2.1** ** **On the Closing Date, the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement (i.e. the Sellers ceasing to control the Target Company) will
constitute a mandatory prepayment-event under the existing debt financing of
the Group Companies described in _Schedule 6.2.1_ (the " **Existing Financial
Indebtedness** "). As a consequence, upon such change of control, all
facilities under the Existing Financial Indebtedness will be cancelled and all
outstanding amounts shall be immediately due and payable. In relation to the
guarantees and letters of credit issued under such debt financing for the
Group Companies and outstanding on the Closing Date, the change of control
requires the immediate provision of cash cover and/or the issuance of back-to
back bank guarantees in accordance with the requirements set out in the
underlying credit documentation. The same applies in case of a voluntary
cancellation / prepayment.

 



 

 **6.2.2** ** **Subject to the simultaneous release of security as set out in
Clauses 6.2.4 and 6.2.5, the Purchaser shall therefore make available or cause
to be made available on the Closing Date the relevant funds required for the
(voluntary) repayment or prepayment of the Existing Financial Indebtedness,
including such funds required to provide cash cover, and/or issue back-to-back
bank guarantees in relation to the outstanding guarantees and letters of
credit, but excluding any amounts resulting from cancellation or prepayment
penalties or similar costs and expenses (the " **Prepayment Penalties** "),
which will be borne and made available by the Sellers (or, if agreed by the
Purchaser, paid by the Purchaser for the Sellers by payment of a corresponding
portion of the Purchase Price to the Existing Lenders through the Agent). If
and to the extent that Coperion GmbH in the reasonable judgment of the
management of the Group  without resorting to the funds of the other Group
Companies and taking into account the operative needs of the Group  is able
to make available funds to repay the Working Capital Pay-Off Amount and the
Hedging Costs (both as defined below), it is agreed between the Parties, that
Coperion GmbH shall provide such funds upon request by the Purchaser.

 



 

The payment of such funds shall in each case be made by or on behalf of the
relevant Group Companies to the agent and security agent of the finance
parties (the " **Agent** " and " **Security Agent** ") for distribution to the
relevant banks of the relevant Group Companies (the " **Existing Lenders** ")
in compliance with a flow of

 



      
 

 



 

funds statement agreed between the Parties prior to the Scheduled Closing Date
(the " **Flow of Funds Statement** ") ** _._**

 



 

The Prepayment Penalties shall not include any costs and expenses resulting
from the cancellation of the interest hedging incurred by the Group Companies
(the " **Hedging Costs** "); such cancellation shall be effected
simultaneously with the cancellation of the Existing Financial Indebtedness,
whereby the respective costs and expenses shall be borne by the Group
Companies and not the Sellers. The Sellers shall procure that the respective
costs and expenses will be paid when due.

 



 

 **6.2.3** ** **The Sellers shall

 



 

(i) procure that the Agent provides the Target Company and the Purchaser at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, at the latest, with a
statement (the " **Pay-off Declaration** ") setting forth:

 



 

(a) the aggregate amount of such part of the Existing Financial Indebtedness
remaining outstanding as of the Closing Date, which had been used by the
Target Company for the acquisition of Coperion Group in 2007, plus any accrued
and unpaid interest, fees and costs and any Prepayment Penalties until and
including the Closing Date under or in connection with the Existing Financial
Indebtedness (the " **Acquisition Pay-off Amount** "), and

 



 

(b) the aggregate amount of any other part of the Existing Financial
Indebtedness remaining outstanding as of the Closing Date, plus any accrued
and unpaid interest, cash cover amounts, fees and costs and any Prepayment
Penalties until and including the Closing Date under or in connection with the
Existing Financial Indebtedness (the " **Working Capital Pay-off Amount** ",
and together with the Acquisition Pay-off Amount, the " **Total** **Pay-off
Amount** "), and

 



 

(c) the amount and number of back-to-back guarantees to be provided as an
alternative to any cash cover for existing letters of credit (this however
contingent upon the Purchaser having provided sufficient information to the
Agent and the Existing Lenders about the banks issuing such back-to-back
guarantees so that the Existing Lenders will confirm that said guarantees are
acceptable to them)

 



 

owing and payable or (in the case of back-to-back guarantees) to be submitted
to the Agent and the Existing Lenders;

 



 

(ii) procure that the Target Company shall provide the Agent with the notice
of voluntary cancellation / prepayment in relation to the Existing Financial
Indebtedness, upon instruction of the Purchaser, at least seven Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, that such notice shall be issued. In case the
Purchaser fails to (p)repay the Existing Financial Indebtedness on the day
specified in such notice, including the provision of cash cover or back to
back guarantees, due to a breach of its contractual obligations under this
Agreement, it shall indemnify the Sellers and the relevant Group Companies in
accordance with applicable law.

 



 

(iii) the details of the account into which the funds required to prepay
and/or repay the Existing Financial Indebtedness shall be paid.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.2.4** ** **The Sellers shall  however, subject to Clauses 6.2.5 and
6.2.6  procure that the Existing Lenders and the Security Agent release the
existing security granted to them over any shares in the Group Companies and
over any other assets (including, but not limited to, the Group Companies
security interests which are listed in _Schedule 6.2.1_ (the " **Group
Companies  Securities**"), and reassigns and / or retransfers, if applicable,
such assets to the respective Group Companies as security grantors, with
effect as of Closing but upon the condition precedent ( _aufschiebende
Bedingung_ ) that the Agent has irrevocably and unconditionally received the
Total Pay-Off Amount, by presenting executed release agreements between the
relevant Existing Lenders, the Security Agent, the Target Company and the
respective Group Companies or other appropriate release and/or reassignment or
retransfer instruments reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser (the " **Release
Agreements** "). Pending such release, the Sellers shall indemnify the Group
Companies from any amounts payable in respect of the Group Companies
Securities.

 



 

 **6.2.5** ** **With respect to the land charges granted in favour of the
Existing Lenders / the Security Agent it is the understanding of the Parties
that for fulfilment of the security release as set out in Clause 6.2.4, the
filing of a cancellation notice ( _L oschungsbewilligung_) together with a
notarial statement ( _Notarbest atigung_) that there are no obstacles in
relation to the registration in the land register ( _Grundbuch_ ) will be
sufficient.

 



 

 **6.2.6** ** **The Sellers shall further use reasonable best efforts that the
Group Companies, the Existing Lenders and/or the Security Agent make the
relevant declaratory notifications, filings and registrations in relation to
the release of the above-mentioned security interests without undue delay.

 



 

 **6.2.7** ** **To the extent the release mechanism under this Clause 6.2
requires further amendments after the Signing Date following from the outcome
of the discussions with the Existing Lenders, the Parties shall duly cooperate
and take all appropriate measures to effect a release of the Group Companies
Securities in due course in connection with the Closing.

 



 

 **6.3** ** ****Vendor Loan**

 



 

 **6.3.1** ** **The Vendor Loan as referred to in _Recital (D)_ shall be
carved out as follows:

 



 

Prior to the Closing Date the Vendor Loan will be sold and transferred  both
contingent however upon the reassignment of the Vendor Loan effective as of
the release of all security granted under the Existing Financial Indebtedness
or upon the consent of the Existing Lenders  to the Sellers against a total
consideration of EUR 16,300,000 (plus interest accrued thereon until
effectiveness of the sale); the consideration is in the following referred to
as the vendor loan purchase price receivable (the " **Vendor Loan PPR** ").

 



 

 **6.3.2** ** **If the transfer of the Vendor Loan cannot be effected due to
the fact that Bricol  as the contractual partner of the Group and the owner
of the real estate to which the Vendor Loan relates  does not consent to the
respective transfer, the Sellers shall become the beneficial owner of the
Vendor Loan and Coperion GmbH shall act as legal owner and trustee for the
Sellers ( _treuh anderisches Halten des Vendor Loans durch Coperion GmbH fur
die Verkaufer_). Apart from this, if and to the extent the sale and transfer
provided in this Clause 6.3.2 cannot validly be effected (including

 



      
 

 



 

but not limited to the missing consent by Bricol), the Parties will undertake
all measures so to put Sellers, Purchaser, Coperion GmbH and the Target
Company economically into a position that would as close as possible come to a
situation that would have existed if the sale and transfer of the Vendor Loan
had been valid.

 



 

 **6.3.3** ** **Prior to the Closing Date, the Target Company will by way of a
shareholders resolution resolve on the distribution at the level of Coperion
GmbH of an amount equalling to the amount of the Vendor Loan PPR, whereby the
respective resolution will also provide for the conversion of the payment
claim resulting from the distribution into a loan from the Target Company to
Coperion GmbH and the possibility that the claim of the Target Company
resulting from the loan may also be satisfied by way of a transfer in kind of
the Vendor Loan PPR.

 



 

 **6.3.4** ** **For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes of the Target Company or
Coperion GmbH resulting from the transactions set out in Clause 6.3 or 12.1
shall be borne by the Sellers in the form of a separate indemnity, whereby no
loss carry forward available at the level of Coperion GmbH as per Closing Date
may be used or credited to the Sellers in connection therewith, and if any
such loss carry forward is so used, the Sellers shall fully indemnify the
Purchaser for such use, whereby for the avoidance of doubt, any losses carry
forward available at the level of the Target Company may be fully used in
connection with the transactions set out in Clause 6.3 or 12.1.

 



 

 **6.3.5** ** **In addition, and only for purposes of the steps in Clauses 6.3
or 12.1, the Sellers warrant in the form of an independent promise of warranty
( _selbst andiges Garantieversprechen_) pursuant to sec. 311 German Civil Code
( _BGB_ ) that as of the Signing Date and as of the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) the Target Company has sufficient distributable equity on its statutory
commercial balance sheet to make the distribution set out in Clause 12.1; and

 



 

(ii) Coperion GmbH has sufficient distributable equity on its statutory
commercial balance sheet to make the distribution set out in Clause 6.3.

 



 

In the event of a breach of a the warranty pursuant to this Clause 6.3, the
Sellers shall be obliged to compensate the Purchaser or, upon the Purchasers
written Notice the Target Company and/or Coperion GmbH, by way of monetary
damages ( _Schadensersatz in Geld_ ) in an amount equal to the damage suffered
by the Purchaser or the Target Company and/or Coperion GmbH in connection with
the breach; the obligations of the Sellers to compensate the Purchaser shall
include indirect damages and consequential damages, but shall exclude lost
profits ( _entgangener Gewinn_ ).

 



 

 **6.3.6** ** **Sellers and Purchaser shall procure that Coperion GmbH and
Target Company duly issue certificates according to Sec. 27 para 3 German
Corporate Income Tax Act, if and insofar the distributions set out in Clause
6.3 and 12.1 could be funded out of the tax contribution account (
_steuerliches Einlagekonto_ ). The provisions of Clauses 11.4, 11.5.3 and the
limitations pursuant to Clause 10.6.3 shall apply accordingly with regard to
any claims under this Clause 6.3. The other limitations in Clauses 10 and 11
shall not apply.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.4** ** ****Coperion Real Estate Verwaltungs GmbH and Coperion Real Estate
GmbH and Co. KG**

 



 

 **6.4.1** ** **The Sellers shall ensure that the term "Coperion" shall be
deleted from the firm name of Coperion Real Estate Verwaltungs GmbH prior to
the Closing. The Sellers confirm that none of them and none of their
Affiliates or Related Persons (other than the Group Companies) has any rights
with respect to the term or name "Coperion".

 



 

 **6.4.2** ** **The Sellers shall ensure that Coperion GmbH shall withdraw
from Coperion Real Estate GmbH and Co. KG prior to the Closing Date without any
receivables, liabilities or obligations for Coperion GmbH, and the Sellers
shall indemnify and hold harmless Coperion GmbH from any and all obligations
and liabilities which it may have now or in the future in connection with its
current partnership interest ( _Kommanditbeteiligung_ ) in Coperion Real
Estate GmbH and Co. KG or any actions or omissions in that connection. Sellers
confirm that as of the Signing Date and as of the Closing Date, Coperion Real
Estate GmbH and Co. KG has no assets.

the Purchaser on the other hand may, prior to the fulfilment or waiver of all
Closing Conditions, withdraw from this Agreement ( _R ucktritt_) with

periods if needed. If no withdrawal right according to this Clause 7.1.3 is
exercised within the prescribed periods, the Closing shall occur in accordance
with this Agreement.

other side may withdraw from this Agreement by written notice to the
respective other Parties, unless the non-performance of any Closing Action is
within the control of the Party stating the withdrawal and/or such Party is
otherwise in breach of this Agreement, and provided that the withdrawal shall
be deemed void and shall not have any effect, if at the time when the notice
is received by the respective other Parties all Closing Actions have been
performed or waived. As long as the Sellers and the Purchaser have a dispute
as to whether a Material Adverse Change has occurred, the right of withdrawal

 **8.2** ** ****Closing Actions**

 



 

At Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall take the following actions
(the " **Closing Actions** ") simultaneously ( _Zug um Zug_ ):

 



 

 **8.2.1** ** **Execution of the escrow agreement as provided in Clause 4.3
unless such escrow agreement has been executed prior to Closing.

 



 

 **8.2.2** ** **The Purchaser shall pay the Share Purchase Price plus Regular

the Closing and shall not prejudice any claims the Sellers or, respectively,
the Purchaser, may have on the basis of any circumstances relating to the non-
performance of such Closing Action.

 



 

By way of signing appropriate closing minutes, substantially as attached as

other manner the rights of the Purchaser or the Sellers under or in connection
with this Agreement.

 



 

The Parties shall notify the acting notary of the completion of the Closing by
forwarding a copy of the signed closing minutes to him. In accordance with
Sec. 40 para. 2 Act on limited liability companies ( _GmbHG_ ), the notary

jurisdictions by the Group Companies. The Sellers Guarantee contained in this
Clause 9.14 shall not apply to any laws relating to IP Rights, environmental

Officers and employees and, to the Sellers Knowledge, the Groups independent

the foregoing acts described in subclauses (i), (ii) and (iv) above involved
benefits or gratuities of less than EUR 1,000 in a single case or related
cases, such act shall be disregarded for purposes of this warranty. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that this EUR 1,000 de minimis provision
and each materiality qualification in this Clause 9.14 shall in no way be
deemed to imply or indicate that the policies of the Group condone or
otherwise accept any kind of illegal behaviour whatsoever.

 



 

As of the Signing Date, none of the Group Companies since 2003 sold or

covered by an insurance of any Group Company, the Purchaser or any of the

contract ( _o ffentlich-rechtlicher Vertrag_) based on Environmental Laws,
which was existing and applicable to the Business as of Closing or which was

withheld, delayed or conditioned; or

 



 

(b) a remediation in whatever form by the Purchaser or the relevant Group

measures or notifications to authorities after the Closing Date unless they

the Purchaser and/or the Group Companies, such conduct would expose the
Purchaser or the relevant Group Company to additional liability under
Environmental Laws.

 



 

(iii) Any claims of the Purchaser for damages pursuant to Sec. 24 (2) Federal
Soil Protection Act ( _Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz_ ) and/or Sec. 9 (2)
Environmental Damages Act ( _Umweltschadensgesetz_ ) against the Sellers, any
of Sellers Affiliates or any of its or their respective legal predecessors

other jurisdictions shall be excluded.

million of damages. The second million Euro of damages shall be fully borne by
Sellers. Any amount exceeding two million Euro of damages up to the cap set
forth in Clause 10.5.2 shall be borne by the Sellers and the Purchaser in

Escrow Amount the Purchaser may claim against all Sellers irrespective of such
allocation.

 **10.8** ** ****Indemnification regarding Horstmann Litigation**

 



 

 **10.8.1** ** **Coperion GmbH  together with Atlas-Vermogensverwaltungs-GmbH
and ThyssenKrupp Technologies Beteiligungen GmbH  is the co-defendant in a
litigation initiated by Jurgen Horstmann (the " **Horstmann Litigation** ") in
relation to an acquisition of certain companies and shares from ThyssenKrupp
Group and other sellers in 1996 (Az. 41 O 114/98). The amount in dispute (
_Streitwert_ ) amounts to EUR 10,296,250; in addition to such amount, interest
has been claimed by the plaintiff and other costs ( _inter alia_ court and
attorney fees) will be triggered. In the first instance, the District Court of
Essen ( _Landgericht Essen_ ), by decision dated 1 September 2010, dismissed
the action. The appeal by the plaintiff is currently pending with the Higher
Regional Court of Hamm. In a framework agreement dated

 



      
 

 



 

12 October 2000, by which ThyssenKrupp Group among others sold its interest in
Krupp Werner Pfleiderer GmbH  the legal predecessor of Coperion GmbH , Krupp
Werner Pfleiderer GmbH was indemnified by Thyssen Krupp Industries AG from and
against all risks in connection with the Horstmann Litigation (the "
**ThyssenKrupp Indemnification** "). In a letter to Coperion GmbH dated 8
October 2012, ThyssenKrupp AG referred to the document containing said
indemnification.

 



 

 **10.8.2** ** **The Sellers hereby indemnify Coperion GmbH from and against
all risks resulting from the Horstmann Litigation. Such indemnification shall
however be triggered only if the indemnification granted by ThyssenKrupp
Technologies AG should be held invalid by a final and non-appealable judgement
of a competent court for whatever reason, e.g. for termination by mutual
agreement, for rescission for error or fraud etc.. The indemnification by the
Sellers according to this Clause 10.8.2 shall be limited to a maximum amount
of EUR 7,000,000; this limitation shall be separate and independent and in
addition to the limitation in Clause 10.5.2, solely for purpose of the
indemnity in this Clause 10.8. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holdback shall
not be available to the Purchaser for purposes of enforcing any claims under
this Clause 10.8.

 



 

 **10.8.3** ** **The indemnification by Sellers according to Clause 10.8.2
shall cease to exist with immediate effect upon provision of a confirmatory
statement by ThyssenKrupp Group in a legally binding manner that ThyssenKrupp
Technologies Beteiligungen GmbH (previously ThyssenKrupp Technologies AG, and
prior to that ThyssenKrupp Industries AG) is still bound by the ThyssenKrupp
Indemnification. It is agreed between the Parties that a confirmation attached
as _Schedule 10.8.3_ (also if sent as pdf file or telefax) would fulfil such
requisite.

 



 

 **10.8.4** ** **Any indemnification claims by the Purchaser under Clause
10.8.2 shall become time-barred by 31 December, 2017.

 



 

 **11** ** ****Tax Matters**

 



 

 **11.1** ** ****Tax Indemnity**

 



 

 **11.1.1** ** **The Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser or, in the
Purchasers discretion, the relevant Group Company from and against any Pre-
Closing Date Taxes due and payable by any of the Group Companies, which are or
will be finally and bindingly assessed ( _materiell bestandskr aftig
__festgesetzt_ ), but only if and to the extent, that the specific Tax giving
rise to such an indemnification

 



 

(i) has not been paid or set-off prior to the Closing Date,

 



 

(ii) cannot be recovered by a claim for repayment, reimbursement or
indemnification against a party other than a Group Company, provided that this
exception shall only apply to the extent that recovery has been sought in
comparable situations in past practice of the relevant Group Company, further
provided that to the extent that a court or arbitration case for recovery with
a third party is lost in the first instance to that extent the claim shall not
be deemed recoverable, and further provided that the Sellers shall bear
reasonable costs of the recovery attempts and processes (subject to the prior
consent of the Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned),

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) has not been accrued in the Closing Date Management Accounts (a)
specifically for the relevant Group Company (no further specificity required)
but not to the extent that such specific accruals have already been used
pursuant to the following 11.1.1(iii)(b), or (b) up to an aggregate amount of
EUR 2,000,000 for all cases of Tax indemnity for other Group Companies but not
to the extent already used pursuant to 11.1.1(iii)(a) (permitted netting),

 



 

(iv) cannot or could not be avoided by offsetting Taxable profits against any
Tax losses carry back or Tax losses carry forward that are or were available
(including as a result of subsequent Tax audits) in the Pre-Closing Date
Period __ (other than the losses carry back or carry forward described in
_Schedule 11.1.1(iv)_ as adjusted following a utilisation of Tax losses carry
forward taken into consideration in connection with the establishment of the
Closing Date Management Accounts, to the extent they exceed the amount of EUR
15 million), whereby any consumption, reduction or forfeiture of such Tax loss
carry back or loss carry forward (other than the losses carry back or carry
forward described in _Schedule 11.1.1(iv)_ as adjusted following a
utilisation of Tax losses carry forward taken into consideration in connection
with the establishment of the Closing Date Management Accounts, to the extent
they exceed the amount of EUR 15 million) caused directly or indirectly by the
Purchaser or  after the Closing Date  by any of the Group Companies shall be
taken into account for the purpose of the existence of such offsetting
opportunity,

 



 

(v) does not correspond to or cannot be offset against any Tax Benefit which
can also arise at a different type of Tax and which is based on a circumstance
having triggered the Tax indemnification claim, including, but not limited to
reciprocal effects ( _Wechselwirkungen_ ) resulting e.g. from the lengthening
of depreciation periods or higher depreciation allowances (
_Phasenverschiebung_ ) or from transfer of items relevant for Taxes (e.g.
turnover, income, expenses, value added tax payable corresponding with a value
added tax refund etc.) into another calendar year or transfer of Tax items
from one entity of the Group to another entity of the Group, whereby future
Tax Benefits after the Closing Date shall be calculated at their net present
value discounted at a rate of 3% p.a., calculated on a stand alone basis and
applying a notional tax rate of 15% without taking into account the actual tax
situation of the respective Group Company, and provided that any such benefits
shall only be taken into account if they will be realized within seven years
from the Closing Date.

 



 

(vi) with respect to Pre-Closing Date Taxes does not arise or is increased as
a result of the failure or omission of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing Date, the Group Companies) to make any valid
claim, election, surrender, disclaimer, to give any valid notice, consent or
to do anything else under the provisions of any enactment or regulation
relating to Tax after the Closing Date, the making, giving or doing of which
was taken into account in computing the provisions for Tax in the Annual
Accounts or the Closing Date Management Accounts,

 



 

(vii) is not directly or indirectly caused by a reorganisation or other
measures initiated or executed by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Date, the Group Companies), or their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives, including but not
limited to a change of methods of Tax accounting not consistent with the
established practice of the relevant Group Company prior to the Closing Date
or causing any Group Company to amend any Tax returns, unless, in each case,
required to be compliant with applicable laws, administrative principles or
relevant court decisions, including with respect to transfer pricing and

 



 

(viii) does not result from any changes in law entered or entering into force
after the Closing Date including any such changes case law provided for by the
highest financial courts in the relevant jurisdiction, unless the relevant
Group Company benefits from or applies grandfathering rules provided by the
respective Tax Authorities or by law in this respect, and applied with
retroactive effect prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

 **11.1.2** ** **Closing Date Management Accounts

 



 

(i) The term " **Closing Date Management Accounts** " shall mean (i) the
internal and unaudited consolidated management accounts of all Group Companies
as of the Closing Date, if the Closing Date is the last day of the month but
not the last day of the financial year of the Company, or, if the Closing Date
is not the last day of a month, the last day of the month immediately
preceding the Closing Date, or (ii) the audited consolidated annual financial
statements of the Group if the Closing Date is the last day of the financial
year of the Company. The Parties agree that the Closing Date Management
Accounts (i) shall be prepared by the Group within ten Business Days after the
Closing Date (a) consistently applying the accounting procedures established
with the Group as in previous periods, unless otherwise required, (b)
consistently applying the accounting principles used to prepare management
accounts for prior periods, unless otherwise required, and (ii) shall provide
accruals for Taxes in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise
required) and applicable law, provided that the Closing Date Management
Accounts shall not contain accruals for additional Taxes resulting from the
pending Tax audits for Tax periods until 2008, however including a reasonable
calculation in accordance with past practice for specific accruals for taxes
attributable to the period between the date of the Closing Date Management
Accounts and the Closing Date, if Closing Date occurs after the date of the
Closing Date Management Accounts.

 



 

(ii) If the Sellers or the Purchaser do not agree with the Closing Management
Accounts provided by the Group, the Sellers and/or Purchaser shall forward to
the respective other Party, within a period of thirty Business Days following
the provision of the Closing Management Accounts by the Group to the Sellers
and the Purchaser, in writing a dispute notice specifying the items in the
Closing Date Managements Accounts, which are in dispute. If no agreement can
be reached between the Parties on these items within a further period of ten
Business Days, each Party  within a period of one month upon the expiration
of said ten Business Period period  may forward the items in dispute to
arbitration in accordance with Clause 16.6.

 



      
 

 



 

 **11.1.3** ** **Indemnity Payments

 



 

(i) Payments by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this Clause 11.1
shall be due 20 (twenty) Business Days after the respective Seller has been
notified in writing by the Purchaser about the payment obligation or the
upcoming payment and the corresponding payment date and has received a copy of
the underlying Tax return, assessment or payment order, but in no case earlier
than five Business Days prior to the date at which the underlying Tax is due
and payable or will be paid to the Tax Authority.

 



 

(ii) If a Tax case is still open, but the Tax payment has to be made by any
Group Company before the Tax assessment has become finally binding ( _formell
und materiell bestandskr aftig_), the Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser on
the same basis as set forth in this Clause 11. The relevant indemnification
payments of the Sellers shall be treated as advance indemnification payments
to the Purchaser. If a lower Tax than already indemnified is subsequently
assessed, the difference shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser or the relevant
Group Companies to the Sellers not later than ten Business Days after the
difference has been finally refunded to the relevant Group Companies by the
Tax Authorities (including by way of set-off against other Taxes). The
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the respective Group Company will,
notify the Seller in writing without undue delay about such lower Tax
assessment. If a higher Tax than already indemnified is subsequently assessed,
the difference shall be reimbursed by the Sellers in accordance with the
provisions of this Clause 11. The Sellers shall be entitled to have, at the
Sellers own expense, a certified accounting firm review whether the Purchaser
has fully complied with its notification obligation.

 



 

(iii) The Sellers shall make any payments to the Purchaser.

 



 

(iv) Upon request of the Sellers the Purchaser shall procure that, in line
with past practice of the Sellers, the respective Group Company uses all
efforts to achieve a deferred payment date, in particular but not limited to
the application for a suspension of enforcement of Tax payment obligation (
_Aussetzung der Vollziehung_ ) or equivalent application in foreign
jurisdictions. Any interest payment imposed on any Group Company and resulting
from or accruing in connection with the deferred payment shall be borne by the
Sellers.

 



 

(v) If the Tax for which an indemnification payment has been made is
subsequently reduced within seven (7) years from the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall be obliged to reimburse the Sellers for the difference between
the higher indemnification payment and the lower Tax amount, including all
interests related thereto as finally and bindingly assessed by the Tax
Authorities provided however, that Clause 11.1.3(ii) shall apply accordingly.
The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies will, notify
the Sellers in writing without undue delay about a subsequent reduction of
Taxes together with all relevant material underlying documents and
information.

 



      
 

 



 

 **11.2** ** ****Tax Refunds**

 



 

 **11.2.1** ** **The Purchaser shall be obliged to reimburse the Sellers any
Tax Refund actually received or realised by the Group Companies. A Tax Refund
shall be deemed received or realised by a Group Company upon, as applicable,

 



 

(i) the receipt of actual payment from a Tax Authority; or

 



 

(ii) the declaration of set-off with Tax liabilities actually owed to a Tax
Authority.

 



 

 **11.2.2** ** **The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group
Companies will, notify the Sellers in writing without undue delay of the
receipt of any Tax Refund together with all material underlying documents and
information.

Clause 11.2 shall be due twenty Business Days after receipt or realisation of
the relevant Tax Refund pursuant to Clause 11.2.1 above.

 



 

 **11.2.4** ** **Clause 11.1.1(v) shall apply to Tax Refunds mutatis mutandis.

 **11.3.1** ** **The Sellers guarantee by way of an independent promise of
warranty ( _selbst andiges Garantieversprechen_) pursuant to sec. 311 German
Civil Code ( _BGB_ ), and exclusively with the remedies pursuant to Clause
11.3.2 which form an integral part and define the scope of this promise of
warranty, that the statements set forth in this Clause _ 11.3.1_ (the "
**Sellers  Tax Warranties**") are true and correct for the period until the
Closing Date.

 



 

(i) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 11.3.1(i),_ no Group Company is
currently subject to any audit, examination or similar proceedings by any Tax
authorities, or an appeal against any tax assessment or any proceeding in any
Tax court.

 



 

(ii) The books and other records of each Group Company relating to Taxes,
including documentation for transfer pricing purposes, have been prepared to
the best of Sellers knowledge to the extent actually and legally required and
are available for inspection at the premises of the relevant Group Company.

 



 

 **11.3.2** ** **In the event of a breach of a Sellers Tax Warranty pursuant
to Clause 11.3.1, Clause 10.3 shall apply accordingly. Such obligation shall
include in particular any costs, fines or penalties for any delay ( _S aumnis
 oder Verspatungszuschlage_) that results from a breach of the respective
Sellers Tax Warranty. Sellers and Purchaser shall bear the costs, including
advisors fees, of establishing proper transfer pricing documentation in
accordance with all applicable laws, in equal parts (50/50), Sellers, however,
only up to an amount of EUR 50,000 in total; in addition, Sellers shall bear
any penalties for late submission of such documentation.

due diligence and final Tax review by the Purchaser, the Parties will use best
reasonable efforts to

for the fiscal years until and including the fiscal year in which Closing
occurs.

 



 

 **11.4.2** ** **The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of any announcement
and commencement of any Relevant Tax Proceeding. The notification shall be
made in writing and without undue delay after the Purchaser or the relevant
Group Company became aware of such event and shall contain full factual
information describing the object of the Relevant Tax Proceeding in reasonable
detail and shall include copies of any assessment, notice or other document
received from any Tax Authority related to the respective Tax.

 



 

 **11.4.3** ** **The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant
Group Company shall, (i) give the Sellers the opportunity to participate at
their own cost and expense from the beginning on in all Relevant Tax
Proceedings, (ii) upon Sellers request and at their own cost and expense,

reasonable instructions given by Sellers in relation to the conduct of the Tax
Proceedings referred to in (i) or (ii) above which has duly taken the
reasonable interests ( _berechtigten Interessen_ ) of the Group into
consideration. In any case the Purchaser shall procure that after the Closing
Date no Relevant Tax Proceeding is settled or becomes time-barred without the
prior written consent of the Sellers which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

 



 

 **11.4.4** ** **The Purchaser shall fully cooperate, and shall cause the
Group Companies and their representatives to fully cooperate, with the Sellers
with respect to all Relevant Tax Proceedings. The Purchaser shall in
particular procure that the Sellers obtain any document or information which

 **11.5.1** ** **Claims of the Purchaser under this Clause 11 shall not be
subject to the limitations set forth in Clause 10 unless expressly set forth
in this Clause 11.5.1. The total liability of the Sellers under this Clause 11
shall  together with any other liabilities for Breaches under this Agreement
 not exceed the aggregate maximum amount set forth in Clause 10.5.2, first

minutes and with effect after the assignment of the Shares, at the latest
however one Business Day after the execution of the closing minutes, the
following steps shall be implemented with respect to the Vendor Loan PPR
referred to in Clause 6.3:

 



 

 **12.1.1** ** **First, in fulfilment of the obligation following from the
shareholders resolution under Clause 6.3.3, the Vendor Loan PPR shall be
transferred by Coperion GmbH to the Target Company by way of a distribution in
kind. As a consequence, the Target Company will become the owner of the Vendor
Loan PPR.

 



 

 **12.1.2** ** **Second, the Vendor Loan PPR shall be transferred by the
Target Company to the Purchaser by way of a distribution in kind. As a
consequence, the Purchaser will become the owner of the Vendor Loan PPR.

 



 

 **12.1.3** ** **Third, in fulfilment of its obligation under Clause 3.1.2,
the Purchaser shall transfer the Vendor Loan PPR to the Sellers as set out in
Clause 6.3. As a consequence, the Vendor Loan PPR will expire as a result of a
confusion of rights and obligations.

 



 

 **12.1.4** ** **If and to the extent the measures provided in this Clause
12.1 cannot validly be effected, the Parties will undertake all measures so to
put the Parties economically into a position that would as close as possible

Vendor Loan PPR had been valid.

 

 ** **

 

 **12.2** ** ****Information and Documents**

 



 

For a period of five years after Closing Date, each Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access at the respective Sellers
expense to copies of the books and records of the Group with respect to

reasonably be required by the respective Seller in connection with a potential
claim or liability of such seller. The Purchaser shall afford such access upon
receipt of reasonable written advance notice and during normal business hours.
The Purchaser shall keep, and procure that the Group Companies will keep, all

its Affiliates or any of the directors, employees, advisors or other
representatives of the foregoing parties (collectively referred to as "
**Beneficiaries** "), the Purchaser shall to the extent legally permissible
cause the respective Group Companies to waive such claims against the
Beneficiaries, except to the extent that (i)  in case any of the Sellers is
held liable  the Purchaser has the right to be indemnified from such
liability or obligation by the relevant Seller under the terms of this
Agreement, or (ii) the claim is based on fraudulent or intentional acts, or
(iii) such claim relates to (y) the service or employment relationship between
any Group Company and any of the Sellers 6  8, or (z) the office of any of
such Sellers as managing directors or other board members of any Group
Company.

 



 

 **12.4** ** ****Discharge of Members of Corporate Bodies**

 



 

To the extent that members of corporate bodies of the Group Companies, who
will resign from office with effect as from Closing as set out in Clause
8.2.4, have not been granted full discharge ( _Entlastung_ ) prior to Closing
for the period up to Closing, the Purchaser undertakes by way of an agreement
for the benefit of third parties ( _Vertrag zugunsten Dritter_ ) and to the
extent legally permissible, to procure that (i) on the Closing Date or without
undue delay ( _unverz uglich_) thereafter all resolutions are passed and all
declarations are made which are required to grant full discharge (
_Entlastung_ ) to the relevant members for the period up to Closing and (ii)
neither the Shares nor the shares and partnership interests in any of the
Subsidiaries are resold and/or transferred prior to the Purchaser having fully
complied with the obligations pursuant to (i). The right of the Sellers and
the Group Companies to procure such discharge prior to Closing shall remain
unaffected.

where such competing activity does not form part of the core business of such
enterprise.

 



 

 **12.6** ** ****Transition of Business**

 



 

The Parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other such
assistance and information which is reasonably necessary in connection with
this Agreement and the implementation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. After the Closing Date the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cooperate to provide for a smooth transition of the Group Companies to the
Purchaser.

 



 

 **12.7** ** ****No Agreements with and Claims of Sellers and Affiliates**

and Related Persons will not have any claims of any nature against any of the
Group

 



      
 

 



 

Companies except for the claims listed in _Schedule 12.7_ ; as a matter of
precaution the Sellers hereby waive any such claims, will cause their
respective Affiliates to waive any such claims and will indemnify and hold
harmless the group Companies against any such claims.

 **13.1** ** ****Public Announcements**

 



 

No press or other public announcement in connection with the existence or the
subject matter of this Agreement shall be made or issued by or on behalf of

not disclose or use any information received or obtained as a result of, or in
connection with, the entering into this Agreement which relates to this

Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, procures compliance of the
relevant Group Company or statutory representative with the confidentiality
obligations set out in this Clause 13.2 in respect of such information as if
it were a party to this Agreement,

 



 

(v) the information is or becomes publicly available (other than by breach of
this Agreement or any other confidentiality agreement between the Parties or
any of them),

 



 

(vi) the Sellers in case of a disclosure or use by the Purchaser or the
Guarantor, or the Purchaser in case of a disclosure or use by the Sellers, has
given prior written approval to the disclosure or use, or

 



 

(vii) the information is independently developed after Closing.

 



 

 **14** ** ****Guarantor s Undertaking**

 



 

The Guarantor hereby guarantees to the Sellers by way of an independent and
non-accessory guarantee pursuant to sec. 311 German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ) _(_
_nicht-akzessorische Garantie_ _)_ the full and punctual performance of all
obligations and undertakings of the Purchaser under this Agreement, including
implied obligations under this Agreement, in the manner provided for in this
Agreement. This guarantee shall be subject to all defences and remedies of the
Purchaser under this Agreement. The Guarantors defence of failure to pursue
remedies ( _Einrede der Vorausklage_ ) shall be excluded.

 



 

 **15** ** ****No Liability of Sellers  Representatives**

 



 

The Purchaser and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that none of the
directors, employees, advisors and/or other representatives of the Sellers
(collectively " **Sellers  Representatives**"), shall have any liability or
obligation towards the Purchaser or the Guarantor, arising out of, connected
with or resulting from the activities or any of the foregoing as advisor to,
or any other representative of, the Sellers in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and implementation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (including but not limited to any
information or advice given or supplied by the Sellers Representatives)
unless (i) expressly agreed otherwise in writing between any of the foregoing
representatives of the Sellers and the Purchaser or, as the case may be, the
Guarantor, or (ii) the claim of the Purchaser is based on fraudulent or
intentional acts of the respective Sellers representative.

 



 

 **16** ** ****Miscellaneous Provisions**

 



 

 **16.1** ** ****Sellers Agent**

 



 

In making amendments, consents, waivers, statements, declarations or notices
under or in connection with this agreement, the Sellers shall solely act
through Deutsche Beteiligungs AG, Borsenstraße 1, 60313 Frankfurt am Main, as
the selected representative hereby jointly appointed by the Sellers (the "
**Sellers  Agent**"). Any amendments, consents,

 



      
 

 



 

waivers, statements, declarations or notices of the Sellers under or in
connection with this Agreement shall therefore be validly made only if made by
the Sellers Agent on behalf of all Sellers jointly and in a uniform manner.
The Sellers hereby irrevocably authorize and empower the Sellers Agent to act
in their name and on their behalf (exempted from the restrictions of Section
181 BGB) in making any and all such amendments, consents, waivers, statements,
declarations and notices and to execute all transactions or documents they may
deem appropriate to implement this Agreement. The Sellers Agent shall have
the right to ask for internal Sellers approval prior to any action taken, but
the Purchaser may rely on any act or omission of the Sellers Agent
irrespective of any such internal inquiry. The foregoing shall also apply to
the receiving of any amendments, consents, waivers, statements, declarations
or notices as well as to the exercise of any rights by the Sellers under or in
connection with this Agreement. The authorization and power of attorney of the
Sellers Agent can only be terminated and shall be deemed to continue until
the Sellers have either through the Sellers Agent or otherwise jointly
communicated in writing to the Purchaser that another Sellers Agent has been
appointed with a power of representation in the same scope and this new
Sellers Agent has accepted to the other parties in writing his appointment.

preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement by itself. Unless

to the escrow account according to Clause 3.4 as well as all fees of merger
control authorities that are payable as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 



 

 **16.4** ** ****Individual and Several Liability, Intentional Behaviour,

Agreement is specifically obliged as an individual obligor, such Seller shall
be liable only individually ( _einzelschuldnerisch_ ).

 



 

 **16.4.2** ** **Unless where a Seller is obliged as an individual obligor (
_Einzelschuldner_ ), each Seller shall, in respect of its obligations under or

_teilschuldnerisch_ ) in proportion to its participation rate in the Class A
Share Capital of the Target Company as further set out in column D. of
_Schedule (A)_.

 



 

 **16.4.3** ** **In case of any intentional Breach of any of the Sellers under
this Agreement all other Sellers shall be jointly liable for all damages
resulting from such Breach on a pro rata basis corresponding to their
shareholding in the Target Company. The cap under Clause 10.5.2 shall not
apply. The total liability of the Sellers not having acted intentionally for
intentional Breaches by any other Seller under this Agreement shall be limited
to an aggregate maximum amount corresponding to EUR 20,000,000 (on a _pro
rata_ basis in relation to the shareholding sold by the respective Seller).
Claims arising from such Breaches against the Sellers not having acted
intentionally shall become time-barred after 18 months from the Closing Date,
unless the other specific time limitations as provided in Clause 10.6 apply to
the respective Breach.

 



 

 **16.4.4** ** **Unless to the extent that certain rights or claims are
conveyed by this Agreement to the or several Sellers individually, the Sellers
shall remain joint creditors ( _Gesamtgl aubiger_) of the rights and claims
under or in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **16.4.5** ** **None of the foregoing provisions shall limit in any way the
Purchasers right to seek recovery in full for any claim against any one or
more Seller(s) from the Escrow Account.

 



 

 **16.5** ** ****Notices to the Parties**

 



 

 **16.5.1** ** **A Notice shall be
