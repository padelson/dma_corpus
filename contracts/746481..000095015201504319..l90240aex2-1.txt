corporation ("BancFirst"); and The First National Bank of Zanesville, N.A., a
national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of
America ("BancFirst Bank").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the Boards of
Directors of UNB, UNB Bank, BancFirst and BancFirst Bank have determined that
it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
respective shareholders to enter into certain business combination
transactions in which BancFirst will merge with and into UNB (the "Merger");
and BancFirst Bank will merge with and into UNB Bank (the "Bank Merger") in a
merger-of-equals transaction; and   WHEREAS, as an inducement for each to
complete such process, UNB and BancFirst are each granting to the other an
option to purchase common shares on terms and conditions specified in option
agreements of even date, attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the "Option
Agreements");   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, UNB, UNB Bank,
BancFirst and BancFirst Bank, each intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I THE MERGERS   1.1 The Mergers.   (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and pursuant to the
provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the "OGCL") and applicable
federal laws and regulations, BancFirst shall merge with and into UNB in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1701.78 of the OGCL; and
the separate corporate existence of BancFirst shall cease at the Effective
Time(1). UNB shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of Ohio. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all assets and property of every description, and
every interest in the assets and property, wherever located, and the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority, of a public as well
as a private nature, of BancFirst and all obligations belonging or due to
BancFirst.   (b) Concurrently with, or as soon as possible after, the
Merger, UNB and BancFirst shall cause the Bank Merger to be completed in
accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit 2
(the "Bank Merger Agreement").  -------- (1) All capitalized terms (that

their respective Boards of Directors, may at any time change the method of

Bank (including, without limitation, the provisions of this Article I) if and
to the extent BancFirst and UNB deem such change to be desirable; provided,
however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or

materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals
or materially delay or prevent the satisfaction of any conditions to the
Closing.   1.2 CONVERSION AND CANCELLATION OF BANCFIRST SHARES. At the
Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, automatically and without

the UNB common shares as reported on  the Nasdaq National Market System
("NASDAQ") by a mutually  agreed upon authoritative source on the last day of
trading  of UNB Shares prior to the Effective Time (the "UNB Market 
Value").   (b) Any treasury shares held by BancFirst and any BancFirst
Shares owned by UNB for its own account shall be canceled and retired at the
Effective Time, and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.   1.3 BANCFIRST OPTIONS.   (a) At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option under the 1997 Omnibus Stock Option and Incentive Plan
(the "BancFirst Option Plan") shall be converted into an option to purchase
shares of the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration which would have been payable had the shares which are the
subject of the option been outstanding, equal to the exercise price per
BancFirst Share under the BancFirst Option Plan divided by the Per Share
Merger Consideration.   (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option
under the UNB Bank 1987 Stock Option Plan (the "UNB Plan I") and the UNB Bank
1997 Stock Option Plan (the "UNB    2  5   Plan II") shall be
converted into an option to purchase shares of the Surviving Corporation in
an amount equal to one share for each share purchasable under the option.  
1.4 CLOSING AND EFFECTIVE TIME. The closing of the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place, unless another date is
agreed upon by UNB and BancFirst, thirty (30) days after the satisfaction or

III. EXCHANGE OF SHARE CERTIFICATES   3.1 SHARE CERTIFICATES IN THE
MERGER.   (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall mail to each holder of record of BancFirst Shares
(and UNB Shares, should the name of the Surviving Corporation be other than
UNB), a form letter of transmittal (the "Transmittal Letter") including
instructions for use in effecting the surrender for exchange of the
certificates formerly evidencing the BancFirst Shares canceled and
extinguished as a result of the Merger and UNB shares affected by the change
in name of the Surviving Corporation (collectively, the "Certificates" and
individually, the "Certificate"). The Transmittal Letter shall specify that
the risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of
the Certificates as specified in the Transmittal Letter. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation representing shares of BancFirst, together with
such Transmittal Letter, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall thereafter be
canceled forthwith. Upon surrender of a certificate representing shares of
UNB, together with such Transmittal Letter, duly executed, the holder
of     6  9    such certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore a certificate representing the same number of shares in
the new name of the Surviving Corporation. UNB may, at its election,
designate an exchange agent to discharge its duties pursuant to this Section
3.1.   (b) In the event that any holder of BancFirst Shares is unable
to deliver the Certificate, the Surviving Corporation, in the absence of
actual notice that any BancFirst Shares theretofore represented by any such
Certificate have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to
such holder the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement upon the
presentation of all of the following:   (i) Evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving  Corporation that any such Certificate has been
lost,  wrongfully taken or destroyed;   (ii) Such security or indemnity as
may be reasonably requested by  the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
hold the Surviving  Corporation and the exchange agent harmless; and  
(iii) Evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving  Corporation
that such person is the owner of the BancFirst  Shares theretofore
represented by each Certificate claimed by  him to be lost, wrongfully taken
or destroyed and that he is  the person who would be entitled to present each
such  Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement.   (c) In the
event that delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for herein
is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered is registered, the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer; and the person requesting
such issuance or payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance or payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.1, each
Certificate representing ownership of BancFirst Shares shall represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.  
(d) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to the Surviving Corporation Shares and payable to the
holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate. After the subsequent surrender and exchange of a
Certificate, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the Surviving Corporation
Shares represented by such Certificate.    7  10   (e) No consideration
provided for herein shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation to any
former holder of BancFirst Shares in accordance with this Agreement until
such holder shall have complied with this Section 3.1.   (f) If outstanding
Certificates are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior
to the date on which such payment would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental entity, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation (and to the extent not in its
possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
exchange agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any
holder of any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. The
Surviving Corporation and the exchange agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the stock transfer books of BancFirst to establish the identity of those
persons entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, which books
shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of BancFirst Shares, the Surviving Corporation and the
exchange agent shall be entitled to deposit any Per Share Merger
Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party
and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.   3.2
PAYMENT IN SATISFACTION OF RIGHTS. All payments made upon the surrender of
Certificates pursuant to this Article III shall be deemed to have been
made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the BancFirst Shares or
UNB Shares, as the case may be, theretofore evidenced by such
Certificates.   3.3 NO FURTHER REGISTRATION OR TRANSFER. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration or transfer of BancFirst Shares
on the stock transfer books of BancFirst. In the event that, after the
Effective Time, Certificates evidencing such BancFirst Shares are presented
for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.   3.4 DISSENTING BANCFIRST SHARES.   (a) Any holder of
BancFirst or UNB Shares who seeks relief as a dissenting shareholder under
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall be entitled to
payment for such BancFirst Shares and UNB Shares only to the extent permitted
by and in accordance with the provisions of the OGCL; provided, however, that
if, in accordance with the OGCL, any Dissenting Shareholder shall forfeit
such right to payment of the fair value of the BancFirst Shares or UNB Shares
held by such Dissenting Shareholder, such BancFirst Shares or UNB Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Dissenting Shareholders shall not, after the
Effective Time, be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any dividends
or other distributions and shall be entitled only to such rights as are
afforded pursuant to the OGCL.    8  11   (b) BancFirst and UNB shall
give each other:   (i) Prompt notice of any written objections to the Merger
and any  written demands for the payment of the fair value of any  shares,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other  instruments served pursuant to
the OGCL received by either;  and   (ii) The opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and  proceedings with respect to such demands under the
OGCL.   (c) BancFirst and UNB shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for payment of fair value and shall not settle or
offer to settle any such demands, except with the prior written consent of
the other.   ARTICLE IV. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BANCFIRST AND

or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.   (c) Each BancFirst Benefit Plan which constitutes an
"employee pension plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is and has been
administered in material compliance with its governing documents and the

Nothing done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding of any asset
under or in connection with any BancFirst Benefit Plan has or will make
BancFirst, BancFirst Bank, a BancFirst Subsidiary or any affiliate liable for
any tax pursuant to Sections 4971-4980E of the Code. There is no pending or
threatened litigation, arbitration, disputed claim, adjudication, audit,

plan terminating on the date for determination. No "accumulated funding
deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with
respect to any BancFirst Benefit Plan, whether or not waived. Full
payment has been made of all amounts which BancFirst or BancFirst Bank or any
affiliate is required to have paid as contributions to or benefits under any
BancFirst Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year thereof and

condition exists and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for
termination of any BancFirst Benefit Plan, and neither BancFirst, BancFirst
Bank, a BancFirst Subsidiary nor any affiliate has incurred any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination
of any BancFirst Benefit Plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of
ERISA.   (g) BancFirst does not maintain any BancFirst Benefit Plan
which provides post-retirement medical, dental or life insurance benefits to
any former employee of BancFirst, BancFirst Bank or any BancFirst Subsidiary
nor is BancFirst obligated to provide any such benefit to any current
employee upon his or her retirement, except for the continuation coverage
required under Section 4980B of the Code.   (h) Neither BancFirst nor
BancFirst Bank, nor any BancFirst Subsidiary, participates in, or has ever
been obligated to contribute to, any multi-employer plan as such term is
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.   (i) None of BancFirst, BancFirst Bank,
a BancFirst Subsidiary nor any BancFirst Benefit Plan maintained by any of
BancFirst, BancFirst Bank, or a BancFirst Subsidiary, nor any fiduciary of
any such BancFirst Benefit Plan, has incurred any material liability to the
PBGC, the United States Department of Labor or to the IRS with respect to a
BancFirst Benefit Plan.    23  26   (j) No prohibited transaction (which
shall mean any transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any "employee
benefit plan" (as defined above) maintained by either BancFirst, BancFirst
Bank or any BancFirst Subsidiary;   (i) Which would result in the
imposition, directly or indirectly,  of an excise tax under Section 4975 of
the Code; or   (ii) The correction of which would have a material adverse
effect  on the financial condition, results of operations or business  of
BancFirst. No "reportable event," within the meaning of  Section 4043 of
ERISA, and no event described in Section  4041, 4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA
has occurred in connection  with any BancFirst Benefit Plan.   (k) Each
employee pension plan (as defined above) which is intended to be an employee
stock ownership plan, as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code, is and
has been administered in substantial compliance with the
applicable provisions of Sections 4975 and 409 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated by the IRS thereunder and, any outstanding loan to
which any such employee stock ownership plan is a party constitutes an
"exempt loan," as described in Section 54.4975-7 of the regulations
promulgated by the IRS.   (l) There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any BancFirst Benefit
Plan, which would increase the expense of maintaining such BancFirst Benefit
Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the plan
year ended immediately prior to the date hereof.   (m) Except as set forth
in the BancFirst Disclosure Schedule or as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (A) entitle any current or former employee or officer of
BancFirst or any affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other payment, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation or benefits due any such employee or officer.  
(n) With respect to each BancFirst Benefit Plan, no "reportable event" within
the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the
thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations
to Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or
4041 of ERISA has occurred.   (o) No amounts payable under the BancFirst

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and moratorium laws and
other laws of general applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally, and the effect of rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies on the
enforceability of such documents. Each loan included in the UNB Loan Assets

Governing Documents and with any and all state or federal laws applicable to
such UNB Benefit Plan. Nothing done or omitted to be done and no transaction
or holding of any asset under or in connection with any UNB Benefit Plan has

tax pursuant to Sections 4971-4980E of the Code. There is no pending or
threatened litigation, arbitration, disputed claim, adjudication, audit,
examination or other proceeding with respect to any UNB Benefit Plan or any
fiduciary or administrator thereof in their capacities as such (other
than the submission of participant claims for benefits in the ordinary course
of operation of such UNB Benefit Plans).   (f) The market value of assets
under each "employee pension plan" (as defined above) which is subject to the
provisions of Title IV of ERISA, equals or exceeds the present value of all
vested and nonvested liabilities thereunder determined in accordance with
PBGC methods, factors and assumptions applicable to an employee pension plan
terminating on the date for determination. No "accumulated funding
deficiency," as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with

the end of the most recent plan year thereof and there are no
unfunded obligations under any UNB Benefit Plan. No condition exists and no

his or her retirement, except for the continuation coverage required under

Subsidiary participates in, or has ever been obligated to contribute to, any
multi-employer plan as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.  
(i) None of UNB, UNB Bank, a UNB Subsidiary nor any UNB Benefit
Plan maintained by any of UNB, UNB Bank, or a UNB Subsidiary, nor any
fiduciary of any such UNB Benefit Plan, has incurred any material liability
to the PBGC, the United States Department of Labor or to the IRS with respect
to a UNB Benefit Plan.   (j) No prohibited transaction (which shall mean
any transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt under
Section 408 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined above) maintained by either UNB, UNB Bank or any UNB
Subsidiary;    42  45   (i) Which would result in the imposition,
directly or indirectly,  of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code;
or   (ii) The correction of which would have a material adverse effect  on
the financial condition, results of operations or business  of UNB. No
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section  4043 of ERISA, and no
event described in Section 4041, 4042,  4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred in
connection with any UNB  Benefit Plan.   (k) Each employee pension plan (as
defined above) which is intended to be an employee stock ownership plan, as
defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code, is and has been administered in
substantial compliance with the applicable provisions of Sections 4975 and
409 of the Code and the regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue
Service (hereinafter referred to as the "IRS") thereunder and, any
outstanding loan to which any such employee stock ownership plan is a party
constitutes an "exempt loan," as described in Section 54.4975-7 of the
regulations promulgated by the IRS.   (l) There has been no amendment to,
written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, any UNB Benefit Plan,
which would increase the expense of maintaining such UNB Benefit Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the plan year ended
immediately prior to the date hereof.   (m) Except as set forth in the UNB
Disclosure Schedule or as expressly provided in this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (A)
entitle any current or former employee or officer of UNB or any affiliate to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, or (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due any such employee or officer.   (n) With
respect to each UNB Benefit Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day
notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of
ERISA) nor any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has

proposal for a Competing Transaction and request the return of all
confidential information regarding Such Company provided to any such parties
prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or otherwise.   (b) Such Company agrees that during the term of
this Agreement it will not, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other agents and representatives do not, directly

event of an unsolicited written Competing  Transaction for Such Company,
engage in negotiations or  discussions with, or provide any information or

disseminated by Such Company) to, any Person  relating to any Competing
Transaction; provided,  however, that if at any time prior to the approval
of  the Merger by the shareholders of Such Company, the  Board of Directors
of Such Company determines in good  faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel (who  may be its regularly engaged outside counsel) and its 
financial advisors that it is necessary to do so in  order to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary  duties to Such Company\'s shareholders under
the OGCL,  Such Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal and 
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with  terms not
substantially more favorable to such third  party than the Confidentiality
Agreement, furnish  information to and negotiate or otherwise engage in 
discussions with any third party who delivers a written  proposal for a
superior proposal which was not  solicited, initiated, knowingly facilitated
or  encouraged after the date of this Agreement.   (c) In the event that
prior to the approval of the Merger by the Shareholders of Such Company:  
(i) The Board of Directors of Such Company receives a  Superior Proposal that

and   (ii) The Board of Directors of Such Company (subject to this  and the
following sentences) determines in the exercise  of its fiduciary obligations
under the OGCL in good  faith, after consultation with its outside counsel
(who  may be its regularly engaged outside counsel) and its  financial
advisors, to withdraw, modify or change, in a  manner adverse to the other of
Such Companies not  receiving such proposal (the "Other Company"), the 
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Such Company  of this Agreement
or recommend a Superior Proposal to  the shareholders of Such Company, then
the Board of  Directors of Such Company may provide such information  or
access or engage in such discussions or negotiations  with respect to a
Competing Transaction; provided,  however, that the foregoing shall in no way
limit or  otherwise affect the Other Company\'s right to terminate  this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) at such time  as the requirements of
such subsection have been met.  Any such withdrawal, modification or change
in the  recommendation of the Board of Directors of Such Company  of this
Agreement shall not change the approval of the  Board of Directors of Such
Company for purposes of  causing any Anti-Takeover Statute or other state law
to  be inapplicable to the Merger.   (iii) From and after the execution of
this Agreement, Such  Company will notify the Other Company if any
proposals  are received by, any information is requested from, or  any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be  initiated or continued with
Such Company or its  officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, 
attorneys, accountants or other agents or  representatives, in each case in
connection with any  Competing Transaction indicating, in connection with 
such notice the name of the Person initiating such  Competing Transaction and
the terms and conditions of  any proposals or offers. In addition, Such
Company shall  notify the Other Company in writing, if the Board of 
Directors of Such Company shall make any determination  as to a Competing
Transaction as contemplated by the  provision to the first sentence of
Section 6.3(a).   (d) As used in this Agreement, "Competing Transaction"
means any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination

respect to any recapitalization or restructuring with respect to either
BancFirst or UNB or any proposal or offer with respect to any other
transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to either BancFirst
or UNB, other than pursuant to the Merger. As used in this Agreement,
"Superior   52  55  Proposal" means a Competing Transaction regarding
which the Board of Directors of Such Company determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside counsel (who may be its regularly engaged
outside counsel) and its financial advisors that:   (i) Is necessary for
the Board of Directors of Such Company  to consider in order to act in a
manner consistent with  its fiduciary duties to Such Company\'s
shareholders  under the OGCL;   (ii) Is more favorable to the shareholders
of Such Company  than the Merger; and   (iii) It is reasonable to expect a
transaction pursuant to  such proposal could be consummated.   (e) Nothing

be materially delayed.   7.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION.   (a) Upon reasonable

this Agreement; and   (b) To obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by UNB or BancFirst or any of BancFirst Bank, UNB Bank, the
BancFirst Subsidiaries or the UNB Subsidiaries, as applicable, in connection
with the Merger or the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the Option Agreements.   7.5
[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK].   7.6 NASDAQ QUOTATION. UNB shall cause the
Surviving Corporation Shares issued in the Merger to be authorized for
quotation on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.   7.7 EMPLOYMENT AND COMPENSATION PROVISIONS. Following the
Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall use
its best efforts to resolve any material differences in terms and conditions
of employment and compensation, including but not limited to benefits, if
any, payable because of the occurrence of a Change of Control, taking into
account   55  58  that the Merger is to be a merger-of-equals transaction
that treats each party\'s directors and executive officers who are similarly
situated on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all
relevant factors, including, without limitation, duties, geographic location,
tenure, qualifications and abilities, and does not discriminate in favor of
or against directors and executives solely because they are directors or
executives of one party and not the other. This shall be accomplished as soon
as reasonably practicable without impairing vested rights or causing the
Surviving Corporation to implement short-term arrangements which are
inconsistent with orderly development of a policy consistent with
this Section 7.7.   7.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; CERTAIN INSURANCE.   (a)
From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined, the
UNB Benefit Plans and BancFirst Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of
this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to employees of UNB or
BancFirst (or BancFirst Bank, UNB Bank, the BancFirst Subsidiaries or the UNB
Subsidiaries, as applicable), respectively, covered by such plans at
the Effective Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation shall,
subject to applicable law, the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such
plans, adopt new benefit plans with respect to employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "New Benefit Plans"). Prior to the
Closing Date, UNB and BancFirst shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and
analyzing the BancFirst Benefit Plans and UNB Benefit Plans with a view
toward developing appropriate New Benefit Plans for the employees covered
thereby subsequent to the Merger. It is the intention of UNB and BancFirst to
develop New Benefit Plans, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, which, among other things:   (i) Treat similarly situated
employees on a substantially  equivalent basis, taking into account all
relevant  factors, including, without limitation, duties,  geographic
location, tenure, qualifications and  abilities; and   (ii) Do not
discriminate between employees of the Surviving  Corporation who were covered
by UNB Benefit Plans, on  the one hand, and those covered by BancFirst
Benefit  Plans, on the other, at the Effective Time.   (b) The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with
their terms all benefits vested as of the date hereof under the BancFirst
Benefit Plans or the UNB Benefit Plans or under other contracts,
arrangements, commitments, or understandings described in the BancFirst
Disclosure Schedule and the UNB Disclosure Schedule.   (c) Nothing in this
Section 7.8 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation from
amending, modifying or terminating any BancFirst Benefit Plans, UNB Benefit
Plans, or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in
accordance with their terms and applicable law.    (d) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement ("Reporting Tail Coverage") under   56 
59  BancFirst\'s and BancFirst Bank\'s existing directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance coverage for all persons who served as directors and
officers of BancFirst or BancFirst Bank or any of BancFirst Bank, UNB Bank,
the BancFirst Subsidiaries or the UNB Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to
the Effective Time in a form acceptable to BancFirst (which acceptance shall
not be unreasonably withheld) which shall provide such directors and officers
with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable
to the insured persons than, the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by BancFirst and BancFirst Bank.  
(e) Certain additional agreements of BancFirst and UNB with respect to
compensation and benefits matters are set forth on Schedule 7.8(e) hereto.  
7.9 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.   (a) In the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer or employee of BancFirst, UNB, any of BancFirst Bank, UNB Bank, the
BancFirst Subsidiaries or the UNB Subsidiaries, as applicable, including any
entity specified in the BancFirst Disclosure Schedule or the UNB Disclosure
Schedule (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to:   (i) The fact that he is or was a director, officer or 
employee of BancFirst, UNB, any of BancFirst Bank, UNB  Bank, the BancFirst
Subsidiaries or the UNB  Subsidiaries, or any entity specified in the
BancFirst  Disclosure Schedule or the UNB Disclosure Schedule or  any of
their respective predecessors; or   (ii) This Agreement, the Option
Agreements or any of the  transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby,  whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, and the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto.   (b) It is understood and
agreed that after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted of arising before or after the Effective
Time); and the Surviving Corporation, after consultation with an Indemnified
Party, shall retain counsel and direct the defense thereof; provided,
however, that by virtue of the obligations herein set forth,   57 
60  the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that, if
the Surviving Corporation fails or elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties,   (i) The Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably  satisfactory to them after
consultation with the  Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation 
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such  counsel for the
Indemnified Parties;   (ii) The Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to  this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for  all
Indemnified Parties, unless an Indemnified Party  shall have reasonably
concluded, based on the advice of  counsel and after consultation with the
Surviving  Corporation, that in order to be adequately represented, 
separate counsel is necessary for such Indemnified  Party, in which case, the
Surviving Corporation shall be  obligated to pay for such separate
counsel;   (iii) The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any 
settlement effected without its prior written consent  (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld); and   (iv) The Surviving Corporation shall
have no obligation  hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court 
of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine,  and such determination
shall have become final and  nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified  Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by 
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim  indemnification under
this Section 7.9, upon learning of  any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or  investigation, shall notify the Surviving Corporation  thereof, provided
that the failure to so notify shall  not affect the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation  under this Section 7.9 except to the extent such
failure  to notify materially prejudices the Surviving  Corporation. The
Surviving Corporation\'s obligations  under this Section 7.9 continue in full
force and effect  for a period of six years from the Effective Time (or  the
period of the applicable statute of limitations, if  longer); provided,
however, that all rights to  indemnification in respect of any claim (a
"Claim")  asserted or made within such period shall continue until  the
final disposition of such Claim.   (c) BancFirst (and the Surviving
Corporation, from and after the Effective Time) shall use its best efforts to
cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of BancFirst,
BancFirst Bank, the BancFirst Subsidiaries or any entity specified in the
BancFirst   58  61   Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by
the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by
BancFirst (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed
by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more
than three hundred percent (300%) of the current amount expended by BancFirst
(the "Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant
hereto and provided further that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.9(b), the
Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as available for the Insurance Amount.   (d) In the event the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns:   (i)
Consolidates with or merges into any other person and  shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Corporation or  entity of such consolidation or
merger; or   (ii) Transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its 
properties and assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this
section.   (e) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs and representatives.   7.10 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Bank Merger or any other merger between a Subsidiary of UNB,
on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of BancFirst on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and the
BancFirst Subsidiaries or the UNB Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole
expense of, the Surviving Corporation.   7.11 ADVICE OF CHANGES. BancFirst
and UNB shall each promptly advise the other party of any change or
event:   (a) Having a Material Adverse Effect on it; or   (b) Which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein.   59  62   ARTICLE VIII CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   8.1

obligations of the parties to effect the Merger shall be subject to the

Code; BancFirst and UNB will each  be a party to the reorganization in

others.   8.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF BANCFIRST. The obligations
of BancFirst to effect the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by BancFirst, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following

Date; provided, however, that for purposes of this paragraph, such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct unless
the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to
any qualification as to materiality set forth in such representations or
warranties, would have a Material Adverse Effect on UNB. BancFirst shall have

date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that for purposes of this
paragraph, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and
correct unless the failure or failures of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, and without
giving effect to any qualification as to materiality set forth in such
representations or warranties, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
BancFirst. UNB shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of

BANCFIRST. BancFirst shall have performed in all material respects all

UNB in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines
by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board;   (b) By either
the Board of Directors of BancFirst or the Board of Directors of UNB if any

this Agreement;   (c) By either the Board of Directors of BancFirst or the
Board of Directors of UNB if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or
before September 30, 2002, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such

Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;   (d) By either the Board of Directors of BancFirst or the
Board of Directors of UNB (provided that the terminating party is not then in
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of UNB, in the case of a termination by BancFirst or,
on the part of BancFirst, in the case of a termination by UNB, which breach,
individually or together with other such breaches, would constitute, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.2 or 8.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured
within forty-five (45) days following written notice to the party committing
such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing
Date; or   (e) By either BancFirst or UNB if any approval of the
shareholders of BancFirst or UNB required for the consummation of the Merger
shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required

become void and have no effect, and none of BancFirst, UNB, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the   62  65   officers or directors
of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder,
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that:  
(i) Sections 7.2(c) 9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any  termination of this
Agreement,   (ii) The Option Agreements remain in full force and effect 
until terminated as provided therein; and   (iii) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in  this Agreement, neither BancFirst nor UNB shall
be  relieved or released from any liabilities or damages  arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of  this Agreement.   9.3 AMENDMENT.
Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of BancFirst and UNB;
provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by the respective shareholders of BancFirst or UNB, there
may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of
this Agreement which changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered hereunder to the holders of UNB Shares, or into which BancFirst
Shares shall be converted pursuant to the Merger, other than as contemplated
by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   9.4 EXTENSION;
WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed:   (a) Extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto;   (b) Waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; and   (c) Waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
respective shareholders of BancFirst or UNB, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof which reduces the amount or changes the form
of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of BancFirst Shares
hereunder, or into which BancFirst Shares shall be converted pursuant to the
Merger, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with
an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.   63 
66   ARTICLE X GENERAL PROVISIONS   10.1 CLOSING. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Option Agreements, the Closing will take

warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Option Agreements and

agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole
or in part after the Effective Time.   10.3 EXPENSES.   (a) All costs and

connection with the Merger, shall be borne equally by BancFirst and UNB.  
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.3(a), in the event that
BancFirst or UNB makes the determination described in Section

the consent of BancFirst, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement
by UNB, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   10.11

rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties
