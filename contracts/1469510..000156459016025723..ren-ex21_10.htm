forth in the Assignments, no later than the date eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date, Buyer may furnish Seller a written notice setting forth any
matters which Buyer asserts as a breach of the special warranty of title set
forth in the Assignments. Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not

Seller promptly and Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy such consent or obtain waivers with respect thereto prior
to Closing. 

 

(b)If a Required Consent has not been obtained as of Closing with respect to
an Asset (a "Restricted Asset"), then (1) the Restricted Asset shall not be
conveyed at Closing, (2) the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted, (3) Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (and Buyer shall assist Seller as
reasonably requested) to obtain the consent of the Third Party required

shall transfer such Restricted Asset to Buyer by execution and delivery of an
instrument of conveyance substantially in the same form of the Assignment.

the Assets or located on a Lease may contain NORM and that NORM containing
materials may have been disposed of on a Lease. Buyer expressly understands
that special procedures may be required for the removal and disposal of
asbestos and NORM from the Assets if and where they may be found, and Buyer
assumes Seller's liability for or in connection with the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of any such materials present
on the Assets at or after the Effective Time in accordance with all

statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and to maintain asset accountability;

ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Article X 
Purchase Price Allocation and Tax Matters

 

Section 10.01Purchase Price Allocation. 

 

(a)Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, under Section 1060 of the Code (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate), Buyer and
Seller must report information regarding the allocation of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (as adjusted by the Purchase Price Adjustments and plus Assumed
Obligations, to the extent properly taken into account under the Code) among
the Assets to the United States Secretary of Treasury by attaching Department
of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Form 8594 to their federal income Tax
Returns for the Tax period which includes the Closing Date. Prior to the date
that is 30 days after the Final Statement is finally agreed upon, Buyer and
Seller will use their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree
regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price (plus Assumed Obligations, to
the extent properly taken into account under the Code) (the "Allocation
Schedule") and shall prepare their respective Forms 8594 with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule. The initial draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be
delivered by Seller to Buyer no fewer than 10 days following the date that the
Final Statement is finally agreed upon for Buyer's approval. Seller and Buyer
shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation
Schedule within 5 days of receipt by Buyer. If Seller and Buyer are unable to
resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by a
nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and Seller, the
costs of which shall be borne equally by the Parties. Neither Buyer nor
Seller shall take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, on
any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable Law or a
"determination," within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller
from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority
based upon or arising out of such allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such allocation.

 

Section 10.02Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for the timely
payment of, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller (and its
members, managers, officers, employees and agents) from and against, all
Transfer Taxes, if any. Buyer shall prepare and file when due all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes;
provided, however, that Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take any action
reasonably requested by Buyer that does not cause Seller to incur any cost or
inconvenience to minimize any

   

such Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes imposed on or paid by Seller shall be
promptly reimbursed to Seller by Buyer upon written demand therefor. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Transfer Taxes" means any and all Taxes
(excluding Taxes measured in whole or in part by net income), including sales,
use, excise, stock, conveyance, gross receipts, registration, business and
occupation, securities transactions, real estate, stamp, documentary,
notarial, filing, recording, permit, license, authorization and similar Taxes,
fees, duties, levies, customs, tariffs, imposts, assessments, obligations and
charges arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any and all professional costs associated with them
and the preparation and filing of their Tax Returns. 

 

Section 10.03Severance and Property Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement,

 

(a)Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of Hydrocarbons,
including severance, production and excise Taxes, and utility fees based on
volumes of hydrocarbons gathered, or that are imposed on a transactional
basis, including sales and use Taxes, in each case, with respect to the
ownership or operation of the Assets (together, "Severance Taxes"), shall be
deemed attributable to the period during which the production of the
Hydrocarbons or the transaction giving rise to such Taxes occurred, as
applicable, and liability therefor shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer as of the Effective Time as if the Tax period ended immediately prior to
the Effective Time, with the portion of Severance Taxes attributable to the
period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time being allocated to
Seller, and the portion of the Severance Taxes attributable to the period
beginning on the Effective Time being allocated to Buyer. Seller shall, in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, pay or withhold or cause to
be paid or withheld all such Severance Taxes that are due and payable prior to
the Closing Date and shall file all Tax Returns incident thereto that are due
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all such
Severance Taxes attributable to any taxable period beginning before the
Effective Time that are due and payable from the Closing Date onward and shall
file all Tax Returns incident thereto that are due on or after the Closing
Date ("Buyer-Prepared Severance Tax Returns"). Buyer shall submit each such
Buyer-Prepared Severance Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment no
fewer than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date therefor, and Buyer shall
timely file each such Buyer-Prepared Severance Tax Return incorporating any
comments received from Seller prior to the due date therefor. The Parties
agree that (i) the three immediately preceding sentences of this Section
10.03(a) are intended to solely address the timing and manner in which certain
Tax Returns relating to Severance Taxes are filed and the Severance Taxes
shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing authority, and (ii) nothing in
such sentences of this Section 10.03(a) shall be interpreted as altering the
manner in which Severance Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the
Parties.

 

(b)All ad valorem, property, and similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the Assets ("Property Taxes") assessed with respect to a
period that begins before, and ends after, the Effective Time (including such
Taxes levied for the 2016 Tax year) shall be prorated based on the number of
days in such period through the day immediately prior to the day in which the
Effective Time occurs and the number of days in such period that occur after
such day, with the portion of the Property Taxes attributable to the period
ending on the day immediately prior to the day in which the Effective Time
occurs being allocated to Seller, and the portion of the Property Taxes
attributable to the period beginning on the day in which the

   

Effective Time occurs being allocated to Buyer. Property Taxes with respect
to the Assets levied with respect to any period that begins after the
Effective Time (including such Taxes levied for the 2017 Tax year), shall be
allocated to Buyer. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Property Taxes
levied with respect to the 2016 Tax year and shall file all Tax Returns
incident thereto ("Buyer-Prepared Property Tax Returns"). Buyer shall submit
each such Buyer-Prepared Property Tax Return to Seller for its review and
comment no fewer than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date therefor, and
Buyer shall timely file each such Buyer-Prepared Property Tax Return
incorporating any comments received from Seller prior to the due date
therefor. The Parties agree that (i) the two immediately preceding sentences
of this Section 10.03(b) are intended to solely address the timing and manner
in which certain Tax Returns relating to Property Taxes are filed and the
Property Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing authority, and
(ii) nothing in such sentences of this Section 10.03(b) shall be interpreted
as altering the manner in which Property Taxes are allocated to and
economically borne by the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, "such Taxes
levied with respect to the 2016 Tax year" means the Taxes levied in 2016 that
are computed by reference to the assessed valuation that is determined based
on the price data related to production in 2015, and "such Taxes levied for
the 2017 Tax year" means the Taxes levied in 2017 that are computed by
reference to the assessed valuation that is determined based on the price data
related to production in 2016.

 

(c)To the extent the actual amount of a Severance Tax or Property Tax is not
known at the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Severance
Tax or Property Tax, as applicable, pursuant to Section 11.02 or Section
11.03, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of such Severance Tax or Property Tax for
purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of a Severance
Tax or Property Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a
Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that
was taken into account in the Final Statement as finally determined pursuant
to Section 13.01, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Severance
Tax or Property Tax that is allocable to such Party under the foregoing
provisions of this Section 10.03.

 

Section 10.04Post-Closing Tax Matters. 

 

(a)After Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall:

 

(i)reasonably cooperate and assist the other (A) in preparing any Tax Return
relating to any Tax imposed on or with respect to the Assets or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) in qualifying for any
exemption or reduction in Tax that may be available with respect to the Assets
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(ii)reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits, examinations or other
Tax proceedings by, or disputes with, taxing authorities regarding any Tax on
or with respect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

   

(iii)make available to the other, and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested, any information, records, and documents relating to a Tax incurred
or imposed with respect to the Assets or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 

(iv)provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audit, examination, or assessment that could reasonably be expected to
affect the other's Tax liability under applicable Law or this Agreement (a
"Tax Controversy"), and to promptly furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence with respect to any Tax Controversy; and allow the other to
participate, at its own expense, in any Tax Controversy, and not settle any
Tax Controversy without the prior written consent of the other, which may not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 

(b)Any payments made to any party pursuant to this Article X or Article XV
shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and
shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the
extent permitted by Law.

 

Article XI 
The Closing

 

Section 11.01Time and Place of the Closing. If the conditions referred to in
Article VIII and Article IX of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived in
writing, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Buyer, whose address is 1700 Lincoln Street,
Suite 2800, Denver, Colorado 80203, or at such other place mutually agreed by
the Parties, on October 7, 2016 (the "Scheduled Closing Date"), at 9:00 a.m.
local time, or if the conditions referred to in Article VIII and Article IX of
this Agreement have not been satisfied or waived in writing by such date, then
one (1) Business Day after such conditions have been satisfied or waived (the
"Closing Date").

 

Section 11.02Adjustments to Purchase Price at the Closing.

 

(a)The Cash Consideration shall be increased by the following amounts (without
duplication):

 

(i)an amount equal to any costs prepaid by Seller, including rentals and
insurance premiums but excluding Income Taxes, Severance Taxes, Property Taxes
and Transfer Taxes, to the extent that Buyer will receive the benefits of such
prepaid costs and insofar as such prepaid costs relate to periods of time
after the Effective Time;

 

(ii)an amount equal to all Property Expenses incurred and previously paid by
Seller (and not reimbursed by Buyer) that are attributable to the period of
time from and after the Effective Time;

   

(iii)the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons produced prior to the
Effective Time that are in storage upstream of the applicable sales meter as
of the Effective Time (but not including any Hydrocarbons constituting
linefill), such value to be the contract price in effect as of the Effective
Time (or if there is no contract price, then the posted price in the field in
which such Hydrocarbons were produced or if no such posted price exists for
such Hydrocarbons, the average market price posted in the area for such
Hydrocarbons in each case for Hydrocarbons of similar quality and grade in
effect as of the Effective Time), less all applicable Royalties, expenses,
fees, gravity adjustments and transportation expenses necessary to market such
production; 

 

(iv)all proceeds actually paid to Buyer from sales of Hydrocarbons that are
produced and saved prior to the Effective Time and any other proceeds and
revenues paid to Buyer that arise out of the ownership or operation of the
Assets prior to the Effective Time;

 

(v)an amount equal to all Severance Taxes and Property Taxes allocated to
Buyer in accordance with Section 10.03 but paid or otherwise economically
borne by Seller; and

 

(vi)any other amounts provided for in this Agreement or agreed by Buyer and
Seller.

 

(b)The Cash Consideration shall be decreased by the following amounts (without
duplication):

 

(i)an amount equal to all Property Taxes and Severance Taxes allocated to
Seller in accordance with Section 10.03 but paid or otherwise economically
borne by Buyer;

 

(ii)all proceeds actually paid to Seller from sales of Hydrocarbons (A) that
are produced and saved from and after the Effective Time and any other cash
receipts of Seller arising out of the ownership or operation of the Assets
from and after the Effective Time and (B) contained in storage upstream of the
applicable sales meter as of the Effective Time, for which an upward
adjustment was made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
11.02(a)(iii);

 

(iii)an amount equal to all Property Expenses incurred and previously paid by
Buyer (and not reimbursed by Seller) that are attributable to the Assets and
attributable to the period of time prior to the Effective Time;

 

(iv)an amount equal to all cash in, or attributable to, suspense accounts
maintained by Seller relative to the Assets for which Buyer has assumed
responsibility under Section 15.02; and

 

(v)any other amount provided for in this Agreement or agreed by Buyer and
Seller.

   

(c)The adjustments described in Section 11.02(a) and Section 11.02(b) above
are referred to as the "Purchase Price Adjustments." To the extent that the
amount of any Purchase Price Adjustment is not determinable with certainty by
Seller prior to the Closing, the amount of such Purchase Price Adjustment
shall be determined by Seller based upon Seller's good faith estimate using
accrual basis accounting principles in accordance with GAAP.

 

Section 11.03Closing Statement. On or before the Execution Date, Seller has
prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement") using
the best information available to Seller at the time and taking into account
accruals with respect to amounts not actually received or paid as of the date
of the Closing Statement, which sets forth an estimate of the Purchase Price
Adjustments. Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon the estimated Purchase Price Adjustments that
will be used for determining the Cash Consideration paid at Closing.

 

Section 11.04Revenues and Expenses. 

 

(a)For purposes of determining the amount of the adjustments to the Cash
Consideration provided for in Section 11.02, the principles set forth in this
Section 11.04 shall apply. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, Seller shall remain entitled to all of the rights of ownership
(including the right to all production, proceeds of production and other
proceeds) and shall remain responsible (by payment, through the adjustments to
the Cash Consideration hereunder or otherwise) for all Property Expenses, in
each case attributable to the Assets for the period of time prior to the
Effective Time. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to its rights of ownership (including right to
production, proceeds of production, and other proceeds), and shall be
responsible (by payment, through the adjustments to the Cash Consideration
hereunder or otherwise) for Property Expenses, in each case, attributable to
the Assets for the period of time from and after the Effective Time. All
Property Expenses attributable to the Assets, in each case that are: (i)
incurred with respect to operations conducted or production produced prior to
the Effective Time shall be paid by or allocated to Seller and (ii) incurred
with respect to operations conducted or production produced from and after the
Effective Time shall be paid by or allocated to Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) Buyer shall be entitled to receive any Unpaid Earn-Out
Payments, and (ii) Buyer shall be responsible for all Property Expenses
incurred with respect to the Boucher 2-3H well. Such amounts that are received
or paid during the Interim Period shall be accounted for in the Closing
Statement or Final Statement as applicable. Such amounts that are received or
paid after Closing but prior to the date of the payment under the Final
Statement shall be accounted for in the Final Statement.

 

(b)If, after the Parties' agreement upon the Purchase Price as adjusted by the
Purchase Price Adjustments as reflected in the Closing Statement and the Final
Statement, (i) any Party receives monies belonging to the other, including
proceeds of production, then such amount shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the end of the month in which such amounts were received, be paid over
to the proper Party, (ii) any Party pays monies for Property Expenses which
are the obligation of the other Party hereto, then such other Party shall,
within five (5) Business Days after the end of the month in which the
applicable invoice and proof of payment of such invoice were received,
reimburse the Party which paid such Property Expenses, (iii) a Party receives
an invoice of an expense or obligation (other than an expense or obligation
related

   

to Severance Taxes, Property Taxes, Income Taxes or Transfer Taxes) which is
owed by the other Party, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly
forward such invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (iv) an
invoice or other evidence of an obligation (other than an expense or
obligation related to Severance Taxes, Property Taxes, Income Taxes or
Transfer Taxes) is received by a Party, which is partially an obligation of
both Seller and Buyer, then the Parties shall consult with each other, and
each shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee.

documents shall be delivered and the following actions shall be taken by
Seller and the documents and actions set forth in Section 11.06 shall be

Article XII 
Termination

 

Section 12.01Right of Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time at or prior to the Closing:

 

(a)by written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b)by Seller, if the conditions set forth in Article VIII have not been
satisfied or waived by Seller by the Outside Date; or

 

(c)by Buyer, if the conditions set forth in Article IX have not been satisfied
or waived by Buyer by the Outside Date or if there has been a Financing
Failure;

 

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above if that Party is at the time in
material breach of any provision of this Agreement; and provided, further that
Buyer shall not be deemed to be in material breach of this Agreement if Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing on or before the Outside Date solely due to a
Financing Failure so long as Buyer has otherwise complied with its obligations
under this Agreement.

 

Section 12.02Effect of Termination. 

 

(a)If the Closing does not occur as a result of any Party exercising its right
to terminate pursuant to Section 12.01, then this Agreement shall be null and
void (except for the provisions of Article I, this Article XII, Section 13.05,
Article XVII, and Article XVIII (other than Section 18.02, Section 18.04 and
Section 18.14), all of which shall survive and continue in full force and
effect indefinitely).

 

(b)In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller
set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or waived by Seller (or would
have been satisfied except for the breach or failure of any of Seller's
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder) and (ii) the Closing has
not occurred solely as a result of the material breach or failure to be true
and correct in all material respects of any of Seller's representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, Seller's
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing,
then Buyer shall be entitled to exercise any rights at law or in equity that
Buyer may be entitled to, including rights to specific performance of this
Agreement.

 

(c)In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer
set forth in Article IX have been satisfied or waived by Buyer (or would have
been satisfied except for the breach or failure of any of Buyer's or Buyer
Parent's representations, warranties or covenants hereunder) and (ii) the
Closing has not occurred solely as a result of the breach or failure to be
true and correct in all material respects of any of Buyer's or Buyer Parent's
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, including, if and when
required, Buyer's and Buyer Parent's obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Seller shall be entitled
to exercise any rights at law or in equity that Seller may be entitled to,
including rights to specific performance of this Agreement; provided however,

   

that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12.01 following the
Outside Date because Closing failed to occur solely due to a Financing
Failure, and Buyer and Buyer Parent have otherwise not breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder in a
manner that would cause the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII,
Seller shall not be entitled to exercise any rights at law or in equity
against Buyer or Buyer Parent and this Agreement shall be null and void. 

 

Section 12.03Buyer's and Seller's Right to Specific Performance. If Buyer or
Seller has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b)
or Section 12.01(c), as applicable, then, subject to Section 12.02(b) or
Section 12.02(c), as applicable, such Party may, in lieu of terminating this
Agreement, pursue the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement
(subject to the limitation in the last sentence of Section 12.02(c)).

 

Section 12.04Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall any Party be entitled to receive any punitive,
indirect or consequential damages unless they are a part of a Third-Party
claim for which a Party is seeking indemnification under this Agreement,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE
OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY, other than
(a) loss of profits, consequential damages or punitive damages suffered by any
Third Party for which responsibility is allocated among the Parties under the
terms hereof and (b) any liability, loss, damages, cost, costs of collection
settlement and enforcement, expense, claim, award, or judgment for the benefit
of any member of the Seller Indemnitees constituting diminution in value of
the Stock Consideration as the result of any breach of a Buyer Parent
Financial Representation.

 

Article XIII 
Post-Closing Obligations

 

Section 13.01Final Accounting Statement.

 

(a)On or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a revised Closing Statement setting forth a
detailed calculation of the actual Purchase Price Adjustments (the "Accounting
Statement"). The Accounting Statement shall include any adjustment or payment
which was not finally determined as of the Closing Date and the allocation of
revenues and expenses as determined in accordance with Section 11.02. Buyer
shall provide Seller such data and information as Seller reasonably may
request supporting the amounts reflected on the Accounting Statement to permit
Seller to comment on the Accounting Statement. The Accounting Statement shall
become final and binding on the Parties on the 31st day following receipt by
Seller (the "Final Settlement Date") unless Seller gives written notice of its
disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to that date, and on
the Final Settlement Date, the Accounting Statement will be final and binding
with respect to all matters other than those specified in a Notice of
Disagreement. To the extent that Buyer has provided all necessary supporting
documentation reasonably requested by Seller with respect to the Accounting
Statement, any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in detail the dollar
amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the Parties shall

Article XV SHALL BE THE PARTIES' SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
Loss or claim of Losses arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
documents executed as part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Except for the remedies contained in this Article XV and the Special Warranty
of Title contained in the Assignment, upon Closing, Buyer waives, releases,
remises and forever discharges, and shall cause each member of the Buyer
Indemnitees to waive, release, remise and

   

forever discharge, each member of the Seller Indemnitees from any and all
Losses, suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
costs, obligations, liabilities, interest, charges or causes of action
whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which any member of the
Buyer Indemnitees might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or
arising out of the negotiation, performance and consummation of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereunder or any member of the Seller
Indemnitees's ownership, use or operation of the Assets, or the condition,
quality, status or nature of the Assets, including rights to contribution
under CERCLA or any other Environmental Law, breaches of statutory and implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common
law rights of contribution, any rights under insurance policies issued or

agreements among any members of the Seller indemnitees, even if caused in
whole or in part by the negligence (whether gross, sole, joint, active,
passive, comparative or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any released Person, invitees or third parties. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer agrees, and shall
cause each member of the Buyer Indemnitees to agree, that from and after
Closing the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnitees with respect
to any member of the Seller Indemnitees's breach of representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein or in the other agreements and
instruments delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder shall be (A) the rights to indemnity under Section

under the Special Warranty of Title contained in the Assignment, as limited by
the terms of this Agreement, and (C) the right to specific performance for the
breach or failure of the other Party to perform its obligations required to be
performed after Closing as set forth in Article XII. No Party or Person is
asserting the accuracy, completeness, or truth of any representation and
warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather the Parties have agreed that
should any representation or warranty of any Party prove inaccurate,
incomplete or untrue, the other Party shall have the specific rights and
remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy therefor, but that no other
rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise) are permitted to any Party hereto as a
result of the failure, breach, inaccuracy, incompleteness or untruth of any
such representation and warranty.

 

(g)Any claim for indemnity under this Article XV by any current or former
Affiliate, stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, agent, lender,
advisor, representative, accountant, attorney and consultant of any Party must
be brought and administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No
Indemnified Party other than Seller and Buyer shall have any rights against
Seller or Buyer under the terms of this Article XV except as may be exercised
on its behalf by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Article XV.
Seller and Buyer may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights
under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Party's affiliated with
it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other
Indemnified Party for any action or inaction under this subpart (g).

   

(h)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing
occurs, in no event shall any member of the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to
assert the breach or failure of any representation, warranty or covenant of
any member of the Seller Indemnitees or any condition precedent of Buyer in
this Agreement or any related document or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto as a basis for a claim for indemnification or defense under
this Article XV to the extent that Buyer had knowledge of such breach or
failure prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
claim for breach of a covenant, representation or warranty or for indemnity
hereunder related thereto.

 

(i)Subject to the terms hereof, each Indemnified Party shall make reasonable
efforts to mitigate or minimize all Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. If an Indemnified Party fails to so
mitigate any indemnifiable Losses under the preceding sentence, such
Indemnified Party shall have no right to indemnity hereunder with respect to
such Losses and the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion
of such Losses that reasonably could have been avoided, reduced or mitigated
had the Indemnified Party made such reasonable efforts.

 

(j)The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income tax purposes, any amounts paid or received under this Article XV as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

 

(k)Except to the extent of claims and rights expressly included as part of the
Assets, nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or otherwise waive any
recourse Seller may have against any Person that is not a member of the Seller
Indemnitees for any Losses, obligations or liabilities that may be incurred
with respect to ownership or operation of the Assets, the Assumed Obligations
or the Retained Liabilities.

 

(l)To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this Agreement, Buyer
and Seller hereby waive for themselves and their respective successors and
assigns, including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for
which such Party is liable or against which such Party indemnifies any other
Person under this Agreement. If required by applicable insurance policies,
each Party shall obtain a waiver of such subrogation from its insurers. 

 

Section 15.06Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters.

 

(a)For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Indemnifying Party" when used in
connection with particular Losses shall mean the Party having an obligation to
indemnify another Person with respect to such Losses pursuant to this
Agreement, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Losses shall mean the Persons having the right to be indemnified
with respect to such Losses by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(b)To make a claim for indemnification under any of Section 15.03 or Section
15.04, an Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim
under this Section 15.06, including the specific details of and specific basis
under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim

   

by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a "Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has
actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any)
served with respect to the Claim; provided, however, that except as provided
in Section 18.14, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice
of a Claim as provided in this Section 15.06 shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under Section 15.03 or Section 15.04 (as applicable)
to the extent and then only to the extent that failure materially prejudices
the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Claim. 

 

(c)In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party, on or before the 30th day after its receipt of the Claim
Notice, shall notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party
to admit or deny its liability to defend the Indemnified Party shall be deemed
to be a denial by the Indemnifying Party as to its liability or obligation to
defend the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to
and before the expiration of this 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d)If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right and obligation to
diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including,
subject to the terms herein, any compromise or settlement of the Claim. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 15.06. Without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, an
Indemnifying Party shall not (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any Claim which does not include an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such
Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect any Claim in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

 

(e)If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to defend the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party but
fails diligently to prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party and assume the defense of the Claim at any time
prior to its settlement or final determination. If the Indemnifying Party has
not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party for a Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, on or before the
tenth (10th) day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in writing its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party for the Claim, and (ii) if its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party is so admitted, to reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Party

   

settles any Third Party Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Party
after the Indemnifying Party has timely admitted its obligation for
indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity
with respect to the Third Party Claim.

 

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (i) to cure the Losses complained of, (ii) to admit its liability for
those Losses, or (iii) to dispute the claim for those Losses. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within this 30-day
period that it has cured the Losses, admits its liability for such Losses or
disputes the claim for those Losses, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to be disputing the claim for such Losses.

Article XVII 
Dispute Resolution

 

Section 17.01Scope; Appointment of Independent Expert. All disputes among the
Parties regarding calculation of the Final Statement or revisions thereto
("Disputes") shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
Article XVII. If the Parties are unable to reach resolution as to any such
outstanding Dispute within five (5) days following delivery of a written
notice from either Buyer or Seller to the other Party that Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, intends to submit such Dispute to the Independent Expert for
resolution pursuant to this Article XVII, then either Party may, by written
notice to the other Party (an "Election Notice"), elect to submit such Dispute
to a single arbitrator (the "Independent Expert"), who shall be selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of such Election Notice. The Independent Expert shall be a senior
partner of an independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Buyer and
Seller and shall not have had a substantial relationship with any Party or any
Affiliate of either Party during the two (2) years prior to such selection. In
the event the Parties cannot mutually agree upon an Independent Expert within
fifteen (15) days of the delivery of the Election Notice, the Independent
Expert shall be selected as would a single arbitrator in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the
"Rules"). If any Independent Expert should die, withdraw or otherwise become
incapable of serving or refuse to serve, a successor arbitrator shall be
selected in the same manner as the Independent Expert.

 

Section 17.02Additional Procedures. All proceedings under this Article XVII
shall be held in Midland, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Rules, to the extent such Rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article
XVII. The Independent Expert's final

   

determination shall be made within twenty-one (21) days after submission of
the matters in dispute to the Independent Expert, shall be in writing, and
shall set forth findings and conclusions upon which the Independent Expert
based the award. The Independent Expert shall agree to comply with the
provisions set forth in this Section 17.02 before accepting appointment. In
making its determination, the Independent Expert shall be bound by terms of
this Agreement, to the extent applicable, and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Independent Expert are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Independent Expert, however,
may not determine that (a) the value of an upward adjustment to the Purchase
Price is greater than the amount claimed by Seller, or (b) the value of a
downward adjustment to the Purchase Price is greater than the amount claimed
by Buyer. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed calculation of the Final
Statement or revisions thereto submitted by either Party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Buyer shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs. Seller
and Buyer shall each bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert.

 

Section 17.03Binding Nature. The decision and award of the Independent Expert
with respect to any arbitration under this Article XVII shall be binding upon
the Parties and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction
and enforced by either Party as a final judgment of such court.

 

Section 17.04Confidentiality. Except to the extent necessary to enforce a
decision and award of the Independent Expert, to enforce other rights of the
Parties hereunder, or as required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange on which the securities of either Party or any of its Affiliates are
listed or are in the process of being listed, the Independent Expert and
Parties, and their counsel, consultants and other representatives, shall
maintain as confidential the fact any proceedings are ongoing, or have been
completed, under this Article XVII, any decision and award of the Independent
Expert and all documents prepared and submitted by either Party, or its
counsel, consultants and other agents and representatives, in connection with
any proceedings under this Article XVII.

 

Article XVIII

release or public announcement without the express, written prior approval of
such other Party; provided, further, that nothing contained in this Section
18.03 shall be construed to require either Party to obtain approval of the
other Party to disclose information with respect to this Agreement or the

Agreement) to the extent, and then only to the extent, required by applicable
Law or necessary to comply with disclosure requirements of the SEC, New York

including financial accounting and Tax records; land, title and division of
interest files; contracts; engineering and well files; and books and records
related to the operation of the Assets prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall
retain and preserve the Documents for a period of no less than seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, and shall allow Seller or its representatives to
inspect the Documents at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during
regular business hours during such time period. Seller shall have the right
during such period to make copies of, retain and use the Documents at its
expense.

 

Section 18.05Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents to be
executed under this Agreement at the Closing constitute the entire agreement
between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter of

the Closing. Any supplement, amendment, alteration, modification or waiver of

specifically referencing this Agreement.

shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other of its provisions
(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver

only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge
that they have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this

intent or interpretation arises under this Agreement, this Agreement shall not
be construed more strictly against one Party than another on the grounds of
authorship.

which are Third-Party beneficiaries of this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall provide any benefit to any Third Party or entitle any Third
Party to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the
intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall otherwise not be construed as
a Third-Party beneficiary contract; provided that (a) only a Party will have
the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or on
behalf of any of the Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees and (b) the
Parties reserve the right to amend, modify, terminate, supplement, or waive
any provision of this Agreement or this entire Agreement without the consent
or approval of any other Person (including any Indemnified Party) and (c) no
Party hereunder shall have any direct liability to any permitted Third Party
beneficiary, nor shall any permitted Third Party beneficiary have any right to

and subject to Section 18.14(d), Seller must have received a Claim Notice on
or before the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
except that (i) Buyer may make a Claim Notice indefinitely following the

representations and warranties in Section 6.01 (Seller's Existence), Section
6.02 (Legal Power), Section 6.03 (Execution), and Section 6.04 (Brokers)
("Seller's Fundamental Representations"). Seller's indemnification obligation
under Section 15.04(b) will terminate as of the time periods set forth in this
Section 18.14(a), and after such date Seller will have no liability whatsoever
with respect to Seller's representations or warranties in this Agreement that
have expired on such date.

 

(b)Seller's Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Covenants. As a condition precedent
to any Claim for indemnity under this Agreement (i) with respect to each of
the covenants and performance obligations of Seller set forth in this
Agreement that are to be complied with or performed by Seller prior to or as
of Closing, and subject to Section 18.14(d), Seller must have received a Claim
Notice on or before the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date and (ii) to each of the covenants and performance obligations of Seller
set forth in this Agreement that are to be complied with or performed by

this Section 18.14(b), and after such date Seller will have no liability
whatsoever with respect to such covenants and performance obligations of
Seller.

 

(c)Buyer's Indemnification. As a condition precedent to any Claim for
indemnity under this Agreement with respect to the alleged breach by Buyer or
Buyer Parent of any of Buyer's or Buyer Parent's representations and
warranties in this Agreement, and subject to Section 18.14(d), Buyer must have
received a Claim Notice on or before the expiration of the applicable survival

Closing Date. Buyer's indemnification obligation under Section 15.03(b) will
terminate as of the survival periods set forth in this Section 18.14(c), and
after such date Buyer will have no liability whatsoever with respect to
Buyer's representations or warranties in this Agreement that have expired on
such date. The covenants and performance obligations of Buyer in this
Agreement and the other documents executed at Closing shall survive the
Closing indefinitely.

 

(d)Survival after Claim. Notwithstanding Section 18.14(a) through Section
18.14(c), if a valid Claim Notice has been properly delivered under Section
15.06 before the date any representation, warranty, covenant, or performance
obligation would otherwise expire under such Sections alleging a right to
indemnification or defense for Losses arising out, relating to, or
attributable to the breach of such representation, warranty, covenant, or
performance obligation, such representation, warranty, covenant, or
performance obligation shall continue to survive as to the matters asserted in
the Claim Notice until the claims asserted in such Claim Notice that are based
on the breach of such representation, warranty, covenant, or performance
obligation have been fully and finally resolved.

counterparts may be combined into one composite instrument for all purposes.
All counterparts together shall constitute only one Agreement, but each
counterpart shall be considered an original.
