included in such tax return all tax items required to be included therein,
shall furnish a copy of such tax return to VTDC; (iii) file timely such tax
return with the appropriate taxing authority; and (iv) be responsible for the
timely payment of all taxes due with respect to the period covered by such tax
return. The Partnership shall determine the amount of tax due that is not

amount equal to the VTDC Tax Obligation not later than five (5) calendar days

assets or operations of Parkway Pipeline. If any such amounts are not known at

estimate, with a true-up payment to be made from VTDC to the Partnership, or
vice-versa, as promptly as practicable after exact amounts are determined.

qualification is required, except where the lack of such qualification,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Business or Parkway Pipeline, taken as a whole. Parkway
Pipeline does not own or hold an ownership interest in any other entities and
there are no outstanding obligations to make any investment in any other
Person. VTDC has heretofore delivered to the Partnership true, complete and
correct copies of the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of Parkway Pipeline, and no breach or violation thereof has occurred
and is continuing.

(c) The Parkway Pipeline Interests have been duly authorized and validly
issued in accordance with the limited liability company agreement of Parkway
Pipeline, and are fully paid (to the extent required under the limited
liability company agreement of Parkway Pipeline) and nonassessable (except as
such nonassessability may be affected by matters described in Sections 18-607
and 18-804 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act). VTDC owns the
Parkway Pipeline Interests free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than
transfer restrictions under applicable federal and state securities laws.
There is no other membership or equity interest (or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any membership or equity interest) in
Parkway Pipeline that is outstanding.

(d) No Person (other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries) has any
statutory or contractual preemptive or other right of any kind (including any
right of first offer or refusal) to acquire any securities of Parkway
Pipeline.

4.2 Authorization. VTDC and each of its Affiliates party to a VTDC Ancillary
Document has full corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
power and authority, as the case may be, to execute, deliver, and perform this
Agreement and any VTDC Ancillary Documents to which it is a party. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by VTDC and of the VTDC
Ancillary Documents by each of VTDC and its Affiliates party thereto and the

 consummation by VTDC and its Affiliates of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company action, as the case may be.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by VTDC and constitutes,
and each VTDC Ancillary Document executed or to be executed by VTDC or any
Affiliate thereof party thereto has been, or when executed will be, duly
executed and delivered by VTDC or such Affiliate thereof party thereto and
constitutes, or when executed and delivered will constitute, a valid and
legally binding obligation of each such party thereto, enforceable against
each such party thereto in accordance with their terms, except to the extent
that such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar
Applicable Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and (b)
equitable principles which may limit the availability of certain equitable
remedies (such as specific performance) in certain instances.

4.3 No Conflicts or Violations; No Consents or Approvals Required. Except with
respect to Right-of-Way Consents, the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each VTDC Ancillary Document by VTDC and its Affiliates
party thereto does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will not, (a) violate, conflict with, or result in any
breach of any provision of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or
similar governing documents of VTDC or such Affiliates; (b) violate in any
material respect any Applicable Law to which VTDC or such Affiliates is

to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or require any notice or trigger
any rights to payment or other compensation under (in each case, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) any Contract to which VTDC or Parkway
Pipeline is a party or by which any such entity is bound, or that could
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except with respect to Right-of-Way Consents and
Environmental Permits, no Consent of any Governmental Authority or third party
is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or any VTDC Ancillary Document by VTDC and its Affiliates party
thereto or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

duly executed and delivered by the Partnership and constitutes, and each
Partnership Ancillary Document executed or to be executed by the Partnership

executed and delivered by the Partnership (or Affiliate thereof party thereto)
and constitutes, or when executed and delivered will constitute, a valid and
legally binding obligation of the Partnership (or Affiliate thereof party

certain equitable remedies (such as specific performance) in certain
instances.

5.3 [Intentionally Omitted.]

 Document of the Partnership Ancillary Documents to which it is a party or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

5.5 Absence of Litigation. There is no Claim pending or, to the knowledge of
the Partnership, threatened against the Partnership or its Affiliates relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
or which, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to materially

agreements under this Agreement or the Partnership Ancillary Documents to
which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS

6.1 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Omnibus Agreement, each of the
Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be
taken all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time after the Closing
Date any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the Parties and their duly authorized representatives shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take all such action.

 6.2 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such further actions, including
obtaining or transferring to the other Party all necessary Permits, Consents,
orders and Contracts, and executing and causing its Affiliates to execute such
further documents, as may be necessary or reasonably requested by the other
Party in order to effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and to provide such other Party with the intended benefits of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Parties have used their good faith
efforts to identify all of the assets and operations to be assigned,
transferred and conveyed to the Partnership in connection with this Agreement.
However, due to the age of some of the assets or operations and the
difficulties in locating appropriate data with respect to some of the assets
included in these operations, it is possible that some of the assets intended
to be assigned, transferred or conveyed ultimately to the Partnership were not
identified and therefore are not assigned, transferred or conveyed (directly
or indirectly) to the Partnership as of the Effective Time. To the extent that
any assets were not identified but form an integral part of the assets and
operations of Parkway Pipeline and are not needed for the conduct of any of
the businesses conducted by Valero and its Affiliates, then the intent of the
Parties is that all such unidentified assets are intended to be assigned,
transferred and conveyed to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement. To the
extent any such assets are identified at a later date, the Parties shall take
all appropriate action required in order to assign, transfer or convey such
assets to the Partnership. Likewise, to the extent that any assets or
operations that are indirectly assigned, transferred or conveyed to the
Partnership hereunder are later identified by the Parties as assets and
operations that the Parties did not intend to assign, transfer or convey to
the Partnership, the Parties shall take all appropriate action required to
assign, transfer or convey such assets and operations to VTDC.

6.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Following the Closing Date, the Parties shall
cooperate fully with each other and shall make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting Party, and to any
Governmental Authority responsible for the administration of any tax, all
information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax
liabilities of Parkway Pipeline for all periods at or prior to the Effective
Time and any information which may be relevant to determining the amount
payable hereunder, and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof.

6.4 Cooperation for Litigation and Other Actions. Each Party shall cooperate
reasonably with each other Party, at the requesting Party's expense (but
including only out-of-pocket expenses to unaffiliated third parties,
photocopying and delivery costs and not the costs incurred by either Party for
the wages or other benefits paid to its officers, directors or employees), in
furnishing reasonably available information, testimony and other assistance in
connection with any Claims or other disputes involving any of the Parties
hereto (other than in connection with disputes between the Parties).

 6.5 Retention of and Access to Books and Records.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event before 90 calendar days after
the Closing Date, VTDC will deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Partnership, the Books and Records that are in the possession or control of
VTDC or its Affiliates.

(b) The Partnership agrees to afford VTDC and its Affiliates and their
respective accountants, counsel and other designated individuals, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable request, at a mutually agreeable time,
full access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records at no
cost to VTDC or its Affiliates (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses); provided that such access will not be construed to require the
disclosure of Books and Records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-
client, work product or like privilege; provided, further, that in the event
of any litigation, nothing herein shall limit either Party's rights of
discovery under Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentences, the Partnership agrees to provide VTDC and its Affiliates
reasonable access to and the right to make copies of the Books and Records
after the Closing for the purposes of assisting VTDC and its Affiliates (i) in
complying with VTDC's obligations under this Agreement and any Ancillary
Document; (ii) in adjusting, prorating and settling the charges and credits
provided for under this Agreement and any Ancillary Document; (iii) in
preparing tax returns; (iv) in responding to or disputing any tax audit; (v)
in asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any Claim or dispute, known
or unknown, under this Agreement; (vi) in asserting, defending or otherwise
dealing with any third-party Claim or dispute by or against VTDC or its
Affiliates relating to Parkway Pipeline; or (vii) in performing their
obligations under the Omnibus Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Indemnification. From and after the Closing and subject to the provisions
of this Article VII, (a) VTDC agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Partnership Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Partnership
Indemnified Costs and (b) the Partnership agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the VTDC Indemnified Parties from and against any and all VTDC
Indemnified Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 7.5, the
foregoing indemnification is intended to be in addition to and not in
limitation of any indemnification to which the Parties may be entitled under
the Ancillary Documents. For purposes of calculating Indemnified Costs (but
not determining whether a breach has occurred), no effect shall be given to
any qualifications of representations or warranties as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect.

7.2 Defense of Third-Party Claims. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt
written notice to VTDC or the Partnership, as applicable (the "Indemnifying
Party"), of the commencement or assertion of any Claim by a third party
(collectively, a "third-party action") in respect of which such Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder. Any failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it, he, or she may have to such Indemnified Party under this Article VII
unless the failure to give such notice materially and adversely prejudices the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume
control of the defense of, settle, or otherwise dispose of such third-party
action on such terms as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that:

 (a) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such third-party action (provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys' fees of the Indemnified Party
if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such
third-party action; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have charge of
such third-party action; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to such Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party;
or (iv) the Indemnified Party's counsel shall have advised the Indemnified
Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there
is a material conflict of interest that could violate applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel);

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such third-party action or any
liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment could have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Indemnified Party;

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in
respect of such third-party action; and

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third-party action
(i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense within a
reasonable length of time or (ii) to the extent the third-party action seeks
an order, injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
which, if successful, would materially adversely affect the business,
operations, assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of
any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party.

The Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense
of any third-party action pursuant to this Article VII and, in connection
therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals as may
be reasonably requested.

7.3 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 7.2 because no
third-party action is involved, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such Indemnified
Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. Subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 7.4(a), the failure of the Indemnified
Party to exercise promptness

 in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless the
resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such claim.

7.4 Limitations. The following provisions of this Section 7.4 shall limit the
indemnification obligations hereunder:

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Indemnified Costs
pursuant to this Article VII unless a written claim for indemnification in
accordance with Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 is given by the Indemnified Party
to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto on or before 5:00 p.m., San
Antonio, Texas time, on or prior to the date that is 18 months after of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that written claims for indemnification (i)
for Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.6 (the
"Fundamental Representations") may be made at any time and (ii) for
Indemnified Costs arising out of a breach of any covenant may be made at any
time prior to the expiration of such covenant according to its terms.

(b) An Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay for any Indemnified
Costs under this Article VII until the amount of all such Indemnified Costs
exceeds, in the aggregate, $1,500,000 (with the Indemnifying Party only being
responsible for Indemnified Costs in excess of such amount). The aggregate
liability of an Indemnifying Party under this Article VII shall not exceed
$30,000,000. The limitations in the previous two sentences shall not apply to
Indemnified Costs to the extent such costs arise out of a breach of (i) any
Fundamental Representations or (ii) any covenant set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing Date,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Partnership's and the other Partnership Indemnified Parties' and VTDC's and
the other VTDC Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
the Indemnified Costs shall be in accordance with, and limited by, the
provisions set forth in this Article VII.

7.5 Remedies Under Ancillary Documents. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that this Article VII is not the remedy for and does not limit the Parties'
remedies for matters covered by the indemnification provisions contained in
the Ancillary Documents. Any indemnification obligation of VTDC to the
Partnership Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, or the Partnership to the
VTDC Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, pursuant to this Article VII
shall be reduced by an amount equal to any indemnification recovery by such
Indemnified Parties pursuant to the other Ancillary Documents between the
Parties to the extent that such other indemnification recovery arises out of
the same event or circumstance giving rise to the indemnification obligation
of VTDC or the Partnership, respectively, hereunder.

7.6 Tax Related Adjustments.

VTDC and the Partnership agree that any payment of Indemnified Costs made
hereunder will be treated by the Parties on their tax returns as an adjustment
to the Cash Consideration.

 7.7 Express Negligence Rule. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS,
RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION OF THE ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART
FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
