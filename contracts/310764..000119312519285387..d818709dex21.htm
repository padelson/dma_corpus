19

    

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted
hereunder and not prohibited by applicable Law) of the Offer Conditions, Buyer
shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to), at or as promptly as practicable
following the Expiration Time (but in any event within two (2) Business Days
thereafter), accept for payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and, at or as promptly as practicable following the
Acceptance Time (but in any event within two (2) Business Days (calculated as
set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) thereafter),
pay (by delivery of funds to the depositary for the Offer) for all Shares

(c) Buyer expressly reserves the right at any time to, in its sole discretion,

20

    

(e) Subject to _Article_ __ _ VI_, Buyer may or shall (in which case Parent
shall cause Buyer to), as applicable, extend the Offer from time to time as
follows:

(i) Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) extend the Offer for the

waiver is permitted under this Agreement or applicable Law), then Buyer shall
(and Parent shall cause Buyer to) extend the Offer on one or more occasions in
consecutive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such
period to end at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last Business Day of such
period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and the Company)
in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s); _provided_
, that if Buyer determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Offer Condition
set forth in _paragraph 1(b)_ of _Annex I_ is not reasonably likely to be
satisfied within such ten (10) Business Day extension period, then Buyer may
extend the Offer on such occasion for periods of up to twenty (20) Business
Days; _provided_ , _further_ , that (x) Buyer shall not be required to, and
shall not without the prior written consent of the Company, extend the Offer
to a date later than the Outside Date (as the Outside Date may be extended
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_) and (y) if the only remaining
unsatisfied Offer Condition is the Minimum Tender Condition, Buyer shall not
be required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in consecutive
periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such period to end at
5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or such
other duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and the Company);

(iii) Buyer may extend the Offer to such other date and time as may be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in writing; or

(f) Following the Acceptance Time, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer
to) (and the Offer Documents shall so indicate) provide a subsequent offering

promulgated under the Exchange Act of not less than ten (10) Business Days
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). In the event that prior to the expiration of the Subsequent
Offering Period, Buyer or Parent has publicly announced its intention
to, subject to the terms of this Agreement, effectuate the Asset Sale, Buyer
shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) (and the Offer Documents shall so
indicate) extend the Subsequent Offering Period for at least five (5) Business
Days to permit any remaining Minority Shareholders to tender their Shares in
exchange for the Offer Consideration (such extension, the " _Minority Exit
Offering Period_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event that promptly following the Expiration Time, Buyer or
Parent has publicly announced its intention to, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, effectuate the Mergers, Buyer shall not be required to provide a
Subsequent Offering Period (or, for the avoidance of doubt, a Minority Exit
Offering Period), but may do so if Buyer chooses.

Buyer; _provided_ , that the Company may, following reasonable consultation
with Parent and Buyer, and, to the extent requested in writing by Parent and

(or any Subsequent EGM) solely to the extent reasonably necessary (x) to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the relevant EGM Materials that the

is necessary to comply with applicable Law is made available to the Companys
shareholders in advance of the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) or (y) on no more
than two (2) occasions of not more than ten (10) Business Days each, to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the approvals set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.4(a)_, if as of the date of the scheduled EGM (or any Subsequent EGM)
there are not sufficient proxies that have been received approving such
matters. In the event the EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) is adjourned,

 



28

    

 postponed or cancelled and reconvened pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall duly give notice of and reconvene the EGM or such Subsequent EGM
on a date scheduled by mutual agreement of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, acting reasonably, or, in the absence of
such agreement, as soon as practicable following the date of such adjournment,
postponement or cancellation but, in any event, no later than the day that is
thirty-five (35) days following the date of such adjournment, postponement or
cancellation (or, in the case of any Subsequent EGM, a date that shall be
prior to the date on which the Expiration Time shall occur).

 

(d) The Company shall ensure that the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted in compliance in all material respects

applicable requirements with respect to the holding of an EGM (or
Subsequent EGM, if applicable) to act upon the Merger Resolutions, including
the pre-meeting filing and publication requirements of the DCC with respect to
the First-Step Merger (collectively, the " _Dutch Merger Publication_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, the
date of the Dutch Merger Publication shall be on a date reasonably selected by
Parent and the Company, and the EGM (or Subsequent EGM, if applicable) shall
be held in compliance with all applicable Laws as promptly as practicable
after the date of the Dutch Merger Publication. The approval of the matters
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)(i)-(viii)_ shall be the only matters that
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at
the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM), unless otherwise reasonably proposed by the
Company and approved in advance in writing by Parent and Buyer (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that
the Company may hold the EGM or Subsequent EGM simultaneously with the
Companys annual meeting if the Company otherwise complies with the
timing requirements for the EGM or Subsequent EGM set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 2.4_, including the obligation to hold such meeting as promptly as
practicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
Board determines in its reasonable discretion that any additional
shareholders resolutions should be adopted in order to approve any of the
Signing Transactions, or if the Governance Resolutions, the Asset Sale
Resolutions, the Merger Resolutions or the Demerger Resolutions have not been
adopted at the EGM, then, in each case, the Company shall, following
consultation with Parent and Buyer, duly call and give notice of another EGM
(a " _Subsequent EGM_ "), which will take place at a date determined by the
Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent and Buyer and not later than a
date that is prior to the date of the Expiration Time, at which the Governance
Resolutions, the Asset Sale Resolutions, the Merger Resolutions or the
Demerger Resolutions, or the additional resolutions as referred to above will
be considered or reconsidered, as the case may be.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
Companys rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _
VI_ the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) in accordance with and
subject to the terms hereof and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, in each case, will not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal

 



29

    

 (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or any Change of Board Recommendation.
Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _
VI_, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the
shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) or any matters relating thereto.

upon the Closing, be comprised of at least seven (7) directors, (i) at least
five (5) of whom may be designated in writing by Parent and Buyer (the "
_Buyer Directors_ "), in their sole discretion, as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event prior to convening the EGM, and (ii) at least two
(2) of whom shall initially be current non-executive directors of the Company
designated by the Company and Buyer by mutual written agreement (if and to the
extent that they shall agree to continue to serve on the Company Board after
the Closing), and who are at all times independent from Parent and Buyer and
at all times qualify as independent in accordance with the independence
standards set forth in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016; _provided_ ,
that, if and to the extent that the current non-executive directors of the
Company do not agree to serve on the Company Board after the Closing, Buyer

are at all times independent from Parent and Buyer and who at all times
qualify as independent in accordance with the independence standards set forth
in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event prior to convening the EGM (the directors so
designated, " _Independent Directors_ ").

(b) Each Independent Director shall resign from, and the Company shall take
such other action reasonably necessary to ensure that each such Independent
Director ceases to be a director of, the Company Board upon the earliest to
occur of (i) such time after the Acceptance Time as Buyer and its Affiliates,
in the aggregate, own one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
Shares, including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Mergers and
(ii) the Second Step Distribution having been made and the
subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the Company (the " _Liquidation_ ")
having been completed.

(c) If, at any time after the Closing, an Independent Director resigns from,

independent (in accordance with the independence standards set forth in the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016) from Parent or Buyer, in each case,
prior to the date of resignation contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_,
Parent shall procure that the respective Independent Director is replaced by a
new director who is independent from Parent and Buyer and at all times
qualifies as independent in accordance with the independence standards set
forth in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016.

 



30

    

(d) Parent and Buyer shall supply to the Company in writing any information
regarding the Buyer Directors, and (to the extent applicable) those
Independent Directors designated by Buyer, as required by applicable Laws in
connection with the appointment of the Buyer Directors, and (to the extent
applicable) those Independent Directors designated by Buyer, to the Company
Board, and Parent and Buyer shall be solely responsible for any such
information.

(e) In addition to the discharge contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)(v)_,
Buyer shall (i) at the first annual or extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders of the Company held after the Closing, cause all members of the
Company Board resigning effective upon the Acceptance Time to be fully and
finally discharged for their acts of management or supervision, as applicable
and (ii) at the first annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders
of the Company held after the resignation of an Independent Director, cause
such Independent Directors to be fully and finally discharged for his or her
acts of supervision; _provided_ , that such discharge will be limited to the
extent provided by general principles of Dutch law as in effect from time to
time.

(f) Notwithstanding any other required vote, the affirmative vote of the
Independent Directors shall also be required for approving:

(i) any restructuring that would reasonably be expected to lead to a dilution
of the shareholdings of the Minority Shareholders, other than (A) pursuant to
a rights issue by the Company or any other share issue where the Minority
Shareholders have been offered an opportunity to subscribe pro rata in
accordance with their then existing shareholding in the Company (
_voorkeursrecht_ ), (B) the Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution and the
Liquidation, (C) the Mergers or (D) the Compulsory Acquisition; and

 

(ii) any other form of unequal treatment that prejudices or would reasonably
be expected to prejudice or negatively affect the value of the Shares or
voting rights attached to the Shares held by the Minority Shareholders, but in
any event not including (A) the Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution and
the Liquidation, (B) the Mergers or (C) the Compulsory Acquisition. 

Section 2.6 _Further Actions_. If requested by the other party, the Company,

ARTICLE III 

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) other than with respect to _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ ,
_3.5_ and _3.6_ , as otherwise disclosed in Company SEC Documents filed with
(or furnished to) the SEC on or after January 1, 2018 and at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the date hereof and to the extent publicly available on
the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval system (excluding
any disclosures in "risk factors" or otherwise relating to or in any "forward-
looking statements" legend or other statements that are cautionary, predictive
or forward-looking in nature) or (b) as otherwise disclosed in the particular
section or subsection of the confidential disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent and Buyer prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section
and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably
apparent on its face from the text of such disclosure), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Buyer as follows:

 

Section 3.1 _Organization and Corporate Power_. The Company is duly organized
and validly existing under the Laws of The Netherlands, with all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is a
corporation or other entity validly existing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and authority and all
authorizations, licenses and Permits necessary to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to hold such authorizations, licenses and Permits has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or authorized to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction (to the extent such concept exists in such
jurisdiction) in which its ownership of property or the conduct of
its business as now conducted makes such qualification or authorization
necessary, except where the failure to

 



35

    

 be so qualified, authorized or in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
been heretofore made available to Parent and Buyer. Such Company
Organizational Documents are currently in full force and effect, and the
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof.

Section 3.2 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement,
and the consummation by the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries of the
Signing Transactions, including the Offer, the Compulsory Acquisition, the
Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution, the Liquidation and the Mergers, are
within the corporate powers of the Company and its applicable
Subsidiaries and have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, except
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, no other corporate proceedings on

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution
or delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions,
will, either individually or together with a termination of employment or
service, (i) result in any payment (including severance, bonus or other
similar payment) becoming due to any current or former officer, director,
independent contractor or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) increase or otherwise enhance any benefits or compensation otherwise
payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any payments or benefits under any Company Plan, (iv)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to set aside any assets to fund
any benefits under any Company Plan, (v) result in the forgiveness in whole
or in part of any outstanding loan made by the Company to any Person or (vi)
result in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code or in the imposition of an excise Tax under Section
4999 of the Code. Within sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement,
the Company will complete and furnish to Parent an analysis, which will
identify individuals who qualify as "disqualified individuals" under Section
280G of the Code and any payment to any such "disqualified individuals" that
could constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) and that may not be deductible for federal income Tax purposes by
virtue of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse
any individual with respect to any Tax, including under Sections 409A or 4999
of the Code.

(g) With respect to each Non-U.S. Plan, except as would not be expected to
result in any material Liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries:
(i) such Non-U.S. Plan is in compliance and has been administered at all
times in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Laws of such
jurisdiction in which such Non-U.S. Plan is established and the terms of the
applicable Non-U.S. Plan; (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such
Non-U.S. Plan has obtained from the Governmental Body having jurisdiction
with respect to such Non-U.S. Plan required determinations, if any, that such
Non-U.S. Plan is in material compliance with the Laws of the relevant
jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to give effect to
such Non-U.S. Plan; (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
pending investigations by any Governmental Body involving any Non-U.S. Plan;
and (iv) other than as provided in this Agreement, the consummation of the
contemplated transactions will not by itself create or together with another
event result in any Liability with respect to such Non-U.S. Plan. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has (i) ever been an employer in relation
to, participated in or had any liability (whether prospective, contingent or
otherwise) to or in respect of a Non-U.S. Plan constituting a defined benefit
pension program or scheme or (ii) otherwise entered into any contractual
arrangements, or given any promises or commitments, relating to providing
defined benefit pension benefits to employees or officers (or former employees
or officers) pursuant to any plan, program, agreement or arrangement that
would constitute a Non-U.S. Plan. If required under applicable laws to be
funded and/or book-reserved, such Non-U.S. Plan is funded and/or book-
reserved, as appropriate, to the extent so required by applicable Laws. Each
Non-U.S. Plan that is intended to qualify for tax-preferential treatment under
applicable Laws so qualifies, except as could not reasonably be expected to
result in a material Liability to the Company. Each Non-U.S. Plan required to
be registered has been so registered

Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.3_ and (ii) the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to or result in a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition
Proposal;  _provided_ that (x) the Company shall not, and shall instruct (and
use it reasonable best efforts to cause) its Representatives not to, disclose
any non-public information to such Person (or its Representatives) unless the
Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such
Person with confidentiality provisions that, taken as a whole, are not less
restrictive to the

 



73

    

 other Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y)
the Company shall, substantially concurrently, and in any event within one (1)
Business Day, provide or make available to Parent any information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other
Person (or any of its Representatives) that was not previously provided or
made available to Parent and Buyer. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Representatives not to, release any Person from, or waive, amend or modify
any provision of, or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company is a party;  _provided_ that,
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive
any such standstill provision to the extent necessary to permit the
applicable Person (if such Person has not been solicited in material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company
Board, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing that
the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent
(including regarding any such Acquisition Proposal) in accordance with, and
otherwise complying with, this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
after receipt thereof) notify Parent of (i) the receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any requests for
information, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued related to the foregoing and (ii) the terms and conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal (including a copy of such Acquisition Proposal) and any
such inquiry, proposal, offer, request or contact. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any case, within one
(1) Business Day of any significant development, discussions or negotiations)
as to the status of such Acquisition Proposal or such inquiry, proposal,
offer, request or contact, including by promptly (and in no event later than
one (1) Business Day) (A) disclosing to Parent the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal or such inquiry, proposal, offer, request or
contact and (B) providing to Parent complete, unredacted copies of any
correspondence, proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft and final
agreements (including schedules, exhibits and any other written
materials related thereto (including any financing commitments received))
(and comments thereon) exchanged between the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Person (or any of its Representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal or
such inquiry, proposal, offer, request or contact, on the other hand.

(d) Except as expressly provided in Section 5.3(e), the Company Board and
each committee thereof shall not (i) approve or adopt, or permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to (and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will) enter into or execute, any binding or non-binding letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement relating to or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_) an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") or publicly propose to take such action or (ii)
make a Change of Board Recommendation.

 



74

    

(e) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ or any other provision of
this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time:

(i) the Company may make a Change of Board Recommendation and terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal (so
long as prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness
of, such termination, the Company pays to Parent the termination fee payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_) if: (A) the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, constitutes a
Superior Proposal; (B) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take any
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; (C) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to
terminate this Agreement to enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement
and provided Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreement (and related
agreements); (D) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have instructed
(and shall have used it reasonable best efforts to cause) its Representatives
to negotiate, in good faith, with Parent and its Representatives during the
Notice Period, to the extent Parent requests to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and (E) no
earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisor), after taking into consideration the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement that Parent has committed in
writing to make during the Notice Period, that (x) the Acquisition Proposal
that is subject of the Determination Notice continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (y) that the failure to take any such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 

(ii) other than in connection with or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board may make a Change of Board Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event if (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take any such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; (B) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect
a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice shall reasonably specify the
facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening Event and for
the Company Boards determination to effect the Change of Board
Recommendation); (C) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
instructed (and shall have used it reasonable best efforts to cause) its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith, with Parent and its
Representatives during the Notice Period, to the extent Parent requests to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a
manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action; and (D)
no earlier than the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel), after considering
the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement that
Parent has committed in writing to make during the Notice Period, that the
failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ apply to any change to the
financial terms or any other material terms of any applicable Superior
Proposal with respect to clause (i) and require a revised Determination Notice
and a new Notice Period.

 



75

    

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement prohibits the Company Board or a
committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure if the Company Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure
to make such statement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;  _provided_ that (A) in no event shall this _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_ permit the Company Board or a committee thereof to make a Change of
Board Recommendation except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, (B) in no event shall this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_
affect, modify or supplement the definition of Change of Board Recommendation
(or to the consequences thereof in accordance with this Agreement) and (C)
any such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) that does not expressly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation.

 

Section 5.4 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and each of its other
Subsidiaries to, maintain for each individual employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at the Closing (each, a " _Current Employee_ ") for the
period commencing at the Closing and ending on the earlier of (x) the date
that is twelve (12) months following the Closing and (y) the date on which
the employment of a Current Employee terminates (i) each of base compensation
and a target annual cash incentive compensation or bonus opportunity (but
subject to applicable adjustments to performance goals following the Closing)
at least as favorable as that provided to the Current Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) benefits that are at least as favorable
in the aggregate to the benefits (excluding for such purposes any equity or
equity-related awards, and any defined benefit pension benefits) maintained
for and provided to the Current Employee as of immediately prior to the
Closing and (iii) severance benefits that are at least as favorable as the
severance benefits (excluding for such purposes any equity or equity-related
severance benefit terms) provided by the Company to the Current Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
compensation to be paid or benefits to be provided to a Current Employee
pursuant to clauses (i)  (iii) be less than the amount required to be paid or
benefits provided to such Current Employee under any severance, employment or
similar agreement.

 

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may pay to each Current Employee
who is employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries at the time of such
payments the following cash bonuses (i) at the time such bonuses are typically
paid, up to an amount due to such Current Employee under the Companys annual
bonus program assuming the achievement of applicable performance metrics at
the higher of "target" or actual performance in 2019, (ii) up to an amount due
to such Current Employee under the Companys annual bonus program assuming if
the Acceptance Time occurs in 2020, the achievement of applicable performance
metrics at "target" in 2020 with such amount being pro-rated for the portion
of the year prior to the Acceptance Time and (iii) up to an amount due to such
Current Employee under the Companys annual bonus program assuming if the
Acceptance Time occurs in 2021, (A) the achievement of applicable performance
metrics at the higher of "target" or actual performance in 2020, and (B) the
achievement of applicable performance metrics at "target" in 2021 with such
amount being pro-rated for the portion of the year prior to the Acceptance
Time; _provided_ that in no event shall any cash bonus paid to a Current
Employee for in the year in which the Acceptance Time occurs be less than the
amount required to be paid to such Current Employee under any severance
agreement.

 



76

    

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and each of its other
Subsidiaries to, cause service rendered by Current Employees to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing to be taken into account for all
purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits (including vacation and
severance, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) and as required by law under
all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Company and its other Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Buyer Plan_ "), to the same extent as such service was taken into
account under the corresponding Company Plans immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ , that, the foregoing will not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company to not, subject Current
Employees to any eligibility requirements, waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations under any Buyer Plan for
any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Closing. If
Parent chooses to have the Current Employees commence participation in an
applicable Buyer Plan other than on the first day of a plan year, Parent will
use commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide, credit under such employee benefit plans for any
eligible expenses incurred by such Current Employees and their
covered dependents under a Company Plan during the portion of the year prior
to the Closing for purposes of satisfying all co-payments, co-insurance,
deductibles, maximum out-of-pocket requirements, and other out-of-pocket
expenses or similar requirement under any such plans applicable to such
Current Employees and their covered dependents in respect of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents obligations
under this sentence shall be subject to its receipt of, using reasonable best
efforts to obtain, all necessary information, from either the Company or the
Current Employee, related to such amounts paid by such Current Employee.

 

(d) If directed in writing by Parent at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate, effective as of at least
one (1) day prior to the Closing Date, any and all Company Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ").
If so directed, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company has
taken action to terminate each Company 401(k) Plan (effective as of no later
than one (1) day prior to the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, no provision of
this Agreement (i) prohibits Parent or the Company from amending or
terminating any individual Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (ii) requires Parent or the
Company to keep any Person employed for any period of time, or (iii)
constitutes the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company
Plan or employee benefit plan. No Current Employee or any other individual
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries has any third-party beneficiary or
other rights with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

 



77

    

Section 5.5 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Buyer agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the present (as
of the Closing) or former directors or officers of the Company (each, together
with such Persons heirs, executors, or administrators, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents shall survive
the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six
(6) years from the Closing, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Company to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect immediately prior to the Closing solely
with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any present (as of the Closing)
or former director or officer of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or
any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause the
Company to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or applicable Law, Parent and Buyer shall, jointly and severally,
from and after the Closing, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each Indemnified Party against any liability for or on
account of Tax in connection with a Post-Offer Reorganization, including all
obligations to pay a judgment, settlement, or penalty and reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with any Action in relation thereto; _provided_ that,
any such indemnity of an Indemnified Party shall be limited to Taxes incurred
by such Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
the Company and not as a holder of any of the Shares or other equity of the
Company.

 

(c) The Company may purchase prior to the Closing, and if the Company does not
purchase prior to the Closing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company to purchase at or after the Closing, a tail policy under the
current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained at
such time by the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Closing, which tail policy (i) will be effective for a period
from the Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the
Closing with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred prior to or at the Closing and (ii) will contain coverage that is at
least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by
such existing policies; _provided_ , that, the premium for such tail policy
may not be (and Parent shall not be required to cause the Company to expend)
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid
prior to the Closing. Parent shall cause any such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect for their full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Company.

 



78

    

(d) Without limiting any of the rights or obligations under this  _Section_
__ _ 5.5_, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Parent shall cause
the Company to keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and
conditions of, (solely with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Closing) any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between
or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party
providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party that has been
made available to Parent.

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ will survive the consummation of the
Transactions and is intended to benefit, and after the Closing is enforceable
by, any Person or entity referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_. The
indemnification and advancement provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ is
not exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Party is entitled
whether pursuant to Law, Contract, or otherwise. If Parent, Buyer, the Company
or any of their respective successors or assigns (other than pursuant to the
Transactions) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or a majority of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or Buyer, as
applicable, shall make proper provisions such that such successors or assigns
assume the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

 

Section 5.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer by or
before the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree to, (i) in cooperation and consultation
with each other, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and all other filings required pursuant to applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of any
applicable legal deadline (provided that the filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act must be made within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Company and Parent in writing) and (ii) to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested (including pursuant to a second or similar request) pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. Parent shall, with the reasonable
cooperation of the Company, be responsible for making any filing or
notification, or draft filing as may be the case, required or advisable under
foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and Parent in
writing. The parties shall also consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by, or on behalf of, such party in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall have the right to devise, control and direct the strategy and timing
for, and making of all material decisions relating to (and shall take the
lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Body relating
to), obtaining any Consent of a Governmental Body contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, including resolving any Action related to any such
Consent; _provided_ , further, however, in devising, controlling and directing
the strategy and timing for, and making of all material decisions relating to
obtaining any Consent of a Governmental Body contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 5.6_ Parent must at all times use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Offer by or before the Outside Date. Without

 



79

    

 limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (A) to furnish to the other
such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with obtaining any Consent or any Action under or relating to
Antitrust Laws or otherwise relating to or to facilitate a Remedy, (B) to give
each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental
Body relating to any Antitrust Laws or otherwise relating to or to facilitate
a Remedy, (C) to give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such
meetings, (D) to the extent practicable, to give each other reasonable advance
notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental Body
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (E) if any Governmental Body initiates a
substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, to promptly
notify the other party of the substance of such communication, (F) to provide
each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon
all substantive written communications (including any analyses, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental
Body regarding any Antitrust Laws and (G) to provide each other with copies
of all substantive written communications to or from any Governmental Body
relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or provision of copies by
one party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if
appropriate. Parent shall pay all filing fees in connection with any filings
that may be required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_.

 

(b) In furtherance of, and without limiting the efforts referenced in
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents,
clearances or approvals required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EU Merger Regulation and any other federal,
state or foreign law, regulation, or decree designed to prohibit, restrict, or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade or significant impediment of effective competition (collectively "
_Antitrust Laws_ ") to enable all waiting periods under applicable Antitrust
Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate impediments under applicable
Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental Body, in each case, to cause the
Offer to be consummated prior to the Outside Date, including if necessary to
obtain clearance by any Governmental Body before the Outside Date, offering,
negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of
any and all of the capital stock, assets, equity holdings, rights, products or
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), and any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the foregoing and
any other action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_, a " _Remedy_
"). To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
enter into one or more agreements requested by Parent to be entered into by
any of them prior to the Closing with respect to a Remedy. Without Parents
prior written consent, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to) take or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done, offer,
negotiate, commit to or effect any Remedy. For the avoidance of doubt, no
party hereto (or their respective Subsidiaries) shall be required pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ to offer, negotiate, commit to or effect any Remedy
that is not conditioned upon the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parents obligation to (and to cause its
Subsidiaries (including for this purpose, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect any Remedy or Remedies shall be
limited to (a) total ankle replacement products and services and (b) other
products and services that represented, individually or in the aggregate, less
than $25,000,000 of annual revenue generated during the 2018 fiscal year, and
(ii) Parent shall not be required to (or to cause its Subsidiaries (including
for this purpose, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to) offer, negotiate,
commit to or effect any Remedy or Remedies other than those required pursuant
to clause (i).

 



80

    

(c) Without limiting the obligations in clauses (a) and (b) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_, including Parents right to devise, direct and control
the strategy relating to such actions or proceedings, in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Body challenging any Transaction, each of
Parent, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction, decision or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions.

(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time, each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties with
respect to any Contracts to which it (or any Subsidiary of the Company) is a
party as may be necessary for the consummation of the Transactions or required
by the terms of any Contract as a result of the execution, performance or
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, except in order to effect a Remedy in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in no event will Parent, Buyer
or the Company be required to pay or make or commit to pay or make (and
without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall pay or make or commit to pay or make), prior to the
Closing, any fee, penalty or other consideration or any other accommodation
to any third party to obtain any consent, approval or waiver required with
respect to any such Contract.

 

(e) Each of the parties agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and
the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VI_ , it will not, and will ensure that none of their
respective Subsidiaries will, consummate, or enter into any agreement
providing for, any investment, acquisition or other business combination that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation
of the Transactions.

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to not, and Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to not, issue any press release, announcement or other public
statement concerning the Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
consent of the other (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), except any release or announcement required by
applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq, the New York Stock
Exchange or any other stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance; it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party. The restrictions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ do not
apply to communications by the Company or Parent in connection with a Change
of Board Recommendation.

 



81

    

Section 5.8 _Approval of Compensation Actions_. Prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take all such actions
as may be required to approve, as an employment compensation, severance, or
other employee benefit arrangement in accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto, any and all Compensation
Actions taken after January 1 of the current fiscal year and prior to the
Acceptance Time that have not already been so approved. For the purposes of
this Agreement, " _Compensation Action_ " means any (a) granting by the
Company or its Subsidiaries to any present or former director or officer of
any increase in compensation or benefits or of the right to receive any
severance or termination compensation or benefit; (b) entry by the Company or
its Subsidiaries into any employment, consulting, indemnification,
termination, change of control, non-competition, or severance agreement with
any present or former director or officer, or any approval, amendment, or
modification of any such agreement; or (c) approval of, amendment to, or
adoption of any Company Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall permit the Company to take any action that
would be prohibited under any other provision of this Agreement, including 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_.

Section 5.9 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall provide written notice of the anticipated effective date
of the Closing to holders of the Convertible Notes, the Trustee, and the
paying agent and conversion agent identified in the Indentures within three
(3) Business Days after the date of this Agreement and in accordance with
Section 14.01(b)(iii) of each of the Indentures. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall not make any change to the terms of the Indentures relating to
the Convertible Notes without the prior written consent of Parent. In
addition, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions as may be
required in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Indentures
including, without limitation, delivery, issuance or entry into, as
applicable, of any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or

Section 6.5 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Article
VI_ , this Agreement (other than the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and _Article VII_
, each of which will survive any termination hereof) will become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party (or of any of its
Representatives) and all rights and obligations of any party shall cease;
_provided_ , _however_ , no such termination will relieve any Person of any
liability for damages resulting from a material breach of this Agreement that
is a consequence of an act or omission intentionally undertaken by the
breaching party with the knowledge that such act or omission would, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in a material breach of this Agreement (an
" _Intentional Breach_ ") or fraud. Parent shall cause the Offer to be
terminated immediately after any termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.4(b)_; or

 



92

    

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by (x) Parent pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 6.4(a)_ on the basis of a breach of a covenant or agreement, (y) either
party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ or (z) either Parent or the Company
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ (and in the
case of a termination by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6.2(c)_, at the time of the expiration or termination of the Offer, all
Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the delivery of
the certificate referenced in Paragraph 2(c) of _Annex I_ to this Agreement,
which certificate only need to be capable of being delivered) were satisfied
or waived), (B) in any such termination under clause (A), prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement has
been publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn or is otherwise known to
the Company Board and not withdrawn (publicly, if publicly disclosed) and (C)
within twelve (12) months after any such termination, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of when or whether such transaction
is consummated) or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated ( _provided_ , that
for purposes of clause (C) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(iii)_, references
to "fifteen percent (15%) or more " in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
will be substituted for "more than fifty percent (50%)");

 

Then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$150,000,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts designated by Parent. Any payment required to be made (1)
pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (i)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ will be paid
concurrently with such termination, (2) pursuant to  _clause_ __ _ (ii)_ of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ will be paid no later than two (2) Business Days
after such termination and (3) pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ will be payable to Parent upon the earlier of the
consummation of, or entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to, the transaction referenced therein. The Company will not be
required to pay the termination fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_
more than once.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Buyer
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or
Buyer their costs and expenses in connection with such suit (including
reasonable attorneys fees), together interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

Section 6.6  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions.

 

Section 6.7 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. The Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein, except that the Minimum
Tender Condition may only

 



93

    

 be waived by Parent or Buyer with the prior written consent of the Company.
Any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of
any party to assert any rights or remedies will not constitute a waiver of
such rights or remedies.

foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Buyer to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the
Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Buyer at

of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time. In addition, each of the
foregoing conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing conditions;
the exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not mean that
such event may not be included in another condition.
