Stem,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;<U>Stem</U>&rdquo;), pursuant to a business combination agreement (the &ldquo;<U>Transaction
Agreement</U>&rdquo;) to be entered into among Stem, STPK <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">and a newly formed entity formed
for the purpose of consummating the Transaction</FONT> (the &ldquo;<U>Company</U>&rdquo;), STPK is seeking commitments from interested
investors to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &ldquo;<U>Shares</U>&rdquo;), of STPK,
for a purchase price of $10.00 per share. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the undersigned (the &ldquo;<U>Investor</U>&rdquo;)
for the subscribed Shares (as set forth on the signature page&nbsp;hereto) is referred to herein as the &ldquo;<U>Subscription
Amount</U>.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection therewith,
and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions,
set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Investor and STPK agree as follows:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

The Investor hereby irrevocably subscribes for and agrees to purchase from STPK such number of Shares as is set forth on the signature
page&nbsp;of this Subscription Agreement on the terms provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in <U>Section&nbsp;9 </U>below, in the event that the Closing Date (as defined below) shall not have occurred by the Outside Date
(as defined in the Transaction Agreement) this Subscription Agreement shall be void and of no further effect and any monies paid
by the Investor to STPK in connection herewith shall immediately be returned to the Investor.</P>

The closing of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby (the &ldquo;<U>Closing</U>&rdquo;) is contingent upon the substantially
concurrent consummation of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and  promptly following the consummation
of the Transaction. Upon (i)&nbsp;satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3</U> below and (ii)&nbsp;delivery
of written notice from (or on behalf of) STPK to the Investor (the &ldquo;<U>Closing Notice</U>&rdquo;), that STPK reasonably
expects the closing of the Transaction to occur on a specified date that is not less than four (4)&nbsp;business days after the
date on which the Closing Notice is delivered to the Investor (the &ldquo;<U>Closing Date</U>&rdquo;), the Investor shall deliver
to STPK, two (2)&nbsp;business days prior to the Closing Date, the Subscription Amount by wire transfer of United States dollars
in immediately available funds to the account(s)&nbsp;specified by STPK in the Closing Notice, to be held in escrow until the
Closing. On the Closing Date, STPK shall issue the Shares to the Investor and subsequently cause the Shares to be registered in
book entry form in the name of the Investor on STPK&rsquo;s share register, and the Subscription Amount shall be released from
escrow automatically and without further action by STPK or the Investor. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force or effect, without any liability to either party hereto, if STPK notifies the Investor in writing that it has
abandoned its plans to move forward with the Transaction and/or terminates the Investor&rsquo;s obligations without the delivery
of the Shares having occurred. In the event that the consummation of the Transaction does not occur within one (1)&nbsp;business
day after the anticipated Closing Date specified in the Closing Notice, STPK shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2)&nbsp;business
days after the anticipated Closing Date specified in the Closing Notice) return the funds so delivered by the Investor to STPK
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Investor. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement,
 &ldquo;business day&rdquo; shall mean any day other than (a)&nbsp;any Saturday or Sunday or (b)&nbsp;any other day on which banks
located in New York, New York are required or authorized by applicable law to be closed for business.</P>

it will file with the SEC (at its sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering such resale (the &ldquo;<U>Registration

(ii)&nbsp;the tenth (10<SUP>th</SUP>) business day after the date STPK is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier)
by the SEC that the Registration Statement will not be &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; or will not be subject to further review ((i)&nbsp;and
(ii)&nbsp;collectively, the &ldquo;Effectiveness Deadline&rdquo;);</FONT> <I>provided, </I>that if such falls on a Saturday, Sunday

the SEC is open for business. STPK will provide a draft of the Registration Statement to the undersigned for review at least two
(2)&nbsp;business days in advance of filing the Registration Statement. In no event shall the undersigned be identified as a statutory
underwriter in the Registration Statement unless requested by the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the SEC prevents STPK
from including any or all of the shares proposed to be registered under the Registration Statement due to limitations on the use
of Rule&nbsp;415 of the Securities Act for the resale of the Shares by the applicable stockholders or otherwise, such Registration
Statement shall register for resale such number of Shares which is equal to the maximum number of Shares as is permitted by the
SEC. In such event, the number of Shares to be registered for each selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement shall
be reduced pro rata among all such selling shareholders. STPK will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continuous
effectiveness of the Registration Statement until all such securities cease to be Registrable Securities (as defined below) or
such shorter period upon which all Investors with Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement have notified
STPK that such Registrable Securities have actually been sold. STPK will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)&nbsp;cause
the removal of all restrictive legends from any Shares being sold under the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144
under the Securities Act (&ldquo;<U>Rule&nbsp;144</U>&rdquo;) at the time of sale of such Registrable Securities and, at the request
of an applicable holder, cause the removal of all restrictive legends from any Registrable Securities held by such an applicable
holder that may be sold by such an applicable holder without restriction under Rule&nbsp;144, including without limitation, any
volume and manner of sale restrictions, and (ii)&nbsp;cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any,
to the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under subclause (i)&nbsp;upon the receipt of such supporting documentation,
if any, as reasonably requested by such counsel. STPK will use commercially reasonable efforts to file all reports, and provide
all customary and reasonable cooperation, necessary to enable Investor to resell Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement or Rule&nbsp;144, as applicable, qualify the Registrable Securities for listing on the applicable stock exchange, update
or amend the Registration Statement as necessary to include Registrable Securities and provide customary notice to holders of
Registrable Securities. &ldquo;<U>Registrable Securities</U>&rdquo; shall mean, as of any date of determination, the Shares and
any other equity security of STPK issued or issuable with respect to the Shares by way of share split, dividend, distribution,
recapitalization, merger, exchange, replacement or similar event or otherwise. As to any particular Registrable Securities, once
issued, such securities shall cease to be Registrable Securities (i)&nbsp;when they are sold, transferred, disposed or exchanged
pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;the earliest of (A)&nbsp;the fourth anniversary
of the Closing, (B)&nbsp;such time that such holder has disposed such securities pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144 or (C)&nbsp;if Rule&nbsp;144(i)&nbsp;is
no longer applicable to STPK or Rule&nbsp;144(i)(2)&nbsp;is amended to remove the reporting requirement preceding a disposition
of securities, such time that such holder is able to dispose of all of its, his or her Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144
without any volume limitations thereunder, (iii)&nbsp;when such securities shall have ceased to be outstanding or (iv)&nbsp;when
such securities have been sold in a private transaction in which the transferor&rsquo;s rights under this Section&nbsp;7(a)&nbsp;are
not assigned to the transferee of such securities. The Investor agrees to disclose its ownership to STPK upon request to assist
it in making the determination described above. The Investor agrees that STPK may suspend the use of any such registration statement,
for a continuous period of up to 60 days not more than twice in any 12-month period, if it determines that in order for such registration
statement not to contain a material misstatement or omission, an amendment thereto would be needed to include information that
would at that time not otherwise be required in a current, quarterly, or annual report under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &ldquo;<U>Exchange Act</U>&rdquo;). STPK&rsquo;s obligations to include the Shares issued pursuant to this Subscription Agreement
(or shares issued in exchange therefor) for resale in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the Investor furnishing in
writing to STPK such information regarding the Investor, the securities of STPK held by the Investor and the intended method of
disposition of such Shares as shall be reasonably requested by STPK to effect the registration of such Shares, and shall execute
such documents in connection with such registration as STPK may reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder
in similar situations.</P>
