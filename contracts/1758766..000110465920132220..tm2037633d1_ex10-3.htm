Star Peak Energy Transition Corp.

  

1603 Orrington Avenue, 13th Floor

  

Evanston, Illinois 60201

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the proposed business combination (the " _Transaction_ ")
between Star Peak Energy Transition Corp., a Delaware corporation (including
any successor thereto pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, "
_STPK_ "), and Stem, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Stem_ "), pursuant to a
business combination agreement (the " _Transaction Agreement_ ") to be
entered into among Stem, STPK and a newly formed entity formed for the
purpose of consummating the Transaction (the " _Company_ "), STPK is seeking
commitments from interested investors to purchase shares of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Shares_ "), of STPK, for a
purchase price of $10.00 per share. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by
the undersigned (the " _Investor_ ") for the subscribed Shares (as set forth
on the signature page hereto) is referred to herein as the "
_Subscription Amount_."

  



  

In connection therewith, and in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants, and subject to the conditions, set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Investor and STPK
agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Subscription_. The Investor hereby irrevocably subscribes for and agrees to purchase from STPK such number of Shares as is set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement on the terms provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in _Section 9 _below, in the event that the Closing Date (as defined below) shall not have occurred by the Outside Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) this Subscription Agreement shall be void and of no further effect and any monies paid by the Investor to STPK in connection herewith shall immediately be returned to the Investor.

  



  

2. _Closing_. The closing of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the Transaction. The Closing shall occur on the date of, and promptly following the consummation of the Transaction. Upon (i) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section 3_ below and (ii) delivery of written notice from (or on behalf of) STPK to the Investor (the " _Closing Notice_ "), that STPK reasonably expects the closing of the Transaction to occur on a specified date that is not less than four (4) business days after the date on which the Closing Notice is delivered to the Investor (the " _Closing Date_ "), the Investor shall deliver to STPK, two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Subscription Amount by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by STPK in the Closing Notice, to be held in escrow until the Closing. On the Closing Date, STPK shall issue the Shares to the Investor and subsequently cause the Shares to be registered in book entry form in the name of the Investor on STPK's share register, and the Subscription Amount shall be released from escrow automatically and without further action by STPK or the Investor. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, without any liability to either party hereto, if STPK notifies the Investor in writing that it has abandoned its plans to move forward with the Transaction and/or terminates the Investor's obligations without the delivery of the Shares having occurred. In the event that the consummation of the Transaction does not occur within one (1) business day after the anticipated Closing Date specified in the Closing Notice, STPK shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business days after the anticipated Closing Date specified in the Closing Notice) return the funds so delivered by the Investor to STPK by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Investor. For purposes of this Subscription Agreement,  "business day" shall mean any day other than (a) any Saturday or Sunday or (b) any other day on which banks located in New York, New York are required or authorized by applicable law to be closed for business.

materially affect the legal authority of STPK to comply in all material
respects with the terms of this Subscription Agreement; (ii) result in any

Section 13 of this Subscription Agreement; (iv) those required by the New

capital stock of STPK consists of (i) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.0001 per share (" _Preferred Stock_ ") and (ii) 440,000,000

h. As of the date hereof, STPK has not received any written
communication from a governmental entity that alleges that STPK is not
in compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable law,

the date hereof (the " _Other Subscription Agreements_ ") with certain other
investors (the " _Other Investors_ "), STPK has not entered into any side
letter or similar agreement with any Other Investor in connection with such

of (i) securities of STPK by existing securityholders of STPK, which may be
effectuated as a forfeiture to STPK and reissuance, or (ii) securities to be
issued to the direct or indirect securityholders of the Company pursuant to
the Transaction Agreement). No Other Subscription Agreement includes terms

Investor than the Investor hereunder, and such Other Subscription Agreements
have not been amended or modified in any material respect following the date
of this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

l. As of their respective filing dates, all reports required to be
filed by STPK with the SEC (the " _SEC Reports_ ") complied in all material

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, as of the date hereof, there is no (i) investigation, action,
suit, claim or other proceeding, in each case by or before any governmental
authority pending, or, to the knowledge of STPK, threatened against STPK or
(ii) judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order of any governmental entity

 _Confidential_

  



  

6. _Investor Representations and Warranties_. The Investor represents and warrants to STPK that:

  

  



  

a. The Investor (i) is a "qualified institutional buyer" (as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ")), or an institutional "accredited investor" (within the
meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act), in each case, satisfying
the applicable requirements set forth on _Schedule A_ , and an "Institutional
Account" as defined in FINRA Rule 4512(c) (ii) is acquiring the Shares only
for his, her or its own account and not for the account of others, or if the
Investor is subscribing for the Shares as a fiduciary or agent for one or
more investor accounts, the Investor has full investment discretion with
respect to each such account, and the full power and authority to make the
acknowledgements, representations and agreements herein on behalf of each
owner of each such account and (iii) is not acquiring the Shares with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act (and shall provide the requested information
on _Schedule A_ ). The Investor is not an entity formed for the specific
purpose of acquiring the Shares.

  



  

b. The Investor understands that the Shares are being offered in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of the
Securities Act and that the Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act. The Investor understands that the Shares may not be resold,
transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Investor absent an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act except (i) to STPK
or a subsidiary thereof, (ii) to non-U.S. persons pursuant to offers and
sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S
under the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to another applicable exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in each of cases
(i) and (iii) in accordance with any applicable securities laws of the states
and other jurisdictions of the United States, and that any certificates or
book entry positions representing the Shares shall contain a restrictive
legend to such effect; as a result the Investor may not be able to readily
resell the Shares and may be required to bear the financial risk of an
investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of time. The Investor
acknowledges that the Shares will not immediately be eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Investor
understands that it has been advised to consult legal counsel prior to
making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Shares.

  



  

c. The Investor understands and agrees that the Investor is
purchasing the Shares from STPK. The Investor further acknowledges that
there have been no representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
to the Investor by Stem, STPK, or their respective officers or directors,
expressly or by implication, other than those representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements included in this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

d. The Investor's acquisition and holding of the Shares will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any applicable
similar law.

  



  

e. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor has
received such information as the Investor deems necessary in order to make an
investment decision with respect to the Shares, including, with respect to the
Company, STPK, the Transaction and the business of Stem. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Investor acknowledges that he, she or it has
reviewed STPK's filings with the SEC. The Investor represents and agrees that
the Investor and the Investor's professional advisor(s), if any, have had the
full opportunity to ask such questions, receive such answers and obtain such
information as the Investor and such Investor's professional advisor(s), if
any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with respect to
the Shares.

  



  

f. The Investor became aware of this offering of the Shares solely
by means of direct contact between the Investor and STPK, the Company, Stem
or a representative of STPK, the Company or Stem or by means of contact from
Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or any of their
affiliates (the " _Placement Agents_ "), and the Shares were offered to
the Investor solely by direct contact between the Investor and STPK, the
Company, Stem or a representative of STPK, the Company or Stem or by contact
between the Investor and the Placement Agents. The Investor did not become
aware of this offering of the Shares, nor were the Shares offered to the
Investor, by any other means. The Investor acknowledges that the Shares (i)
were not offered by any form of general solicitation or general advertising
and (ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a public offering under,
or in a distribution in violation of, the Securities Act, or any state
securities laws. Investor acknowledges that it is not relying upon, and has
not relied upon, any statement, representation or warranty made by any person,
firm or corporation (including, without limitation, the Company, STPK, Stem,
the Placement Agents or their respective affiliates or any of its or their
control persons, officers, directors, employees or representatives), other
than the representations and warranties of STPK contained in _Section 5_ of
this Subscription Agreement, in making its investment or decision to invest in
STPK. The Investor further acknowledges that the Placement Agents have not
made, do not make and shall not be deemed to make any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to STPK, the Company, Stem, this
offering or the Transaction.

 _Confidential_

  



   



  

g. The Investor acknowledges that it is aware that there are
substantial risks incident to the purchase and ownership of the
Shares, including those set forth in STPK's filings with the SEC. The
Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the
Shares, and the Investor has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as
the Investor has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

  



  

h. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), the
Investor has adequately analyzed and fully considered the risks of an
investment in the Shares and determined that the Shares are a suitable
investment for the Investor and that the Investor is able at this time and in
the foreseeable future to bear the economic risk of a total loss of the
Investor's investment in STPK. The Investor acknowledges specifically that a
possibility of total loss exists.

  



  

i. In making its decision to purchase the Shares, the Investor has
relied solely upon independent investigation made by the Investor and STPK's
representations in _Section 5_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Investor has not relied on any statements or other information
provided by or on behalf of the Placement Agents or any of their
affiliates or any of their control persons, officers, directors, employees or
representatives concerning the Company, STPK, Stem, the Transaction, the
Transaction Agreement, the Subscription Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the Shares or the offer and sale of the
Shares.

  



  

j. The Investor understands and agrees that no federal or state
agency has passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Shares
or made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

  



  

k. The Investor has been duly formed or incorporated and is
validly existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation, with power and authority to enter into, deliver
and perform its obligations under this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

l. The execution, delivery and performance by the Investor of this
Subscription Agreement are within the powers of the Investor, have been duly
authorized and will not constitute or result in a breach or default under or
conflict with any order, ruling or regulation of any court or other tribunal
or of any governmental commission or agency, or any agreement or other
undertaking, to which the Investor is a party or by which the Investor is
bound, and, if the Investor is not an individual, will not violate any
provisions of the Investor's charter documents, including, without
limitation, its incorporation or formation papers, bylaws, indenture of trust
or partnership or operating agreement, as may be applicable. The signature on
this Subscription Agreement is genuine, and the signatory, if the Investor is
an individual, has legal competence and capacity to execute the same or, if
the Investor is not an individual the signatory has been duly authorized to
execute the same, and this Subscription Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Investor, enforceable against the Investor in
accordance with its terms except as may be limited or otherwise affected by
(i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, or
(ii) principles of equity, whether considered at law or equity.

  



  

m. The Investor is not (i) a person or entity named on the List of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons administered by the U.S.
Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ") or in any
Executive Order issued by the President of the United States and administered
by OFAC (" _OFAC List_ "), or a person or entity prohibited by any OFAC
sanctions program, (ii) a Designated National as defined in the Cuban Assets
Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515, or (iii) a non-U.S. shell bank or
providing banking services indirectly to a non-U.S. shell bank. The Investor
agrees to provide law enforcement agencies, if requested thereby, such records
as required by applicable law, provided that the Investor is permitted to do
so under applicable law. If the Investor is a financial institution subject to
the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.) (the " _BSA_ "), as
amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the " _PATRIOT Act_ "), and its
implementing regulations (collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), the
Investor maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with
applicable obligations under the BSA/PATRIOT Act. To the extent required, it
maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its
investors against the OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List. To
the extent required by applicable law, the Investor maintains policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the funds held by the Investor
and used to purchase the Shares were legally derived.

 _Confidential_

  



  

n. No disclosure or offering document has been prepared by the
Placement Agents in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares.

  



  

o. The Placement Agents and each of their directors, officers,
employees, representatives and controlling persons have made no
independent investigation with respect to STPK or the Shares or the accuracy,
completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the Investor by STPK.

  



  

p. In connection with the issue and purchase of the Shares, the
Placement Agents have not acted as the Investor's financial advisor or
fiduciary.

  



  

q. At the Closing, the Investor will have sufficient funds to pay
the Subscription Amount and consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares
when required pursuant to this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

7. _Registration Rights_

  



  

  

a. In the event that the Shares are not registered in connection
with the consummation of the Transaction, STPK agrees that, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) calendar
days after the consummation of the Transaction), it will file with the SEC
(at its sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering such
resale (the " _Registration Statement_ "), and it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as
soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of
(i) sixty (60) calendar days after the filing thereof (or, in the event the
SEC reviews and has written comments to the Registration Statement, the
ninetieth (90th) calendar day following the filing thereof) and (ii) the
tenth (10th) business day after the date STPK is notified (orally or in
writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Registration Statement
will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to further review ((i) and (ii)
collectively, the "Effectiveness Deadline"); _provided,_ that if such falls on
a Saturday, Sunday or other day that the SEC is closed for business, the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to the next business day on
which the SEC is open for business. STPK will provide a draft of the
Registration Statement to the undersigned for review at least two (2)
business days in advance of filing the Registration Statement. In no event
shall the undersigned be identified as a statutory underwriter in the
Registration Statement unless requested by the SEC. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the SEC prevents STPK from including any or all of the shares
proposed to be registered under the Registration Statement due to limitations
on the use of Rule 415 of the Securities Act for the resale of the Shares by
the applicable stockholders or otherwise, such Registration Statement shall
register for resale such number of Shares which is equal to the maximum number
of Shares as is permitted by the SEC. In such event, the number of Shares to
be registered for each selling shareholder named in the Registration Statement
shall be reduced pro rata among all such selling shareholders. STPK will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continuous effectiveness
of the Registration Statement until all such securities cease to be
Registrable Securities (as defined below) or such shorter period upon which
all Investors with Registrable Securities included in such Registration
Statement have notified STPK that such Registrable Securities have actually
been sold. STPK will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the
removal of all restrictive legends from any Shares being sold under the
Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act ("
_Rule 144_") at the time of sale of such Registrable Securities and, at the
request of an applicable holder, cause the removal of all restrictive legends
from any Registrable Securities held by such an applicable holder that may be
sold by such an applicable holder without restriction under Rule 144,
including without limitation, any volume and manner of sale restrictions, and
(ii) cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if
any, to the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under subclause
(i) upon the receipt of such supporting documentation, if any, as reasonably
requested by such counsel. STPK will use commercially reasonable efforts to
file all reports, and provide all customary and reasonable cooperation,
necessary to enable Investor to resell Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement or Rule 144, as applicable, qualify the Registrable
Securities for listing on the applicable stock exchange, update or amend the
Registration Statement as necessary to include Registrable Securities and
provide customary notice to holders of Registrable Securities. " _Registrable
Securities_ " shall mean, as of any date of determination, the Shares and any
other equity security of STPK issued or issuable with respect to the Shares by
way of share split, dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger,
exchange, replacement or similar event or otherwise. As to any particular
Registrable Securities, once issued, such securities shall cease to be
Registrable Securities (i) when they are sold, transferred, disposed or
exchanged pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) the earliest of (A) the fourth anniversary of the
Closing, (B) such time that such holder has disposed such securities pursuant
to Rule 144 or (C) if Rule 144(i) is no longer applicable to STPK or Rule
144(i)(2) is amended to remove the reporting requirement preceding a
disposition of securities, such time that such holder is able to dispose of
all of its, his or her Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 without
any volume limitations thereunder, (iii) when such securities shall have
ceased to be outstanding or (iv) when such securities have been sold in a
private transaction in which the transferor's rights under this Section 7(a)
are not assigned to the transferee of such securities. The Investor agrees to
disclose its ownership to STPK upon request to assist it in making the
determination described above. The Investor agrees that STPK may suspend the
use of any such registration statement, for a continuous period of up to 60
days not more than twice in any 12-month period, if it determines that in
order for such registration statement not to contain a material misstatement
or omission, an amendment thereto would be needed to include information
that would at that time not otherwise be required in a current, quarterly, or
annual report under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange
Act_ "). STPK's obligations to include the Shares issued pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement (or shares issued in exchange therefor) for resale in
the Registration Statement are contingent upon the Investor furnishing
in writing to STPK such information regarding the Investor, the securities of
STPK held by the Investor and the intended method of disposition of such
Shares as shall be reasonably requested by STPK to effect the registration of
such Shares, and shall execute such documents in connection with such
registration as STPK may reasonably request that are customary of a selling
stockholder in similar situations.

b. STPK shall, notwithstanding any termination of this
Subscription Agreement, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Investor (to the
extent a seller under the Registration Statement), the officers, directors,
trustees, agents, partners, members, managers, stockholders, affiliates,
employees and investment advisers of each of them, each person who controls
Investor (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, trustees, agents,
partners, members, managers, stockholders, affiliates, employees and
investment advisers of each such controlling person, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable costs
of preparation and investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), as incurred, that arise out of or are based
upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement, any prospectus included in the Registration
Statement or any form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to
any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any
prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing
to STPK by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use therein.

  



  

c. Investor shall, severally and not jointly with any other
Investor, indemnify and hold harmless STPK, its directors, officers, agents
and employees, each person who controls STPK (within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling persons, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as
incurred, arising out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, or any form of prospectus,
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or
arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of any prospectus, or any form of prospectus or supplement
thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statements
or omissions are based solely upon information regarding Investor furnished
in writing to STPK by Investor expressly for use therein. In no event shall
the liability of Investor be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
net proceeds received by Investor upon the sale of the Shares giving rise
to such indemnification obligation. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Investor's
indemnification obligations shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of
any Losses or action if such settlement is effected without the prior written
consent of Investor.

8. _Additional Investor Agreement_

  



  

a. . The Investor hereby agrees that, from the date of this
Subscription Agreement, the Investor, its controlled affiliates, or
any person or entity acting on behalf of Investor or any of its controlled
affiliates or pursuant to any understanding with Investor or any of its
controlled affiliates will not engage in any Short Sales with respect to
securities of STPK prior to the Closing.  "Short Sales" shall include,
without limitation, all "short sales" as defined in Rule 200
promulgated under Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act, and all types of
direct and indirect stock pledges (other than pledges in the ordinary course
of business as part of prime brokerage arrangements). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) nothing herein shall prohibit other entities under common
management with the Investor that have no knowledge of this Subscription
Agreement or of the Investor's participation in the Transaction (including
the Investor's controlled affiliates and/or affiliates) from entering into
any Short Sales; (ii) in the case of an Investor that is a multi-managed
investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate
portions of such Investor's assets and the portfolio managers have no
knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing
other portions of such Investor's assets, this _Section 8_ shall only apply
with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that
made the investment decision to purchase the Subscription Amount covered by
this Subscription Agreement and (iii) nothing herein shall prohibit the
Investor from engaging in derivative transactions of any kind, including, but
not limited to, forward sale contracts, options, puts, calls, swaps
and similar arrangements (including on a total return basis), and sales and
other transactions through U.S broker dealers or non-U.S. broker dealers or
foreign regulated brokers. STPK acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Shares may be pledged by Investor in
connection with a bona fide margin agreement, provided such pledge shall be
(i) pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act or (ii) pursuant to, and in accordance with, a
registration statement that is effective under the Securities Act at the time
of such pledge, and Investor effecting a pledge of Shares shall not be
required to provide STPK with any notice thereof; provided, however, that
neither STPK or their counsel shall be required to take any action (or
refrain from taking any action) in connection with any such pledge, other
than providing any such lender of such margin agreement with an
acknowledgment that the Shares are not subject to any contractual
prohibition on pledging or lock up, the form of such acknowledgment to be
subject to review and comment by STPK in all respects.

  



  

9. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b) upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto and Stem to terminate this Subscription Agreement, (c) STPK's notification to the Investor in writing that it has abandoned its plans to move forward with the Transaction and/or terminates the Investor's obligations with respect to the subscription without the delivery of the Shares having occurred, (d) the Outside Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), if the Closing has not occurred by such date, or (e) if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 3_ of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied or waived, or are not capable of being satisfied, on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement will not be and are not consummated at the Closing; provided that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from any such breach. STPK shall notify the Investor of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination of such agreement.

  



  

10. _Trust Account Waiver_. The Investor acknowledges that STPK is a blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination involving STPK and one or more businesses or assets. The Investor further acknowledges that, as described in STPK's prospectus relating to its initial public offering dated August 17, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov, substantially all of STPK's assets consist of the cash proceeds of STPK's initial public offering and private placement of its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of STPK, its public shareholders and the underwriter of STPK's initial public offering. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to STPK to pay its tax obligations, if any, the cash in the Trust Account may be disbursed only for the purposes set forth in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of STPK entering into this Subscription Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Investor hereby irrevocably waives any and all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind it has or may have in the future, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10 shall be deemed to limit the Investor's right, title, interest or claim to any monies held in the Trust Account by virtue of its record or beneficial ownership of any Shares other than the Shares purchased by it pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, pursuant to a validly exercised redemption right with respect to any such Shares.

11. _Miscellaneous_.

  

  



  

a. Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any rights that may
accrue to the Investor hereunder (other than the Shares acquired
hereunder, if any) may be transferred or assigned; _provided_ that the
Investor may assign its rights and obligations under this
Subscription Agreement to one or more of its affiliates (including other
investment funds or accounts managed or advised by the investment manager who
acts on behalf of the Investor or an affiliate thereof); _provided_ , that no
such assignment shall relieve the Investor of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

b. STPK may request from the Investor such additional information
as STPK may deem necessary to evaluate the eligibility of the Investor to
acquire the Shares, and the Investor shall promptly provide such information
as may reasonably be requested to the extent readily available and to the
extent consistent with its internal policies and procedures; provided, that,
STPK agrees to keep any such information provided by Investor confidential
except (i) as required by the federal securities law or pursuant to other
routine proceedings of regulatory authorities or (ii) to the extent such
disclosure is required by law, at the request of the staff of the SEC or
regulatory agency or under the regulations of any national securities exchange
on which STPK's securities are listed for trading. The Investor acknowledges
and agrees that if it does not provide STPK with such requested
information, STPK may not be able to register the Investor\'s Shares for
resale pursuant to Section 7 hereof. The Investor hereby agrees that its
identity and the Subscription Agreement, as well as the nature of the
Investor's obligations hereunder, may be disclosed in any public announcement
or disclosure required by the SEC and in any registration statement, proxy
statement, consent solicitation statement or any other SEC filing to be filed
by STPK in connection with the issuance of shares contemplated by
this Subscription Agreement and/or the Transaction.

  



  

c. The Investor acknowledges that the STPK, the Company (following
the Closing), Stem (following the Closing), the Placement Agents and others
will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations
and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, the Investor agrees to promptly notify STPK and the Placement Agents
if any of the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 6_ above are no longer accurate in any
material respect (other than those acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations and warranties qualified by materiality, in which
case the Investor shall notify STPK and the Placement Agents if they are no
longer accurate in all respects). The Investor agrees that each purchase by
the Investor of Shares from STPK will constitute a reaffirmation of
the acknowledgments, understandings, agreements, representations and
warranties herein (as modified by any such notice) by the Investor as of the
time of such purchase. The Investor further acknowledges and agrees that Stem
and the Placement Agent shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this
Subscription Agreement of which Stem and the Placement Agent are each
an express third party beneficiary on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

  



  

d. The Company, Stem, STPK and the Placement Agents are each
entitled to rely upon this Subscription Agreement and each is
irrevocably authorized to produce this Subscription Agreement or a copy
hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceeding or
official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.

  



  

e. All of the agreements, representations and warranties made by
each party hereto in this Subscription Agreement shall survive the Closing.

  



  

f. This Subscription Agreement may not be modified, waived or
terminated (other than pursuant to the terms of _Section 9_ above) except by
an instrument in writing, signed by each of the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no modification or waiver by STPK of the provisions of this
Subscription Agreement shall be effective without the prior written consent
of Stem (other than modifications or waivers that are solely ministerial in
nature or otherwise immaterial and do not affect any economic or any other
material term of this Subscription Agreement). No failure or delay of either
party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power,
or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, _Section 6_, _Section 11(c)_, _Section 11(d),_ this
_Section 11(f)_ and _Section 12 _may not be modified, waived or terminated
in a manner that is material and adverse to the Placement Agents without the
written consent of the Placement Agents.

g. This Subscription Agreement (including the schedule hereto)

oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as
set forth in _Section 9(b)_, _Section 11(c)_, _Section 11(d)_, _Section
11(f)_ and this _Section 11(g)_ with respect to the persons specifically
referenced therein, this Subscription Agreement shall not confer any rights

respective successor and assigns, and the parties hereto acknowledge that
such persons so referenced are third party beneficiaries of this Subscription
Agreement with right of enforcement for the purposes of, and to the extent
of, the rights granted to them, if any, pursuant to the

representations, warranties, covenants and acknowledgments contained herein
shall be deemed to be made by, and be binding upon, such heirs,
executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted
assigns.

  



  

i. If any provision of this Subscription Agreement shall be
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Subscription Agreement shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby and shall continue in full force and effect.

  



  

j. This Subscription Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail or in .pdf) and by
different parties in separate counterparts, with the same effect as if all
parties hereto had signed the same document. All counterparts so executed and
delivered shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

  



  

k. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Subscription Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Subscription Agreement, without
posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Subscription Agreement,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
