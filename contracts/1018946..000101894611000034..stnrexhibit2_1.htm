The Stockholders' Representative shall delineate all variations from the calculations under <U>Section 2.7(b)</U> in writing in reasonable detail.  If at the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, the Stockholders' Representative shall not have proposed any such adjustments, Parent's calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital shall constitute the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Parent's calculation of Closing Cash shall constitute Final Closing Cash and Parent's calculation of Minimum Closing Cash shall constitute Final Minimum Closing Cash.  All adjustments proposed by the Stockholders' Representative shall be set out in reasonable detail in a written statement delivered to Parent (the <B>"<I><U>Adjustment Statement</I></U>"</B>) and shall be incorporated into the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Final Closing Date Working Capital, Final Closing Cash and Final Minimum Closing Cash, unless Parent objects in writing to such proposed adjustments (the proposed adjustment or adjustments to which Parent objects are referred to herein as the "<B><I><U>Contested Adjustments</I></U>"</B> and Parent's objection notice is referred to herein as the "<B><I><U>Contested Adjustment Notice</I></U>"</B>) within ten (10) days of the Stockholders' Representative's delivery of the Adjustment Statement to Parent.

Parent's Contested Adjustment Notice shall provide reasonably specific and detailed objections to, and Parent's good faith calculations of, the Contested Adjustments.  If Parent timely delivers a Contested Adjustment Notice to the Stockholders' Representative, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve their dispute regarding the Contested Adjustments, but if a final resolution thereof is not obtained within ten (10) Business Days after Parent delivers to the Stockholders' Representative said timely Contested Adjustment Notice, either Parent or the Stockholders' Representative may at any time thereafter retain for the benefit of all the parties hereto PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if unable or unwilling to serve, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm acceptable to both the Stockholders' Representative and Parent (the "<B><I><U>Independent Accountant</B></I></U>") to resolve any remaining disputes concerning the Contested Adjustments.  The Independent Accountant shall be the sole arbiter of all matters, procedural or substantive, as to the Contested Adjustments.  Each of the parties shall execute any retainer agreements and fund one-half of any retainer customarily requested by the Independent Accountant.  If the Independent Accountant is retained, then the Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall each submit to the Independent Accountant in writing not later than fifteen (15) days after the Independent Accountant is retained their respective positions with respect to the Contested Adjustments, together with such supporting documentation as they deem necessary or as the Independent Accountant requests.  The Independent Accountant shall not review or take into account any information that is not submitted in writing on a timely basis in accordance with the deadlines in this <U>Section 2.7</U> and shall only make a determination as to the Contested Adjustments (and only within the ranges submitted by the parties) and not any other items on the Closing Date Balance Sheet or affecting the Final Closing Date Working Capital, Final Closing Cash or Final Minimum Closing Cash.  The Independent Accountant shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving the positions of both the Stockholders' Representative and Parent and all supplementary supporting documentation requested by the Independent Accountant, but in any event no later than forty-five (45) days after being retained, render its decision as to the Contested Adjustments, which decision shall be deemed an arbitral award that is final and binding on, and nonappealable by, the Stockholders' Representative and Parent.  In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by Parent or the Stockholders' Representative, or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Parent or the Stockholders' Representative.  The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the party whose estimate of the Contested Adjustments in the aggregate is furthest from the Independent Accountant's calculation of the Contested Adjustments in the aggregate based on the relative absolute values of such estimates and calculation.  The decision of the Independent Accountant shall include a certificate of the Independent Accountant setting forth the Final Closing Date Working Capital calculation, the Final Closing Cash calculation and the Final Minimum Closing Cash calculation (the "<B><I><U>Settlement Certificate</B></I></U>").  Each of the "Final Closing Date Working Capital", "Final Closing Cash" and "Final Minimum Closing Cash" shall be deemed to include all proposed adjustments not disputed by Parent and those adjustments accepted or made by the Independent Accountant in resolving the Contested Adjustments.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc306225483"><B><U>Company Disclosure Letter</U>.</B>  A disclosure in any particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or otherwise in this Agreement will be deemed adequate to disclose another exception to a representation or warranty made herein if the disclosure identifies the exception with reasonable particularity so that any exception to any such other representation or warranty is readily apparent.  The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent significance.  If any party hereto has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.  The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.  In addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter.  Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.</A></LI></P>

The parties hereto waive the application of any Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.</A></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc306225486"><B><U>Specific Enforcement</U>.  </B> The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event.  Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, subject to <U>Section 7.6</U>, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach.  Each party further agrees that no party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this <U>Section 10.16</U>, and each party hereto (a) irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and (b) agrees to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other party or parties in obtaining such equitable relief. Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.</A> </LI></P></OL>
