Time (other than (x) shares of Common Stock, if any, held in the treasury of
the Company, which treasury shares shall be canceled as part of the Merger,
(y) shares of Common Stock, if any, owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, which shares shall be converted into that number of
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation as the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Subsidiary
bore to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (z) shares (each, a "Dissenting Share" and,
together, the "Dissenting Shares") of Common Stock held by Persons who object
to the Merger and comply with the provisions of the DGCL concerning the rights
of holders of Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of
their shares of Common Stock, which shares described in clauses (x), (y) and
(z) shall not constitute "Common Shares" hereunder), shall thereupon be

option to purchase shares of Common Stock (an "Option") shall, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time terminate and be forfeited for no

$0.01 per share, of


 

---

|

- 16-

| 

 



Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c)Subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 3.4, the "Merger
Consideration" shall consist of Two Hundred Thirty Million Dollars
($230,000,000) in cash (the "Enterprise Value"), plus (i) the Estimated Net

Debt Amount, plus (iii) the Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount, less (iv) the
amount of Holder Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to the Holder
Representative at Closing in accordance with Section 3.5, and less (v) the

(d)The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the Holders as set forth

receive in respect of the Common Shares held by such Holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time a portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (i) the

transfer of immediately available funds, an amount (the "Funding Amount")

number of Dissenting Shares and (B) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share
(determined before giving effect to the adjustments provided for in Section
3.4), minus (iii) the Escrow Amount, minus (iv) any amounts subtracted
pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below; provided that Acquiror will promptly
thereafter pay to the Exchange Agent any amounts by which the Funding Amount
increases due to any Dissenting Shares becoming Common Shares in accordance
with Section 3.10 (which amounts shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be
payable from the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds). In the event that any
holder of Dissenting Shares is entitled, pursuant to a final order and
judgment in any appraisal action regarding Dissenting Shares under the DGCL
that is no longer subject to further appeal or review whether by affirmance or
expiration of any possible appeal or review, writ of certiorari, by leave,
lapse of time or otherwise, to receive consideration that is greater in amount
than the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share for any such Dissenting Shares
that such holder would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement, then (i) an amount equal to the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share
for any such Dissenting Shares shall be payable to such holder by Acquiror
(which amount shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be payable from the
Special Indemnification Escrow Funds) and (ii) the excess of such
consideration over the amount equal to the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share
for any such Dissenting Shares shall be payable from the Special
Indemnification Escrow Funds.

the provisions of Section 3.4) such portion of the Merger Consideration to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(d) in respect of such

such Common Shares to Acquiror at or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall pay the amount which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(d),
at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds, directly to
such Holder, and in such case the Funding Amount shall be reduced by such
amount. Pending such surrender and exchange of a Holder's Certificate(s), a
Holder's Certificate(s) shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence such
Holder's right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration into which
such Common Shares shall have been converted by the Merger. All Merger
Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of Certificates, and from and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,

Working Capital"), (ii) the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount (the "Estimated
Closing Date Funded Debt Amount"), (iii) the Closing Date Cash Amount (the
"Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount"); and the Closing Date Outstanding
Company Expenses (the "Estimated Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses")
and (b) the Company's calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount.

3.4Adjustment Amount.

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within seventy-five (75) calendar days thereof, Acquiror shall prepare
and deliver to the Holder Representative a calculation of (i) the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, (iii) the
Closing Date Cash Amount and (iv) the Closing Date Outstanding Company
Expenses (the "Post-Closing Statement"). If Acquiror's calculation of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the
Closing Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses
results in a calculation of the Adjustment Amount that is a positive number,
(i) Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall immediately deliver joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to
each Holder an amount in cash equal to (A) the Adjustment Escrow Funds,
multiplied by (B) such Holder's Escrow Percentage, and (ii) Acquiror shall pay
to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (x) such Holder's Escrow Percentage,
multiplied by (y) Acquiror's calculation of the Adjustment Amount. If
Acquiror's calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses results in a calculation of the Adjustment

|

| 

 



Amount that is a negative number and the absolute value of such calculation of
the Adjustment Amount is less than the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Funds,
Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall immediately deliver joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to each
Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess of the entire Adjustment
Escrow Funds over Acquiror's calculation of the Adjustment Amount, multiplied
by (ii) such Holder's Escrow Percentage (it being understood and agreed that
such payment shall not limit the rights of the Holder Representative pursuant
to this Section 3.4). Following the Closing, Acquiror shall provide the Holder
Representative and its representatives access to the records, properties and
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing
Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses, and shall
cause the personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to cooperate
with the Holder Representative in connection with its review of the Post-
Closing Statement and such calculations.

(b)If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the
Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses,
it shall notify Acquiror of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within seventy-five
(75) calendar days after its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement. In the
event that the Holder Representative does not provide such a notice of
disagreement within such seventy-five (75) day period, the Holder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Post-Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date
Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date
Outstanding Company Expenses delivered by Acquiror, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such
notice of disagreement is timely provided, Acquiror and the Holder
Representative shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount
and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses. If, at the end of such
period, they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Grant Thornton LLP
(or such other independent accounting or financial consulting firm of
recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Acquiror and the
Holder Representative) (the "Independent Accountant") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. Each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall
promptly provide their assertions regarding the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount
and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and, to the extent
relevant thereto, the Post-Closing Statement, in writing to the Independent
Accountant and to each other. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed
to render its determination with respect to such disagreements (and provide in
reasonable detail the basis for each such determination) as soon as reasonably
practicable (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than forty-
five (45) days following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the
Independent Accountant). The Independent Accountant shall base its
determination solely on (i) the written submissions of the parties and shall
not conduct an independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the
Closing Date Cash Amount and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses
require adjustment (only with respect to the


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 19-

| 

 



remaining disagreements submitted to the Independent Accountant) in order to
be determined in accordance with Section 3.4(a) (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in Section 3.4(a)), and, with respect to each disputed
item, the Independent Accountant's determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either Acquiror or the Holder Representative, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts presented in
Acquiror's calculation of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 3.4(a) or
in the Holder Representative's written notice of disagreement of such
calculation pursuant to this Section 3.4(b). The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
and no party shall seek further recourse to any Governmental Authority other
than to enforce the determination of the Independent Accountant. The parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 3.4 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If Acquiror
fails promptly to pay any Adjustment Amount that may be payable to the Holders
in accordance with this Section 3.4, or if either party fails to give the
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section
3.4 and, in order to obtain such payment or delivery of the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, a party commences an Action that results in
a judgment against the other party for such Adjustment Amount or for the
delivery of the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, the losing
party shall pay to the prevailing party (or deliver the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to pay), together with such
Adjustment Amount, in accordance with Section 3.4(a) and Section 3.4(d),
interest on such Adjustment Amount from the date Acquiror delivers to the
Holder Representative its calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and the
Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses at a rate per annum equal to the
prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect
on the date hereof. In addition the prevailing party shall be entitled to any
fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the prevailing
party in connection with any such Action. The date on which the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date
Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses are finally
determined in accordance with this Section 3.4(b) is hereinafter referred to
as the "Determination Date." All fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent
Accountant hereunder shall be borne one-half (50%) by Acquiror, on the one
hand, and one-half (50%) by the Holder Representative, first as a Holder
Allocable Expense and then, to the extent in excess of the amount of Holder
Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to the Holder Representative at Closing in
accordance with Section 3.5, from the Adjustment Escrow Funds (and, if
applicable pursuant to the third sentence of Section 3.4(d), the
Indemnification Escrow Funds), on the other hand.

(c)If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment
Amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.4(a) and Section 3.4(d).

(d)On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay a portion of the Merger
Consideration equal to the Escrow Amount to Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as escrow agent of the parties hereto (the "Escrow Agent"), to be
held in escrow; provided that Acquiror will promptly thereafter pay to the
Escrow Agent any amounts by which the Escrow


 

---

| 

 



Amount increases due to any Dissenting Shares becoming Common Shares in
accordance with Section 3.10. The Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the
form attached hereto as Annex B (the "Escrow Agreement"). If the Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following the Determination Date,
(x) Acquiror shall within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date pay
to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) such Holder's Escrow Percentage,
multiplied by (ii) the Adjustment Amount, less any portion of the Adjustment
Amount previously paid by Acquiror to such Holder pursuant to Section 3.4(a),
and (y) Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall immediately deliver joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to
each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the Adjustment Escrow Funds,
multiplied by (ii) such Holder's Escrow Percentage, less any portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds previously paid by the Escrow Agent to such Holder
pursuant to Section 3.4(a). If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the
absolute value of such amount, the "Deficit Amount"), then, promptly following
the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (x) Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall
immediately deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to Acquiror an amount of Adjustment Escrow Funds, and
if such Adjustment Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy the Deficit
Amount, from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, equal to the Deficit Amount
(subject to the last sentence of this Section 3.4(d)), and (y) if any of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds remain after such payment to Acquiror, the Escrow
Agent shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash equal to (i) the balance of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds, multiplied by (ii) such Holder's Escrow
Percentage. Upon determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c), each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse the Adjustment Escrow Funds (and, if applicable
pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Indemnification Escrow Funds) in
accordance with this Section 3.4(d). In no event shall any Holder have any
liability under this Section 3.4 in excess of such Holder's Escrow Percentage
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds and the Indemnification Escrow Funds. In no
event shall Acquiror be entitled to payment pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) of
any amount in excess of the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Funds and the
Indemnification Escrow Funds.

(e)Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to treat for
all Tax purposes any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3.4 as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

3.5Holder Allocable Expenses. On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay to the
Holder Representative a cash amount equal to $500,000 (the "Holder Allocable
Expenses"), which shall be used by the Holder Representative in its capacity
as such. Whether or not paid on or prior to the Closing Date, no amount shall
be included on the Post-Closing Statement, the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital or the Closing Date Net Working Capital, in each case, with
respect to liabilities for the Holder Allocable Expenses.

3.6Outstanding Company Expenses. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide to Acquiror a written report setting forth a list of the following
fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions

contemplated hereby and thereby, solely to the extent such fees and expenses
are incurred through the Closing and unpaid as of 11:59 p.m. California time
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, whether accrued for or not:
(a) the fees and disbursements of outside counsel to the Company incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) the fees
and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants and experts employed
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Exchange Agent
which shall be payable upon the engagement of the Exchange Agent prior to
Closing, (c) the Change in Control Payments, if any, (d) any and all amounts
due from the Company or any Company Subsidiary to Oliver Wyman, if any, and
(e) the premium and associated fees in connection with the "tail" policy
providing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage pursuant to
Section 7.2(b) (the fees and expenses in the foregoing clauses (a) through
(e), collectively, the "Outstanding Company Expenses"). Immediately prior to
the Effective Time and concurrently with the payment to the Exchange Agent of
the Funding Amount, Acquiror shall pay to such third-parties as are directed
by the Holder Representative with written evidence of the total amount due
such third party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to the Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be included on the
Post-Closing Statement, the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital or the
Closing Date Net Working Capital, in each case, with respect to liabilities
for the Outstanding Company Expenses paid in accordance with this Section 3.6.
For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts payable in connection with the
repayment of the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount shall be included in the
Outstanding Company Expenses.

3.7Repayment of Funded Debt. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to the Acquiror a payoff letter from each lender of the Existing Credit
Facilities (and any other indebtedness for borrowed money to banks or
financial institutions, if any), which payoff letter shall state the amount of
the applicable Funded Debt owed to such lender and that, if such amount is
paid to such lender on the Closing Date (or thereafter, if any applicable per
diem amounts are paid), such lender will release any and all Liens that it may
have with respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their assets.
At the Closing, the Acquiror shall pay in full (on behalf of the Company), or
shall cause the Company to pay in full (and shall provide sufficient funds to
the Company to enable it to make such payments), an amount equal to the Funded
Debt as set forth in such payoff letters for the Closing Date by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in the amounts and to the lenders identified
such payoff letters.

3.8Exchange Agent. Promptly following the date which is one year after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to
Acquiror all cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each Holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) may surrender such Certificate to Acquiror and
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive
in consideration therefor, and Acquiror shall promptly pay, the portion of the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this Article III, without any interest thereon.

3.9Lost Certificate. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as

| 

 



Acquiror may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with
this Article III.

3.10Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article III, the Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to
such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL to the extent that such
rights were not waived by such holders by execution of the Stockholders
Agreement. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who is entitled to exercise the
rights granted by Section 262 of the DGCL pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence and who becomes entitled to payment for such shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; provided, however, that (i)
if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish such
holder's entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL, or (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively
withdrawn such holder's demand for appraisal of such shares or lost such
holder's right to appraisal and payment for such holder's shares under Section
262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
shares and each such share shall not constitute a Dissenting Share and shall
be treated as if it had been a Common Share immediately prior to the Effective
Time and converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article III, without any
interest thereon.

3.11Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, any consideration payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be reduced by any Tax withholding required by Law,
and any amount so withheld in compliance with applicable Law will be treated
for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Person with respect to
which the withholding was made. Any Person that expects to so withhold (or
expects its agent to so withhold) any such Tax (other than any such Tax that
is imposed on consideration that is properly treated as compensation for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes) will provide notice of the expected withholding
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the withholding to the Person with
respect to which the withholding is to be made (and the notice will include
the legal authority and the calculation method for the expected withholding),
and the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to cooperate to minimize
the amount of the withholding.

3.12RWI Policy. Acquiror shall pay the premium and all other costs required
for issuance of the RWI Policy at Closing. The RWI Policy shall include a
provision whereby insurer expressly waives, and agrees not to pursue, directly
or indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Holder Representative or any
Holder with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder (except for
intentional fraud in connection with the transaction by that Holder or Holder
Representative).

all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this

Guarantor, Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror (including Merger Sub) is a
party or by which Parent Guarantor, Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror
(including Merger Sub) may be bound, or terminate or result in the termination
of any such agreement, indenture or instrument, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent Guarantor, Acquiror or

under this Agreement.

Acquiror or Merger Sub, investigations, pending before or by any Governmental

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of

--- 
| | 

|

- 41-

perform its obligations under this Agreement. There is no unsatisfied judgment
or any open injunction binding upon Parent Guarantor, Acquiror or Merger Sub
which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Parent Guarantor, Acquiror or Merger Sub to enter into and perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (a)
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the Ley Federal de Competencia
Economica, if applicable, and (b) as otherwise disclosed on Schedule 5.5.

Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses required to be
paid by or on behalf of Acquiror or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror understands and
acknowledges that the obligations of Acquiror and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not in any way contingent upon
or otherwise subject to Acquiror's or Merger Sub's consummation of any
financing arrangement, Acquiror's or Merger Sub's obtaining of any financing
or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to
Acquiror or Merger Sub.

5.7Brokers' Fees. Except fees described on Schedule 5.7 (which fees shall be
the sole responsibility of Acquiror), no broker, finder, investment banker or

respective Affiliates.

5.8Solvency; Surviving Corporation After the Merger. None of Acquiror or
Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Article IV are true and correct in all material respects,
and after giving effect to the Merger, at and immediately after the Effective
Time, each of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation and each of the Company
Subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets
will not be less than the sum of its debts and that the present fair saleable
value of its assets will not be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its recourse debts as they mature or become due), (b)

the fact that he or she is or was, prior to the Closing Date, a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at
the request of the Company, whether such claim arises before or after the

or former director of the Company or its Subsidiaries by virtue of such
current or former director's service as a partner or employee of any
investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (any
such current or former director, a "Sponsor Director") shall be secondary to

the payment of all Damages with respect to Sponsor Directors which are
addressed by this Section 7.2 and (C) shall not make any claim for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any
other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with respect to any
matter addressed by this Section 7.2. Acquiror shall assume, and be jointly
and severally liable for, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
honor, each of the covenants in this Section 7.2.

(b)At the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall purchase,
with the premium and associated fees paid included as an Outstanding Company
Expense, a "tail" policy providing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, for
the benefit of those Persons who are covered by the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as of the
Closing Date with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing.
Acquiror shall not take, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries not to take, any action to amend or terminate such policy and
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain in effect
such policy for the term thereof; provided, however, that, if any claim is
asserted or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be
maintained under this Section 7.2 shall be continued by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, in respect of such claim until the final
disposition thereof.

(c)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section
7.2.

7.3Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records. From and after the Closing
and to the extent consistent with all applicable Laws, Acquiror will make or
cause to be made available to the Holder Representative all books, records and
documents of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries (and the
assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 48-

| 

 



documents) during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary for
(i) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Action (other than any Action, suit or proceeding
against Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, that does not relate to any matter indemnifiable by any
of the Holders pursuant to Article XII for which the Holder Representative is
entitled to control the defense thereof), (ii) preparing reports to
stockholders and Governmental Authorities or (iii) such other purposes for
which access to such documents is believed by the Holder Representative to be
reasonably necessary, including preparing and delivering any accounting or
other statement provided for under this Agreement or otherwise; provided,
however, that access to such books, records, documents and employees will not
materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries incurred in connection therewith will be paid by the
Holder Representative out of the Holder Allocable Expenses. Acquiror will
cause the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries to maintain and
preserve all such books, records and other documents for any applicable
statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended and, in
each case, shall offer to transfer such records to the Holder Representative
at the end of any such period.

7.4Special Property Tax Matter. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve the Special Property Tax Matter in a way that results in the lowest
Tax liability arising out of the Special Property Tax Matter to the Surviving
Corporation as is reasonably practicable. For so long as the Special Property
Tax Matter remains a Pending Claim, the last sentence of Section 8.3(c) shall
apply to such Pending Claim.

ARTICLE VIII.

JOINT COVENANTS

8.1Support of Transaction. Without limiting any covenant contained in Article
VI or Article VII, including the obligations of the Company, Acquiror and
Merger Sub with respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and
applications described in Section 6.3 and Section 7.1, which obligations shall
control to the extent of any conflict with the succeeding provisions of this
Section 8.1, the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub shall each, and shall each
cause their respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use commercially reasonable
efforts to assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to
supplement such information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as
promptly as practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to
be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals
of third-parties that any of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, or their
respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (c) take such other action as
may reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to
satisfy the conditions of Article IX or otherwise to comply with this
Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or their Affiliates be obligated to bear any
expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining
any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of any
Contract to which the Company or any


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 49-

| 

 



of the Company Subsidiaries is a party in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.2Escrow Agreement. Each of the Company, the Holder Representative, Acquiror
and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to one another the Escrow Agreement
at the Closing.

8.3Tax Matters.

(a)Acquiror agrees to file a consolidated federal Income Tax Return with the
Company starting on the day following the Closing Date and to cause the
Company to become a member of the affiliated group of corporations of which
Acquiror is the common parent or of which Acquiror is a member on the day
following the Closing Date. For any Tax Return with respect to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Tax Period that is
required by Law to be filed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extension of the
time for filing), Acquiror agrees that (i) the Tax Return will be prepared and
timely filed in a manner consistent with the most recent past practice of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (except as otherwise required by Law),
(ii) the Tax Return will be delivered to the Holder Representative, for the
Holder Representative's review, a reasonable period of time before the filing
date (and no later than twenty (20) Business Days before the filing date if
the Tax Return is an Income Tax Return), and (iii) the Acquiror will consider
in good faith any revision reasonably requested in writing by the Holder
Representative and Acquiror and the Holder Representative will cooperate in
good faith to resolve any disagreements relating to such Tax Return. In the
event that Acquiror and the Holder Representative cannot resolve any such
disagreement, the matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant to
resolve, in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 3.4; provided
that Acquiror shall be entitled to file any such Tax Return prior to
resolution by the Independent Accountant in order to avoid the late filing of
such Tax Return, in which case an amended Tax Return shall be filed, if
necessary to reflect the Independent Accountant's determination and an
adjustment shall be made to any amount paid or required to be paid pursuant to
Section 12.2(a), if necessary, to reflect such determination. Acquiror will,
at its expense, timely file all Tax Returns and other documentation necessary
with respect to all Transfer Taxes and timely pay all taxes shown as due on
such tax returns and, to the extent required by Law, the parties hereto will
cooperate in the execution of such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(b)Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Tax Period and the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention of and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to Tax matters and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information.

(c)Acquiror shall promptly notify the Holder Representative in writing upon
receipt by any Acquiror Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of any
written notice from a taxing authority of an Action with respect to Taxes of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim relating to Taxes for which the


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 50-

| 

 



Acquiror Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under Section
12.2(a) ("Tax Contest Claim"). Such notice shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant Governmental
Authority. Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim (and provide such powers of
attorney as may be necessary). Notwithstanding Section 12.3(b), the Holder
Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
Claim relating to any Tax period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date so
long as there are remaining Indemnification Escrow Funds (any such claim, a
"Holder Representative's Tax Contest Claim"); provided that, if the resolution
or settlement of such Holder Representative's Tax Contest Claim would have an
adverse effect on the Acquiror Indemnified Parties in a Post-Closing Tax
Period, the Holder Representative shall keep Acquiror informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of such Holder Representative's Tax Contest
Claim, Acquiror shall be entitled at its expense to participate in such Holder
Representative's Tax Contest Claim, and the Holder Representative shall not
compromise or settle any such Holder Representative's Tax Contest Claim
without obtaining Acquiror's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding Section
12.3(b), Acquiror shall have the right to control the conduct of any Holder
Representative's Tax Contest Claim that the Holder Representative does not
elect to control and any Tax Contest Claim that is not a Holder
Representative's Tax Contest Claim; provided that Acquiror shall keep the
Holder Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects
of such Tax Contest Claim, the Holder Representative shall be entitled to
participate in such Tax Contest Claim, and Acquiror shall not compromise or
settle any such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Holder
Representative's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d)After the Closing and for so long as any funds remain in the
Indemnification Escrow Account, except as required by Law or with the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Acquiror agrees not to, and agrees to cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates) not
to, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (i) file any amended Tax
Return, (ii) make or change any Tax election, (iii) adopt or change any Tax
accounting method, (iv) change any annual Tax accounting period, (v) agree to
extend any statute of limitations for Taxes, (vi) initiate any voluntary
disclosure with respect to Taxes, or (vii) take any other similar action
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns. Acquiror agrees not to, and agrees to cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates) not
to, (A) make any election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby unless Acquiror indemnifies the Holders for
any additional Taxes resulting from such an election or elections; and
provided, that no Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make a claim
for indemnification for or with respect to, and Holders shall have no
liability to any Acquired Indemnified Party for or with respect to, any Taxes
arising from any such election, pursuant to Section 12.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement, or (B) take any action or enter into any
transaction on the Closing Date after the Closing other than in the ordinary
course of business or as explicitly contemplated hereby.

(e)To the extent permitted under applicable Law and to the extent necessary to
cause such effect, each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to, elect for all


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 51-

| 

 



Tax purposes to end on the Closing Date (at the end of the Closing Date) all
taxable periods of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries beginning on or
before the Closing Date. The amount of any Income Tax or any other Tax that is
not a property Tax or similar ad valorem Tax or franchise tax for which no
short period return is allowed for the Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Straddle
Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (and for the foregoing purpose, (i)
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Company or any the Company Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest will
be deemed to terminate at such time and (ii) no election for ratable
allocation will be made under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law)). The amount of
any property Tax or similar ad valorem Tax or franchise tax for which no short
period return is allowed of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Straddle Tax Period will be deemed to be the
amount of the Tax for the Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Tax Period. The
amount of any Tax refund or credit of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Straddle Tax Period will be
determined using the method provided in this Section 8.3(e).

(f)Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to treat for
all Tax purposes all indemnification payments under Article XII as adjustments
to the Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE XI.

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

11.1Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative. The parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
the Holders for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the "Holder
Representative"). The parties have designated


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 55-

| 

 



Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC, as the initial Holder Representative, and
approval of this Agreement by the holders of Common Stock shall constitute
ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder Representative may
resign at any time upon notice to the Company, and the Holder Representative
may be removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "Majority Holders"). In the event that a Holder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall
be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative; provided that, if a Holder Representative has provided the
Company with a notice of resignation and a new Holder Representative has not
been appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders within thirty (30) days
thereafter, the resigning Holder Representative may appoint a new Holder
Representative.

11.2Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability.

(a)The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to
act on behalf of the Holders, except as expressly provided herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have
full power, authority and discretion to (i) expend Holder Allocable Expenses,
and (ii) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the Holders. The
Holder Representative shall have no liability to Acquiror, the Company or any
Holder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as
the Holder Representative. The Holder Representative shall at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders;
provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall not be required to
follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action
in its capacity as the Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative
is holding funds delivered to it under Section 3.5 of this Agreement and/or
has been provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the
Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Holder Representative in responding to such direction or
taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative)
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons. The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from
funds paid to it under Section 3.5 of this Agreement, released from the
Adjustment Escrow Funds, the Indemnification Escrow Funds or the Special
Indemnification Escrow Funds, as applicable, for the benefit of Holders and/or
otherwise received by it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant
to or in connection with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Holder
Representative in such capacity, and shall be entitled to indemnification
against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for
those arising out of the Holder Representative's bad faith or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. In the event that the Holder Allocable Expenses exceed the amount
actually incurred by the Holder Representative in its capacity as such upon
the final


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 56-

| 

 



release of the Indemnification Escrow Funds, such excess amount shall be
distributed to the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent shall pay to each Holder
an amount in cash equal to (i) the balance of such excess, multiplied by (ii)
such Holder's Escrow Percentage, less any applicable withholding.

(b)Any decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Holder
Representative given or made pursuant to this Section 11.2 shall constitute a
decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Holders, and the
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to conclusively rely
upon any representation of the Holder Representative with respect to any such
act, decision, consent, approval or instruction of the Holders. The
appointment and power of attorney made in this Section 11.2 shall to the
fullest extent permitted by Law be deemed an agency coupled with an interest
and all authority conferred hereby shall to the fullest extent permitted by
Law be irrevocable and not be subject to termination by operation of Law,
whether by the death or incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Holder
or the occurrence of any other event or events. Any action taken by the Holder
Representative on behalf of the Holders pursuant to this Agreement shall be as
valid as if any such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other
event had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Holder
Representative, the Surviving Corporation or the Acquiror shall have received
notice of any such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event.

ARTICLE XII.

INDEMNIFICATION

12.1Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each representation
warranty, covenant and obligation contained herein and any certificate related
to any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation will survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect for fifteen (15) months from the
Closing Date (such date, the "Survival Expiration Date"); provided, however,
that any covenant contained in this Agreement that, by its terms, provides for
performance following the Closing Date shall survive until such covenant is
performed. No Indemnification Claim may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement
unless (i) on or before the Survival Expiration Date, such claim is asserted
by proper written notice in accordance with this Article XII, specifying, in
reasonable detail, the basis of the claim and (ii) such claim is made in
respect of Damages specified, in reasonable detail, and incurred prior to the
Survival Expiration Date or, to the extent arising out of an Indemnification
Claim asserted in writing prior to the Survival Expiration Date, such
Indemnification Claim is made in respect of a reasonably estimated amount of
Damages reasonably expected to arise in connection with such claim. No
Indemnification Claim arising from a claim (or an expected claim) by a third-
party may be asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless such third-party has
actually commenced an action and, if the third-party claim is with respect to
Taxes, the Indemnified Party has received a written notice of assessment or
written notice of deficiency, in each case, with respect to the specific
matters of such Indemnification Claim.

12.2Indemnification.

(a)Subject to Section 12.4 and clause (A) of Section 8.3(d), from and after
the Effective Time, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Acquiror
Indemnified Parties") shall be entitled to indemnification (other than in
respect of clause (iv) hereof) solely from the Indemnification Escrow Funds
(and, solely in the case of clause (iv) hereof, solely

|

- 57-

| 

 



from the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds) for any and all Damages to the
extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty the
Company has made in Article IV, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement requiring performance by the Company prior to or
at the Closing or by the Holder Representative after the Closing, (iii) any
Pre-Closing Taxes (except to the extent (A) amounts with respect to such Taxes
were taken into account in the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital or (B) arising from the Special Property Tax Matter), (iv) the Special
Indemnification-Related Claims, or (v) the Special Property Tax Matter.

(b)Subject to Section 12.4, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Holders harmless for any and all Damages to the
extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Acquiror
or Merger Sub has made in Article V, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Acquiror or
Merger Sub prior to or at the Closing or by Acquiror, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing or (iii) any Transfer Taxes.

(c)The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XII shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.

12.3Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a)Upon receipt of any notice of an Action that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this Section 12.3(a) will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give or cause to be given such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this Section 12.3(a) prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

(b)An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and
each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of
such defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 58-

| 

 



with the Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor;
provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not agree to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such
Action without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which must not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement
provide for a complete release of the claims that are the subject of such
Action in favor of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an
Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not
thereafter promptly assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may
conduct the defense of such Action; provided, however, that (A) the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (B) the Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time
the defense of such Action. To the extent the defense of any Action subject to
any Indemnification Claim is assumed by the Holder Representative as the
Indemnitor, at the election of the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such
defense of, and any payment in respect of, any Action, including any
settlement thereof, shall be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds (other
than with respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iv), which
shall be paid solely from the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds), and
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Holder Representative shall
promptly submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds (or
the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds, if applicable) as is reasonably
requested in writing by the Holder Representative to pay such costs and
expenses or other amounts; provided, however, that no amounts will be payable
from the Indemnification Escrow Funds or the Special Indemnification Escrow
Funds (other than, at the election of the Holder Representative, costs and
expenses of the Holder Representative as Indemnitor), unless the Indemnified
Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 12.3(b) to the contrary, (x) the Holder
Representative, on behalf of the Holders, solely in its capacity as
Indemnitor, shall assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the Special
Indemnification-Related Claims with counsel of its own choice and shall settle
or compromise the Special Indemnification-Related Claims in its sole
discretion (provided that the terms of such settlement or compromise shall
provide for a complete release of the Special Indemnification-Related Claims
in favor of the Company), and (y) any Acquiror Indemnified Party, as
applicable, shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such defense
(including the making of any related claims, counterclaim or cross complaint
against any Person in connection with the Special Indemnification-Related
Claims) and/or the settlement of the Special Indemnification-Related Claims by
the Holder Representative.

(c)At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.

12.4Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party makes under
this Article XII will be limited as follows:


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 59-

| 

 



(a)Indemnification Cap. Other than with respect to indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.2(a)(iv), the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article XII will, subject to the immediately following sentence, not exceed
the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The aggregate amount of Damages for which
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 12.2(a)(v) will not exceed the lesser of (A) the Indemnification
Escrow Funds and (B) an amount equal in the aggregate to $500,000. The
aggregate amount of Damages for which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iv) will not exceed
the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Indemnification Escrow Amount
then remaining in escrow shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of
payment of any Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 12.2(a) (other than
with respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iv)). The Special
Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow shall serve as the sole
and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification Claim pursuant to
Section 12.2(a)(iv).

(b)Claims Basket. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of
all Damages incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for which the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 12.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for breaches of Fundamental
Representations) exceeds $2,300,000 (the "Basket Amount"), and once the
aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket Amount, the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification for such Damages
to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket Amount. The Basket Amount shall
not apply to any indemnification claims under Section 12.2(a)(ii), Section
12.2(a)(iii), Section 12.2(a)(iv) or Section 12.2(a)(v) or for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations under Section 12.2(a)(i).

(c)Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries. All
Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XII shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds (but not including any possible recovery under the RWI
Policy), indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which
any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Damages incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
may be entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-
party recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving
rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XII, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are obtained, received or
realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant
Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification
payment.

(d)Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article XII, at the election of the Indemnitor, such
Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for
recovery against third

|

- 60-

| 

 



Persons as to such Damages, whether by insurance coverage, contribution
claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e)Calculation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or an
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining
the amount of Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in
any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", or "in all material respects" or any similar term
or phrase will be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that
for the purposes of determining liability under this Article XII, the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will
be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) the term "Material Permit"
or when used as an adjective in any definition set forth in Section 1.1 and
(ii) any representation or warranty set forth in (A) the last sentence of
Section 4.7; (B) Section 4.11(a)(viii), (xiii) and (xvi); (C) the first
sentence of Section 4.12(a); (D) Section 4.18(f); (E) Section 4.19(a); (F) the
first sentence of Section 4.21(a); (G) Section 4.21(f); (H) the first sentence
of Section 4.22; and (I) the second sentence of Section 4.23.

(f)Damages Reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or Included in Merger
Consideration. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation
accrued or reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or (ii) in respect of
any liability included in the calculation of the Merger Consideration.

(g)No Duplicate Claims. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified Party or the
Holder Representative, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an
Indemnification Claim, no other Acquiror Indemnified Party or the Holder
Representative, as applicable, may recover the same Damages in respect of a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

(h)Limitations on Tax Indemnification. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified for Damages relating to (i) any Taxes with respect to any Post-
Closing Tax Period other than Taxes arising from a breach of the
representation contained in Section 4.14(i) or (ii) any Taxes attributable to
any breach of any covenant hereunder by Acquiror or its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

12.5Mitigation of Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XII.

12.6Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except for
intentional fraud, claims under this Article XII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Funds (or the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds, as applicable) shall be
the sole source of recovery of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties. The parties
recognize that any further recovery for breaches of representations and
warranties under this Agreement by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be
under the RWI Policy (subject to the terms and conditions thereof). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Acquiror, Merger Sub and each of the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 61-

| 

 



hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against any indemnifying party relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement based upon predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort,
strict liability or any Law or otherwise. All representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the
sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this Article XII. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing:

(a)each of Acquiror and Merger Sub hereby waives any statutory and common law
remedies, including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws,
with respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matters);

(b)after the Closing Date, none of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c)the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article XII
were specifically bargained for between the parties hereto and were taken into
account by the parties hereto in arriving at the Merger Consideration;

(d)the parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement;

(e)the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only
(as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant
to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereto hereby agree
that no party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action (whether in
contract or in tort) for any statements, communications, disclosures, failures
to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement;

(f)the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length
negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that no party
hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that would
justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm's-length transaction; and

(g)for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.4 shall not be considered "remedies" for
purposes of this Section 12.6 and shall not be limited by the terms of this
Section 12.6.

12.7Release of Escrow.

(a)The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the Indemnification Escrow Funds
(if any) shall be released to the Holders in accordance with such Holders'
relative Escrow Percentages on the first Business Day following the Survival
Expiration Date; provided,


 

--- 
| | 

|

- 62-

| 

 



however, that, if any Indemnification Claim shall have been properly asserted
by any Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or
prior to the Survival Expiration Date and remains pending on the Survival
Expiration Date (any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (i) the Indemnification
Escrow Funds released to the Holders in accordance with such Holders' relative
Escrow Percentages shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds then
held by the Escrow Agent, minus the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim and
(ii) any funds that remain in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date in
respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to the Holders entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with such Holders' relative
Escrow Percentages promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of
such Pending Claim. In each case in which this Section 12.7(a) provides for
the release of Indemnification Escrow Funds, each of Acquiror and the Holder
Representative shall promptly submit joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Indemnification Escrow
Funds in accordance with this Section 12.7(a) and the Escrow Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Special Property Tax Matter shall be, and hereby
is, as of the date hereof, a Pending Claim. Unless the Special Property Tax
Matter shall have been finally resolved, settled or compromised on or prior to
the Survival Expiration Date, the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds to
remain in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date in respect of such
Pending Claim shall be the lesser of (A) the Indemnification Escrow Funds and
(B) $500,000, in each case, minus any amounts previously paid from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds in respect of such Pending Claim.
Notwithstanding, anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, in
the event that the Special Property Tax Matter is finally resolved,
compromised or settled prior to the Closing and any amounts payable in respect
thereof to the County of Tulare are paid prior to the Closing, then (x) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be reduced to an amount equal to
$2,300,000 and (y) the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages in respect of the Special Property Tax Matter
pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(iii) or Section 12.2(a)(v).

(b)The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the Special Indemnification Escrow
Funds (if any) shall be released to the Holders in accordance with such
Holders' relative Escrow Percentages on the first Business Day following the
later of (i) if applicable, the date a final order and judgment in the Action
described in clause (A) of Schedule 1.1(c)(ii) is no longer subject to further
appeal or review whether by affirmance or expiration of any possible appeal or
review, writ of certiorari, by leave, lapse of time or otherwise; (ii) the
deadline for eligible stockholders to demand appraisal for their shares of
Common Stock under the DGCL provided that no eligible stockholders demand
appraisal; (iii) if applicable, the deadline for eligible stockholders who
have demanded appraisal regarding Dissenting Shares to file an appraisal
petition provided that no eligible stockholders file an appraisal petition; or
(iv) if applicable, the date on which a final order and judgment in any
appraisal action regarding Dissenting Shares under the DGCL is no longer
subject to further appeal or review whether by affirmance or expiration of any
possible appeal or review, writ of certiorari, by leave, lapse of time or
otherwise (such latest date, the "Special Indemnification Escrow Release
Date"); provided that, in the event that the action referenced in clause (i)
of this Section 12.7(b) occurs prior to the Closing in compliance with Section
6.1, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Special
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be reduced for all purposes under this
Agreement by eighty percent (80%); provided, further, that, in the event that
both (x) the action referenced in clause (i) of this Section 12.7(b) occurs
prior to the Closing in compliance with Section 6.1 and (y) the event
specified in clause (ii) of this Section 12.7(b) occurs prior to the


 

---

|

- 63-

| 

 



Closing, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Special
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be reduced for all purposes under this
Agreement by one-hundred percent (100%). In each case in which this Section
12.7(b) provides for the release of Special Indemnification Escrow Funds, each
of Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall promptly submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Special Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with this Section
12.7(b) and the Escrow Agreement.

providing information regarding the transaction contemplated hereby or the
contents of this Agreement to any Governmental Authority in connection with
required HSR Act or other filings or in response to information requests by a
Governmental Authority concerning the transactions contemplated herein, in
each case, to the extent otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

13.12Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
parties.

13.13Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. Any Action based upon, arising out
of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in

the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in the case of
claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
any federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the
right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action,
suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 13.13. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

13.14Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.1, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific performance
is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without that right, none of the Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 13.14 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 13.14 and
concurrently pursue the payment of any damages under Section 10.2, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing (and the payment of
any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by or on behalf
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection
with the Company's pursuance of such grant of specific performance, which
Acquiror or Merger Sub shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company (such
payment shall be deemed to have been made prior to 11:59 p.m. California time
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) if the

Company is actually granted specific performance in accordance with this
Section 13.14) and (B) damages under Section 10.2.

13.15Non-Recourse. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to the
extent provided under Section 13.14, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to
the extent provided under Section 13.14, except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (ii) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub under
this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim
based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

13.16Acknowledgement and Waiver.

(a)It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that each of the Company
and the Holder Representative has retained Latham and Watkins LLP ("LandW") to act
as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
that LandW has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of interest or any other
purposes. Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company agree that any attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of
LandW's representation of the Company and the Holder Representative related to
the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all communications among LandW, the
Company the Holders, the Holder Representative and/or their respective
Affiliates related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation
of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all
communications (and materials relating thereto) between the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and LandW related to the preparation for, and negotiation
and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
hereby assigned and transferred to the Holder Representative, (ii) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries hereby release all of their respective rights and
interests to and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries hereby release any right to assert or
waive any privilege related to the communications referenced in this Section
13.16 and acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside with the
Holder Representative.

(b)Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), agrees that, notwithstanding any current, prior or future
representation of the Company by LandW, LandW shall


 

---

|

- 69-

| 

 



be allowed to represent any of the Holders, the Holder Representative or any
of their respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to
Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company that either is existing on the date hereof
or arises in the future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; and each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), hereby waives any conflicts or claim of privilege that
may arise in connection with such representation. Further, each of Acquiror
and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), agrees that, in
the event that a dispute arises after Closing between Acquiror, Merger Sub or
the Company, on the one hand, and any of the Holders (or the Holder
Representative on behalf of the Holders) or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other, LandW may represent such Holders or the Holder
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of such Holders, the Holder Representative or any of
their respective Affiliate may be directly adverse to Acquiror, Merger Sub or
the Company and even though LandW may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

(c)Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with any
Holder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (other
than the Company) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be
owned solely by such Holder, the Holder Representative and any Affiliate of
each such party. Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
LandW.

13.17Parent Guarantee. Parent Guarantor hereby (i) agrees to take any and all
actions necessary to cause Acquiror and Merger Sub to perform all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms (including with respect to the consummation of the Merger,
the payment of the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 10.2) (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations")
and (ii) absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary
obligor and not merely as surety, the full and complete performance by
Acquiror and Merger Sub of the Guaranteed Obligations, and Parent Guarantor
shall be liable for any breach by Acquiror or Merger Sub of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations. This is a guarantee of payment (not of collection) and
performance. The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to
the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Acquiror or Merger Sub becomes
subject to bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, and the failure
of the Company to so file shall not affect Parent Guarantor's obligations
hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason whatsoever (other than in circumstances where Parent Guarantor is not
liable to make such payment), Parent Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations as if such payment had not been
rescinded or returned. Parent Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence,
presentment, demand of performance, demand of payment, filing of any claim,
any right to require any proceeding first against Acquiror or Merger Sub,
protest, notice of any kind and all demands whatsoever and all suretyship
defenses generally in

connection with the performance of its covenants, agreements and obligations
set forth in this Section 13.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
Acquiror or Merger Sub is relieved of all or any portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations by satisfaction thereof on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement or pursuant to any other agreement with the
Company, Parent Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of its corresponding
obligations under this Section 13.17. Parent Guarantor acknowledges that it
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Section
13.17 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
