Dear  Sir:

 

 

**Re: Proposed  Business Combination**

 



 

This  letter sets forth the agreement between Enerplus Resources Fund  ("
**Enerplus** "), EnerMark Inc. (" **EnerMark** "),  Focus Energy Trust ("
**Focus** ") and FET Resources Ltd.  (" **FET Resources** ") with respect to
a proposed transaction (the  " **Transaction** ") to combine Enerplus and
Focus.

 

 

        

**1.**

    |  

**Structure  of the Transaction and Exchange  Ratio**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Pursuant  to the Transaction, holders of trust units (" **Focus Units** ")
of  Focus will receive, for each Focus Unit, 0.425 of a trust unit  ("
**Enerplus Unit** ") of Enerplus. Holders of Class B  limited partnership
units (" **Focus Exchangeable LP Units** ") of  Focus Limited Partnership ("
**Focus LP** ") will not exchange such  securities for Enerplus Units
pursuant to the Transaction, but pursuant to  the  Transaction the Focus
Exchangeable LP Units will be exchangeable for Enerplus  Units, with the
exchange ratio of the Focus Exchangeable LP Units adjusted  for  the 0.425
exchange ratio contemplated in the Transaction in accordance with  the 
terms of the constating documents governing the Focus Exchangeable LP  Units.

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions set forth below, the Transaction will be
carried  out  pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the _Business
Corporations Act_   (Alberta) (the " **ABCA** ").

 

 

        

**2.**

    |  

**Transaction  Agreement**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Enerplus  and Focus, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall negotiate and
enter  into  an agreement (" **Transaction Agreement** ") as soon as
reasonably  practicable and in any event by January 10, 2008 to implement the
Transaction  to  provide for the merger of Enerplus and Focus and the issue
and distribution  of  Enerplus Units to holders of Focus Units (" **Focus
Unitholders** ")  on the basis described in Section 1. Enerplus and Focus
will work  together to achieve mutually agreeable structuring of the
Transaction before  the  execution of the Transaction Agreement, having
regard to relevant securities,  corporate and trust laws and regulatory,
stock exchange, tax and economic  considerations. It is intended that the
Transaction will be  structured to allow Focus Unitholders to receive
Enerplus Units on a  tax-deferred basis for Canadian and United States income
tax purposes, provided  that Enerplus and Focus shall in good faith review
the inclusion in the  structure of the Transaction provisions that would
allow Focus Unitholders  to  alternatively elect to exchange such Focus
Units for Enerplus Units on a  taxable  basis, provided that Enerplus and
EnerMark shall not be obligated to consent  or  agree to any structuring
that could have an adverse effect on its mutual  fund  trust status or level
of its ownership of property that is "taxable Canadian  property" (" **TCP**
") for the purposes of paragraph 132(7)(a) of  the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada).
It is also intended, to the  extent possible and subject to the terms and
conditions below, that the  Transaction will be structured to qualify for the
exemption from registration  provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the _U.S.
Securities Act of 1933_ , as  amended.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

The  Transaction Agreement shall contain, in addition to the
representations,  warranties, covenants, conditions and other terms specified
herein, customary  representations and warranties by each of Enerplus and
Focus in favour of  the  other, and such other customary terms, covenants
and conditions as would  be  normal for a transaction of this nature on the
terms generally proposed  herein.

 

 

If  the parties fail to execute the Transaction Agreement on or before
January  10,  2008, each of Enerplus and Focus shall, subject to applicable
law, be entitled,  but not obligated, to proceed and require the other party
to this agreement  to  proceed with the Transaction pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this  agreement.

 

 

The  parties acknowledge and agree that the execution and delivery by
Enerplus  and  EnerMark of this agreement is conditional upon each of the
directors and  executive officers of FET Resources concurrently having
executed and delivered  to Focus and Enerplus, or having agreed to execute
and deliver to Focus and  Enerplus as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, lock-up  agreements representing not less than 9.5% of the
Focus Units, 58% of the  Focus  Exchangeable LP Units and 15% of the
aggregate voting securities of  Focus.

 

 

        

**3.**

    |  

**Governance**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

On  the Effective Date, the board of directors of EnerMark will add 2
current  directors of FET Resources to the board of directors of EnerMark,
who will  be  Clayton H. Woitas and David P. O\'Brien.

 

 

        

**4.**

    |  

**Employees**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

EnerMark  will, not less than one week prior to the Effective Date, determine
the  employees of Focus and its subsidiaries (" **Focus Employees** ") who 
will either be offered employment with EnerMark or be provided with 
confirmations of employment, as the case may be, (such Focus employees being 
the  " **Continuing Employees** "). The Continuing Employees,  unless their
employment is terminated, shall continue their employment on  the  terms and
conditions comparable, in the aggregate, to the terms and conditions  on
which they are currently employed. In the event that the  employment of any
Focus Employee is not continued as a Continuing Employee  for  reason other
than voluntary resignation, such employee shall be entitled  to the  payment
of a severance payment in an amount to be agreed by the Parties,  acting 
reasonably.

 

 

Enerplus  and Focus acknowledge that the Transaction will result in a "change
of control"  for purposes of the unit award incentive plan (" **UAIP** "),
the  trust unit rights incentive plan (" **TURIP** ") (the UAIP and the 
TURIP are collectively referred to as the " **Focus Incentive  Plans** ") and
the Focus executive employment agreements.

 

 

The  parties agree that upon approval of the Transaction by Focus
Unitholders,  and  prior to the effective date of the Transaction, all
outstanding unit and  right  entitlements under such plans may be amended,
to the extent necessary, to  allow  the payment of all entitlements in cash.
In calculating the cash  entitlement under the UAIP, Focus shall used the
five day volume weighted  average trading price of the Focus Units during the
five trading days ending  on  the second business day immediately prior to
the effective date of the  Transaction (the " **VWAP** ") and, in calculating
the cash  entitlement under the TURIP, Focus shall use the VWAP less the 
exercise

price  (adjusted for the January distribution). In addition, Focus may 
purchase and cancel all of the "out-of-the-money" rights under the TURIP  at
an  amount of not more that $0.01 per right. To the extent that the  holders
do not elect to receive cash under the UAIP, as amended, such unit  shall 
be paid in Focus Units. To the extent that all of the holders of  rights
under the TURIP do not exercise such rights, elect to receive cash  or  sell
to Focus the "out-of-the-money" rights, the TURIP plan shall be amended  such
that holders of rights shall only be entitled receive Enerplus Units  in 
accordance with the ratio set forth in Section 1.

 

 

The  accompanying disclosure letter dated the date hereof and executed by
the  parties  (the " **Disclosure Letter** ") includes a _bona fide_ ,
good  faith estimate by Focus as of December 2, 2007, having regard to the
assumptions  set forth in the Disclosure Letter, of all obligations of Focus
pursuant  to all  employment or consulting services agreements, termination,
severance and  retention plans or policies for severance, termination or
bonus payments  or any  other payments related to any Focus incentive plan
(including the Focus  Incentive Plans), arising out of or in connection with
the Transaction  (collectively, the " **Focus Change of Control  Payments**
").

 

 

The  Focus Change of Control Payments shall be paid in accordance with their
terms  and in any event as soon as is reasonably practicable following the
Effective  Date.

 

 

        

**5.**

    |  

**Focus  Unitholder Approval**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Focus  will call and hold a meeting (" **Focus Meeting** ") of Focus 
Unitholders and the holders of Focus Exchangeable LP Units (" **Focus 
Exchangeable LP Holders** ", and together with the Focus Unitholders, the  "
**Focus Securityholders** ") to consider and approve the  Transaction. Focus
will, with the co-operation of Enerplus, prepare an  information circular and
proxy statement (" **Information  Circular** ") to be mailed to the Focus
Securityholders for the purpose of  the Focus Meeting. At the Focus Meeting,
the Focus Unitholders and  Focus Exchangeable LP Holders shall vote together
as a single class, and  the  approval of the Transaction will be subject to
any other applicable "minority  approval" or other requirements under
applicable laws. Each of the  parties shall provide the other with all
information with respect to itself  as  may be required for inclusion in the
Information Circular and shall indemnify  the other for any misrepresentation
contained in such information.

 

 

        

**6.**

    |  

**Cooperation**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Each  of Enerplus and Focus covenants and agrees to do all acts and things
and  take  all steps required to complete the Transaction. Without limiting
the generality  of the foregoing, each of Enerplus and Focus covenants and
agrees to use  its  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
aggregate value of the  TCP of  Enerplus following completion of the
Transaction is not greater than 7% of  the  aggregate fair market value of
the issued and outstanding Enerplus Units  and to  otherwise cause to be
fulfilled the conditions precedent to the other party's  obligations to
complete the Transaction and to not take any action that would  cause such
conditions not to be fulfilled. Further, and without  restricting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each party shall reasonably  cooperate with
the other party and its tax advisors in structuring the  Transaction in a tax
effective manner (as contemplated in Section 2), and  assist  the other
party and its tax advisors in making such investigations and inquiries  with
respect to such party in that regard, as the other party and its tax 
advisors shall consider necessary, acting reasonably, provided that Focus 
and  FET Resources shall not be obligated to consent or agree to any
structuring  that  has the effect of reducing the consideration to be
received under the  Transaction by any of its securityholders and Enerplus
and EnerMark shall  not be  obligated to consent or agree to any structuring
that has the effect of  increasing the consideration to be paid under the
Transaction or that would  reduce, for

the  purposes of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), the aggregate cost amount
of  assets held directly by Focus to less than $1.1 billion; and (ii) if
the  parties  are unable to implement the Transaction by way of plan of
arrangement, the  parties shall cooperate with each other to implement the
Transaction by way  of a  merger whereby Enerplus would effectively acquire
all or substantially all  of  the assets of Focus within approximately the
same time periods and on economic  terms (including trust unit exchange ratio
and tax treatment contemplated  in  Section 2) having consequences to the
Focus Unitholders that are economically  equivalent to those contemplated by
this agreement (an " **Alternative  Transaction** "), and the parties agree
to support the completion of such  Alternative Transaction in the same manner
as the Transaction and shall  otherwise fulfill their respective covenants
contained in this agreement  in  respect of such Alternative Transaction.

 

 

Enerplus  and Focus shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause
the Effective  Date to occur on or about February 12, 2008 or as soon
thereafter as reasonably  practicable, provided that the Effective Date shall
not occur during the  period  from January 31, 2008 to February 10, 2008
inclusive, and to cause the mailing  of the Information Circular to the Focus
Unitholders (the " **Mailing  Date** ") to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event by  January 22, 2008.

consideration necessary for the Acquisition Proposal are  or are  likely to
be available; (2) (after consultation with its financial  advisor) would, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, result  in a  transaction
financially superior for Focus Unitholders than the  transaction contemplated
by this agreement; and (3) after receiving  the  advice of outside counsel
as reflected in minutes of the Focus  Board, that  the taking of such action
is necessary for the Focus Board in discharge  of  its fiduciary duties

Following  receipt of a Superior Proposal, Focus and FET Resources shall
give  Enerplus, orally and in writing, at least 72 hours advance notice  of
any  decision by the Focus Board to accept, recommend, approve or enter 
into an  agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall 
confirm  that the Focus Board has determined that such Acquisition Proposal 
constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall identify the third party  making the 
Superior Proposal and shall provide a true and complete copy thereof  and 
any amendments thereto. During such 72 hour period, Focus and FET  Resources
agree not to accept, recommend, approve or enter into  any  agreement to
implement such Superior Proposal and not to release  the party  making the
Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and  shall not  withdraw,
redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect  of the

faith  with Enerplus and its financial and legal advisors to make such 
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this agreement and the 
Transaction as would enable Focus and FET Resources to proceed  with the 
Transaction as amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In the  event 
Focus and FET Resources propose to amend this agreement and the  Transaction
to provide the Focus Unitholders with a value per Focus  Unit  equal to or
having a value greater than the value per Focus Unit  provided  in the
Superior Proposal and so advises the Focus Board prior to  the  expiry of
such 72 hour period, the Focus Board shall not accept,  recommend, approve or
enter into any agreement to implement such  Superior  Proposal and shall not
release the party making the Superior Proposal  from  any standstill
provisions and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify  or  change its
recommendation in respect of the  Transaction.

management personnel and shall  furnish promptly to Enerplus and EnerMark all
information concerning their  businesses, properties and personnel as

Focus  is in breach of any of its covenants made in this agreement which 
breach  individually or in the aggregate causes or would reasonably be 
expected to  cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to Focus or
materially  impedes the completion of the Transaction, and Focus fails to
cure  such  breach within five business days after receipt of written
notice  thereof  from Enerplus (except that no cure period shall be provided
for  a breach  which by its nature cannot be cured and, in no event, shall
any  cure  period extend beyond the Outside Date);  or

contained  therein) which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or 
would  reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with 
respect to  Focus or materially impedes the completion of the Transaction,

receipt  of  written notice thereof from Enerplus (except that no cure

(each  of the above being a " **Enerplus Damages Event** "), then in the 
event of the termination of this agreement pursuant to Section 16, Focus 
shall pay to Enerplus $48 million as liquidated damages in immediately 
available funds to an account designated by Enerplus within one business 
day  after the first to occur of the events described above, and after such
event  but  prior to payment of such amount, Focus shall be deemed to hold
such funds  in  trust for Enerplus. Focus shall only be obligated to pay a
maximum of  $48 million pursuant to this Section 15. In the event that a 
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered  or
made to the Focus Unitholders or to Focus and the Focus Unitholders do  not 
approve the Transaction and such Acquisition Proposal, an amended version 
thereof or any other Acquisition Proposal relating to Focus is not
consummated  within twelve months of the date the first Acquisition Proposal
is publicly  announced, proposed, offered or made; then Focus shall pay to
Enerplus $5  million, in full satisfaction of, and as a fixed amount for
reimbursement  of,  all expenses, including all third party expenses and
costs, of Enerplus in  relation to the Transaction.

 

 

Each  party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Section  15  are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the  damages which Enerplus will suffer or incur as a result of
the event giving  rise  to such damages and resultant termination of this
agreement and are not  penalties. Each of Focus and FET Resources irrevocably
waives any right it  may  have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive  or  punitive. For greater certainty, the
