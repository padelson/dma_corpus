\- v - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

 

THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated July 29, 2014,
is by and among PDC ENERGY, INC., a Nevada corporation (" _PDCE_ "),
LRMOUNTAINEER HOLDINGS, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _LRMH_ ")
(collectively, " _Sellers_ "), PDC MOUNTAINEER, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Company"), and PDC MOUNTAINEER HOLDINGS, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ ").

 

WHEREAS, Sellers own and hold all of the issued and outstanding limited
liability company interests in the Company that are set forth in  _Schedule
2.1_ (the " _Interests_ "); and

WHEREAS, Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
Sellers, the Interests upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I __

 

 _CERTAIN DEFINITIONS_

 

1.1 _Certain Defined Terms_. Unless the context otherwise requires, the
respective terms defined in _Appendix A_ attached hereto and incorporated
herein shall, when used herein, have the respective meanings therein
specified, with each such definition to be equally applicable both to the
singular and the plural forms of the term so defined.

 

1.2 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) All article, section, schedule and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, schedules and exhibits to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. The schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for
all purposes.

 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the plural,
and vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires
otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine
and neutral genders and vice versa. The term "including" and its derivatives
shall mean "including without limitation" and corresponding derivative
expressions. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or article in which
such words appear. The term "cost" includes expense and the term "expense"
includes cost. All references to "dollars" or "$" shall be deemed references
to United States dollars.

 

(c) The Parties stipulate and agree that this Agreement shall be deemed and
considered for all purposes as prepared through the joint efforts of the
Parties, and shall not be construed against one Party or the other as a result
of the preparation, submittal or other event of negotiation, drafting or
execution hereof. (d) The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not
be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.

(e) Any event hereunder requiring the payment of cash or cash equivalents and
any action to be taken hereunder on a day that is not a Business Day shall be
deferred until the first Business Day occurring after such day.

 

(f) Each exhibit and schedule to this Agreement is a part of this Agreement,
but if there is any conflict or inconsistency between the main body of this
Agreement (including _Appendix A_ which shall be considered part of the main
body of this Agreement) and any exhibit or schedule, the provisions of the
main body of this Agreement shall prevail.

 

ARTICLE II

_SALE AND PURCHASE_

2.1 _Sale and Purchase_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Seller agrees to sell and convey to Buyer, and Buyer agrees
to purchase from each Seller, effective as of 12:01 a.m. (local time) on
January 1, 2014 (the " _Effective Time_ "), the Interests set forth next to
each Sellers name on  _Schedule 2.1_.

ARTICLE III

 

 _CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT_

 

3.1 _Consideration_. The consideration for the sale and conveyance of the
Interests to Buyer is Five Hundred Million and No/100
Dollars ($500,000,000.00), as adjusted in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " shall
be the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3 below. The Purchase
Price will be allocated between the Sellers in the manner reflected on
_Schedule 2.1_.

3.2 _Payment_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
has deposited an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price into
the Escrow Account as a deposit hereunder (the " _Performance Deposit_ "). At
the Closing, Buyer shall (a) execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions directing it to immediately wire transfer the Performance Deposit
(together with all interest and other amounts earned thereon) in immediately
available funds to Sellers to the account or accounts specified by Sellers to
Buyer on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date;
(b) wire transfer (i) the Adjusted Cash Amount in immediately available funds
to Sellers to the account or accounts specified by Sellers to Buyer on or
prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (ii) the
Credit Facility Amount in immediately available funds to Wells Fargo Bank to
the account or accounts specified by Wells Fargo Bank to Buyer on or prior to
the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (iii) the Term Loan
Amount in immediately available funds to Wells Fargo Capital to the account or
accounts specified by Wells Fargo Capital to Buyer on or prior to the
Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and (iv) the

 



\- 2 -  Security Escrow Deposit, if any, in immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Escrow Agent; and (c) execute and deliver to Sellers
the Note Documents evidencing Buyers agreement to pay to Sellers an amount
equal to the difference between (i) the Estimated Purchase Price
(incorporating any changes agreed by Buyer and Sellers pursuant to Section
3.4(a)) and (ii) the Cash Amount (the " _Note Amount_ ").

3.3 _Price Adjustments_. The Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows (the
Purchase Price, as adjusted being the Adjusted Purchase Price):

(a) downward by the Adjustment Amount;

 

(b) downward by the amount of the Performance Deposit;

 

(c) downward by the amount of any dividend or other distribution (whether in
stock or property and including any payment in redemption or as consideration
for cancellation) made by the Company to any Seller in respect of the
Interests after the Effective Time or to any other holder of equity interests
of the Company (including Class B Units) in respect of such equity interests
after the Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, any payments by the
Company or any Subsidiary in respect of the cancellation or redemption of the
Class B Units shall result in a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price);

 

(d) except for the payments described in _Schedule 3.3(d)_, downward by the
amount of any payment made by the Company or any Subsidiary to or on behalf
of any Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or any Subsidiary)
after the Effective Time;

 

(e) to the extent that Positive Imbalances and Negative Imbalances were not
taken into account in the calculation of the Adjustment Amount, (i) upward by
an amount equal to the absolute value of any Positive Imbalance Adjustment
Amount owed to the Company by a third party and (ii) downward by an amount
equal to the absolute value of any Negative Imbalance Adjustment Amount owed
by the Company to a third party;

(f) except with respect to the wells listed on  _Schedule 4.2(n)(ii)_, to
the extent that current obligations as of the Effective Time to plug other
wells, dismantle or decommission facilities, close pits and restore the
surface around such wells, facilities and pits were not taken into account in
the calculation of the Adjustment Amount, downward by the amount of
Liabilities attributable thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $150,000
at Closing on account of the wells listed on _Schedule 4.2(n)(i)_ ;

(g) downward for (i) Title Defects, if any, which are not Deferred Adjustment
Claims in accordance with Section 6.2 and (ii) the exclusion of any Title
Defect Properties in accordance with Section 6.5;

 

(h) downward for any Casualty Value in accordance with Section 7.9;

 



\- 3 - (i) downward by the amount of any Company Debt of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time that is not disclosed in the
Financial Statements or in item (3) of _Schedule 4.2(f)_ ; and

 

(j) downward by the amount of any cost or expense paid or incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary after the Effective Time (i) in connection with the
marketing of the Company or the Assets for sale or the preparation,
negotiation and execution of all documents in connection with such marketing
efforts and this Agreement (other than any such costs and expenses (except
for Change of Control Amounts) associated with or related to any of the
Business Employees), including all fees and expenses of attorneys and other
advisors to the Company or any Seller, (ii) to cure Title Defects, solely to
the extent such curative actions were taken in anticipation of the sale of
the Company and were not within the ordinary course of business of the Company
or any Subsidiary or (iii) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(j)_, to
cure breaches of representations or warranties under this Agreement, solely
to the extent such curative actions were taken in anticipation of the sale of
the Company and the Assets and were not within the ordinary course of business
of the Company or any Subsidiary.

3.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Sellers shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Buyer not less than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date Sellers estimate of the
Adjusted Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "). The Estimated
Purchase Price shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement. If Buyer
has any questions or disagreements regarding Sellers calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall contact Sellers at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and in such case Sellers and Buyer
shall in good faith attempt to resolve any disagreements. If Buyer and
Sellers agree on changes to any Estimated Purchase Price based on such
discussions, then the Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing based
on such changes. If Buyer and Sellers do not agree on changes to the Estimated
Purchase Price, then the Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid at the
Closing based on the amounts set forth in Sellers calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price. In either such case, appropriate adjustments to the
Purchase Price shall be made after the Closing pursuant to Section 3.4(b) and
Section 3.4(c).

(b) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date (or such later date
as mutually agreed by Buyer and Sellers), Sellers shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer Sellers calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
3.3 (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "), together with a worksheet showing the
difference, if any, between the Estimated Purchase Price and the Final
Purchase Price. The Final Purchase Price shall be prepared in accordance with
this Agreement. Buyer and Sellers shall promptly provide to each other all
documents reasonably requested by the other to verify any of the items set
forth in the Final Purchase Price calculations. Buyer shall have the right for
thirty (30) days following receipt of the Final Purchase Price to object to
the proposed calculation of the Final Purchase Price (other than with respect
to any Title Defects or Title Benefits asserted but unresolved as of the
Closing, which shall be determined exclusively in accordance with Article
VI). Any objection made by Buyer shall be made in writing and

 



\- 4 -  shall set forth such objection in reasonable detail. Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived any rights to object under this Section 3.4(b) unless Buyer
furnishes its written objections to Sellers within such thirty (30) day
period. If Buyer delivers an objection within such thirty (30) day period,
then Buyer and Sellers shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections.
If, at the end of a fifteen (15) day period from the date of delivery of any
objection by Buyer or such longer period as may be mutually agreed by Buyer
and Sellers, there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the
remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to the
accounting firm of KPMG LLP or such other accounting firm as the Parties may
mutually select (the " _Closing Item Arbitrator_ "). Each of Sellers and Buyer
agree not to engage the Closing Item Arbitrator to perform any services other
than as Closing Item Arbitrator pursuant hereto until the Final Purchase Price
has been finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.4(b). Each of Sellers
and Buyer agrees, if reasonably requested by the Closing Item Arbitrator, to
execute such engagement letter and provide such indemnity and execute such
other agreements as the Closing Item Arbitrator may require as a condition to
such engagement. The Closing Item Arbitrator shall determine the Final
Purchase Price as promptly as reasonably practicable after the objections
that remain in dispute are submitted to it, but in any event within thirty
(30) days after such objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If
any objections are submitted to the Closing Item Arbitrator for resolution,
(i) each of Buyer and Sellers shall furnish to the Closing Item Arbitrator
such work papers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Closing Item Arbitrator may request and are reasonably
available to that Party (or its independent public accountants or other
representatives) and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Closing Item Arbitrator any material relating to the determination of
the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Closing
Item Arbitrator, (ii) the Closing Item Arbitrator shall not assign a value to
any item in dispute that is greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by Sellers, on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, and (iii) the determination by the Closing Item
Arbitrator of the Final Purchase Price, as set forth in a written notice
delivered to both Buyer and Sellers by the Closing Item Arbitrator, shall be
made in accordance with this Agreement and shall be binding and conclusive on
the Parties and, absent manifest error, shall constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof. Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall each bear their own legal fees and other
costs in connection with any such objection; _provided_ , that the fees and
expenses of the Closing Item Arbitrator will be paid by and apportioned
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, based on the
aggregate dollar amount of the dollar value difference in aggregate between
Sellers and Buyers proposed Purchase Price adjustments and inversely related
to the relative recovery as determined by the Closing Item Arbitrator of Buyer
and Sellers, respectively (for example, if the aggregate dollar amount of the
amount in dispute is $1,000,000 and the relative recovery Buyer and Sellers as
determined by the Closing Item Arbitrator is $900,000 and $100,000,
respectively, then Sellers will be apportioned 90% of the fees and expenses
and Buyer will be apportioned 10% of the fees and expenses). Sellers and Buyer
shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the matter submitted to the Closing Item Arbitrator for
resolution, pay to the Closing Item Arbitrator the amount of fees and expenses
of the Closing Item Arbitrator payable by Sellers and Buyer pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

 



\- 5 - (c) _Adjustments_. Following the final determination of the Final
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.4:

(i) if the Final Purchase Price as determined pursuant to this Section 3.4 is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount of such shortfall, if any,
the " _Aggregate Consideration Deficit_ "), then the then outstanding
principal balance of the Note shall be reduced by the amount of the Aggregate
Consideration Deficit; _provided, however_ , (i) to the extent that the
Aggregate Consideration Deficit exceeds the then outstanding principal balance
of the Note and a Security Escrow Deposit exists, Sellers and Buyer shall
provide (within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Final
Purchase Price) joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to
disburse to Buyer from the Security Escrow Fund an amount equal to
such shortfall, and (ii) if no Security Escrow Deposit exists or to the
extent that the Aggregate Consideration Deficit exceeds the sum of (x) the
then outstanding principal balance of the Note and (y) the amount of the
Security Escrow Fund, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount of cash equal to
such shortfall; or

(ii) if the Final Purchase Price as determined pursuant to this Section 3.4
is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount of such excess, if
any, the " _Aggregate Consideration Surplus_ "), then an amount of cash equal
to such Aggregate Consideration Surplus shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers.

The amount, if any, payable as provided in clause (i) or (ii) above
is referred to as the " _Final Payment Amount_ ". Any cash amount owing by
one Party to the other pursuant to this Section 3.4(c) shall be paid promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the
Final Payment Amount) by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated by the
applicable payee. Any reduction to the principal balance of the Note pursuant
to clause (i) above shall be effective as of the date of the determination of
the Final Payment Amount and shall be evidenced in writing, executed and
promptly delivered by Sellers to Buyer. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
no interest shall accrue or be paid on the Final Payment Amount.

(d) _No Duplicative Effect_. The provisions of this Section 3.4 shall apply
in such a manner so as not to give the components and calculations duplicative
effect to any item of adjustment and, except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, the Parties covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or
is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or
reduction) more than once in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price or
any component of any of the foregoing, or any other calculated amount
pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either
as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be overstated or

ARTICLE VI __

 

 _TITLE ADJUSTMENTS_

 

6.1 _No Warranty or Representation_. Without limiting Buyers right to adjust
the Purchase Price by operation of Section 6.2 and Section 6.5, and subject
to certain representations and warranties made by Sellers in Section 4.2(u)
and Section 4.2(ff), Sellers make no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Companys or any
Subsidiarys title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, except as provided above, Buyers sole remedy for any defect of
title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets shall be
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article VI, which remedies shall
cease, and be deemed to be finally and conclusively satisfied or waived, in
all respects, upon the Closing. Furthermore, except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement, Sellers make no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of the information, records and data now, heretofore
or hereafter made available to Buyer in connection with this Agreement
(including, without limitation, pricing assumptions, potential for production
of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons from the Subject Interests or any other
matters contained in or related to the Reserve Report or any other material
furnished to Buyer by the Company, the Subsidiaries, Sellers or by any of
their respective agents or representatives).

 



\- 25 - 6.2 _Buyer s Title Review_.

 

(a) _Buyer s Assertion of Title Defects_. During the period commencing on the
execution of this Agreement and terminating on September 12, 2014 (the "
_Title Examination Period_ "), Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing of any
matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and
which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect with respect to any portion
of a Property Subdivision pursuant to this Article VI. For all purposes of
this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Title Defect which
Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by written notice given to Sellers on
or before the expiration of the Title Examination Period. To be effective,
Buyers written notice of a Title Defect must include (i) a brief description
of the matter constituting the asserted Title Defect, (ii) the claimed Title
Defect Amount attributable thereto and the reasonable computations and
information upon which (in Buyers reasonable judgment) Buyers claim is
based, and (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers (as
well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Sellers) to verify the
existence of such asserted Title Defect. To give Sellers an opportunity to
commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to give Sellers written notice of any Title Defect which
Buyer determines exists no later than the end of the calendar week in which
Buyer determines the existence of same, which notice may be preliminary in
nature and supplemented prior to the end of the Title Examination Period;
_provided, however,_ that the failure to inform Sellers of a Title Defect
shall not prejudice Buyers right to assert such Title Defect in accordance
with the terms of this Article VI. Buyer shall also promptly furnish Sellers
with written notice of any Seller Title Credit which is discovered by any of
Buyers employees or representatives while conducting Buyers title review,
due diligence or investigation with respect to the Subject Interests and
Property Subdivisions.

(b) _Purchase Price Allocations_. A portion of the Purchase Price has been
allocated by Buyer to the various Subject Interests in Property Subdivisions
in the manner and in accordance with the respective values set forth in Part
II of the Property Schedule. If any adjustment is made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 6.2, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the affected Property Subdivision
in Part II of the Property Schedule.

 

(c) _Sellers  Opportunity to Cure_. Sellers shall have thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the Title Examination Period, at their cost and expense, if
they so elect but without obligation, to cure all or a portion of such
asserted Title Defects. Any asserted Title Defects which are waived by Buyer
or cured within such time shall be deemed "Permitted Encumbrances" hereunder.
If within such time frame Sellers fail to cure any Title Defect of which Buyer
has given timely written notice as required above and Buyer has not and does
not waive the same on or before the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Property Subdivision affected by such uncured and unwaived Title
Defect shall be a " _Title Defect Property_."

 

(d) _Buyer s Title Adjustments_. Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6, and as
otherwise provided in this Agreement on account of a breach by Sellers of the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.2(u), as Buyers sole and
exclusive

 



\- 26 -  remedy with respect to Title Defects, Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the
Purchase Price by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of Title
Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect Properties exceeds an amount
equal to (x) three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Defect
Deductible_ ") _plus_ (y) the aggregate amount of Seller Title Credits with
respect to all Property Subdivisions to the extent the sum of such Seller
Title Credits exceeds three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to this Section 6.2(d) with respect to a Title Defect Property
described in (i) Part II(A) of the Property Schedule is $100,000 or less or
(ii) Part II(B) of the Property Schedule is $50,000 or less, or (b) the amount
of a Seller Title Credit determined pursuant to Section 6.4 described in (i)
Part II(A) of the Property Schedule is $100,000 or less or (ii) Part II(B) of
the Property Schedule is $50,000 or less, then the Title Defect Amount with
respect to such Title Defect Property or the amount of such Seller Title
Credit, as applicable, shall be deemed to be zero. As used herein, the term "
_Title Defect Amount_ " shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property,
the amount by which the value of such Title Defect Property is impaired as a
result of the existence of one or more uncured and unwaived Title Defects,
which amount shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) If the Title Defect results from the Company or any Subsidiary, as
applicable, having a lesser Net Revenue Interest in such Title Defect
Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II of the
Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the reduction in the Net Revenue Interest and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Title
Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule.

(ii) If the Title Defect results from the Company or any Subsidiary, as
applicable, having a greater Working Interest in a Title Defect Property set
forth in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule than the Working Interest
specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect
Amount shall be equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded
annually) of the increase in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve
Report with respect to such Title Defect Property for the period from and
after the Effective Time which is attributable to such increase in the
Companys or any Subsidiarys, as applicable, Working Interest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to
the extent that an increase in the Companys or any Subsidiarys, as
applicable, Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision has the effect of
proportionately increasing the Companys or any Subsidiarys, as applicable,
Net Revenue Interest therein.

 

(iii) If the Title Defect results from the Company or any Subsidiary, as
applicable, having a fewer number of Net Acres in a Title Defect Property set
forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule than the number of Net Acres
specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect
Amount shall be the product of the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
such Title

 



\- 27 -  Defect Property set forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, multiplied
by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is an amount equal to the remainder
of (1) the Net Acres for such portion of the Title Defect Property set forth
in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule _minus_ (2) the Net Acres for such
Title Defect Property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable,
and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Acres for such the portion of the
Title Defect Property set forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule.

(iv) If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien, mortgage,
security interest or pledge in or of such Title Defect Property, then the
Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect Property shall be the amount
required to discharge such lien, mortgage, security interest or pledge, but
only if such amount is undisputed.

(v) If the Title Defect results from the existence of such Title Defect
Property containing a (1) consent to assign in favor of a third party that is
not obtained and that, by the express terms of the contract containing such
consent, results in the termination of the Companys or any Subsidiarys, as
applicable, rights to and interests in such Title Defect Property, or (2)
Preference Right that is triggered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and is exercised by the holder of
such Preference Right, then, in each case, the Title Defect Amount for such
Title Defect Property shall be an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated (or deemed allocated pursuant to Section 6.2(d)(ix)) to such
Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule.

(vi) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an
amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property
affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such
Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated in Part II of the Property Schedule to
such Title Defect Property); _provided_ , _however_ , if such Title Defect is
reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be
greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect.

 

(vii) If a Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the
entire productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact shall be
taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.

(viii) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a lien
affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect
to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the
curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect
Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien (if such amount is
undisputed) or the cost and expense of such curative work shall only be
included in the Title Defect Amount for one Title Defect Property and only
once in such Title Defect Amount.

 



\- 28 - (ix) If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision
(as contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Property
Subdivision) and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated
specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in the Property
Schedule, then for purposes of computing the Title Defect Amount, the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision shall be further
allocated among the portions of such Property Subdivision in the proportion
that the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) of such Property
Subdivision affected by such Title Defect bears to the net acreage (or net
acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property Subdivision. In the event
such Property Subdivision is subject to a unitization agreement,
the foregoing allocation shall be made in a manner which is consistent with
the allocation of production or productive acreage in such unitization
agreement.

 

(x) The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or any
portion thereof shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such Title Defect Property or such portion thereof calculated in accordance
with paragraph (ix) above. For example, but without limitation, if the Company
or any Subsidiary, as applicable, does not own fifty percent (50%) of the Net
Revenue Interest specified in the Property Schedule for a Title Defect
Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest is also burdened by a
lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect Property shall not exceed
the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such fifty percent (50%)
interest notwithstanding that it may be affected by multiple Title Defects.

 

The Defect Deductible shall be restored to the extent that any portion thereof
is applied as a credit against a Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title
Defect which is subsequently cured by Sellers or determined not to constitute
a Title Defect pursuant to Section 6.6 below. For the avoidance of doubt, if
Seller elects to exclude a Title Defect Property from the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the remedy set forth in Section
6.5, then, after such election, the Title Defect Amount related to such
excluded Title Defect Property (x) will not be counted towards the Defect
Deductible and (y) will be counted for purposes of Section 9.1(f) and Section
9.2(f).

6.3 _Determination of Title Defects_. A portion of a Property Subdivision
shall be deemed to have a " _Title Defect_ " if neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has Defensible Title thereto as of the Effective Time (or, with
respect to any Property Subdivision that was acquired by the Company or any
Subsidiary after the Effective Time, as of such date of acquisition) and as of
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the following matters shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances
and shall not be asserted as, and shall not constitute Title Defects: (a)
defects in the early chain of the title consisting of the mere failure to
recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship
or estate proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
failure or omission results in another Persons superior claim of title to the
relevant Property Subdivision or portion 

 



\- 29 -  thereof, (b) defects arising out of lack of survey, (c) defects arising out
of lack of corporate or other entity authorization, unless Buyer provides
affirmative evidence that such corporate or other entity action was not
authorized and results in another Persons superior claim of title to the
relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof, (d) defects that have been
cured by possession under the applicable statutes of limitations or
prescription, (e) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to
probate proceedings or the lack thereof, which defects or irregularities have
been outstanding for four (4) years or more, (f) defects based solely on the
existence of prior oil and gas leases relating to the Subject Interests that
are expired and no longer in force and legal effect but not surrendered of
record, (g) defects arising from a mortgage encumbering the oil, gas
or mineral estate of any lessor (unless such lessor is in default in such
mortgage or a complaint of foreclosure has been filed or any similar action
taken by the mortgagee thereunder and in such case such mortgage has not been
subordinated to the Subject Interests affected thereby), (h) defects based
solely on lack of information in Sellers, the Companys or any Subsidiarys
files or references to documents if such documents are not in Sellers, the
Companys or any Subsidiarys files, (i) defects arising out of pooling
elections or non-consent elections made by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries occurring on or after the date of this Agreement (but not arising
out of any elections in violation of any provision in this Agreement), (j)
defects arising from breaks in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1990
relating to assignments of oil and gas interests, unless Buyer provides
affirmative evidence that the defect results in another Persons superior
claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof, (k)
other defects in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1960, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that the defect results in another Persons
superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion
thereof, and (l) defects arising out of the fact that any oil and gas lease
included in the Assets does not allow for pooling or unitization.

6.4 _Seller Title Credit_. A " _Seller Title Credit_ " shall mean, with
respect to a Property Subdivision, the amount by which the value of such
Property Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of (a) the Company or any
Subsidiary, as applicable, having a greater Net Revenue Interest in such
Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part
II of the Property Schedule, (b) with respect to each Property Subdivision
described in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Company or any
Subsidiary, as applicable, having a lesser Working Interest in such
Property Subdivision than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part
II(A) of the Property Schedule without a corresponding reduction in Net
Revenue Interest with respect to such Property Subdivision specified therefor
in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule or (c) with respect to each Property
Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Company or
any Subsidiary, as applicable, having a greater number of Net Acres than the
number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property
Schedule. The amount of Seller Title Credits shall be determined as follows:

(i) If the Seller Title Credit results from the Company or any Subsidiary, as
applicable, having a greater Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision
than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II of the Property
Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property
Subdivision in Part II of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the increase in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Property Subdivision in
Part II of the Property Schedule.

 



\- 30 - (ii) If the Seller Title Credit results from the Company or any Subsidiary,
as applicable, having a lesser Working Interest in a Property Subdivision
than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property
Schedule without a corresponding reduction in Net Revenue Interest with
respect to such Property Subdivision specified therefor in Part II(A) of the
Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the present value
(discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the decrease in the costs and
expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with respect to such Property
Subdivision for the period from and after the Effective Time which is
attributable to such decrease in the Companys or any Subsidiarys, as
applicable, Working Interest; _provided_ , _however_ , no Seller Title Credit
shall be allowed on account of and to the extent that a decrease in Sellers
Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision has the effect of
proportionately decreasing the Companys or any Subsidiarys, as applicable,
Net Revenue Interest therein.

(iii) With respect to either (i) a lease comprising a Property
Subdivision that was acquired by the Company prior to January 1, 2014, or
(ii) a lease comprising a Property Subdivision that was obtained by the
Company due to a swap or exchange transaction with a transaction with a third
party whether prior to, on or after January 1, 2014, if the Title Defect
results from Buyer having greater number of Net Acres in a Property
Subdivision than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of
the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be the product of the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part
II(B) of the Property Schedule, multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of
which is an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the Net Acres for such Title
Defect Property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, _minus_
(2) the Net Acres for such Property Subdivision set forth in Part II(B) of the
Property Schedule, and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Acres for such
Property Subdivision set forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.4(iii) shall not apply to a lease
comprising a Property Subdivision that was acquired by the Company pursuant
to a leasing transaction on or after January 1, 2014.

(iv) In determining the amount of Seller Title Credits, the principles and
methodology set forth in paragraphs (vii) and (ix) of Section 6.2(d) shall be
applied, _mutatis mutandis_.

 

Furthermore, a Seller Title Credit shall also be deemed to exist if the
Company or any Subsidiary owns undeveloped Net Acres derived from an oil and
gas lease that is not included in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule. The
amount of any such Seller Title Credit shall be calculated by multiplying (1)
the number of Net Acres owned by the Company or any Subsidiary in such oil and
gas lease by (2) the Net Acre Price assigned in Part II(B) of the Property
Schedule to Net Acres that are closest by geographic proximity to the Net
Acres that are the subject of such Seller Title Credit.

 



\- 31 - 6.5 _Exclusion of Title Defect Properties_. If (i) Sellers dispute in good
faith the existence of a Title Defect asserted by Buyer or the Title Defect
Amount attributable thereto, (ii) Sellers deliver to Buyer a written summary
of such dispute at least seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
such dispute is not resolved in writing by Sellers and Buyer prior to the
third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall have the right to
cause the Property Subdivision(s) affected by such asserted Title Defect
(together with a pro rata share of all incidental rights, oil, gas and other
hydrocarbons and other assets attributable or appurtenant thereto) to be
transferred by the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, to a Person
designated by Sellers so long as the Purchase Price is reduced by the portion
of the Purchase Price allocated (or deemed allocated pursuant to Section
6.2(d)(ix)) to such Property Subdivision(s) in Part II of the Property
Schedule; _provided, however_ , that no such right in favor of Sellers shall
exist if, prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
Buyer shall agree in writing to the position taken by Sellers with respect to
such asserted Title Defect and/or Title Defect Amount, as applicable.

 

6.6 _Deferred Claims and Disputes_. In the event that Buyer and Sellers have
not agreed upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by Buyer
or Sellers pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this Article
VI, any such claim (a " _Deferred Adjustment Claim_ ") shall be settled
pursuant to this Section 6.6 and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(f) and
9.2(f), shall not prevent or delay Closing. With respect to each potential
Deferred Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Sellers shall deliver to the other a
written notice describing each such potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, the
amount in dispute and a statement setting forth the facts and circumstances
that support such Partys position with respect to such Deferred Adjustment
Claim. At Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on account of,
and except as provided in Sections 9.1(f) and 9.2(f), no effect shall be given
to the Deferred Adjustment Claim. On or prior to the thirtieth (30th)
consecutive calendar day following the Closing Date (the " _Deferred Matters
Date_ "), Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on
the Deferred Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve by written
agreement all disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment Claims. Any
Deferred Adjustment Claims which are not so resolved on or before the
Deferred Matters Date shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in
accordance with Section 14.11; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers may elect
at any time to resolve any or all disputes relating to one or more Deferred
Adjustment Claims by the payment to Buyer (in the manner set forth below for
the payment by Sellers to Buyer of any amount determined by the arbitration
panel to be owed to Buyer on account of Deferred Adjustment Claim(s)) of the
amount by which the Purchase Price would have been reduced at Closing on
account of the Title Defect(s) which constitute such Deferred Adjustment
Claim(s) if same did not constitute Deferred Adjustment Claim(s).
Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, including Section
6.2(c), Sellers shall be entitled to cure any Title Defect which constitutes a
Deferred Adjustment Claim at any time prior to the point in time when a final
and binding written decision of the arbitration panel is made in accordance
with Section 14.11. Upon the arbitration panel making a determination, or
Buyer and Sellers agreeing after Closing, that the Purchase Price should
be reduced pursuant to the terms of this Article VI on account of the
Deferred Adjustment Claims, then, within five (5) Business Days of such
determination or agreement, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such
reduction (the " _Deferred Adjustment Claims Amount_ ") in the following
manner: (i) if the Note has not been paid in full, the then outstanding
principal balance of the Note shall be reduced by the Deferred Adjustment
Claims Amount; (ii) if the Note has been paid in full or to the extent the

 



\- 32 -  Deferred Adjustment Claims Amount exceeds the then outstanding principal
balance of the Note and a Security Escrow Deposit exists, Sellers and Buyer
shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to
disburse to Buyer from the Security Escrow Fund an amount equal to the portion
of the Deferred Adjustment Claims Amount that has not been funded by the
reduction of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note; and (iii)
any portion of the Deferred Adjustment Claims Amount that is not paid to Buyer
in the manner provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be paid by Sellers
to Buyer in cash. Any reduction to the principal balance of the Note pursuant
to clause (i) above shall be effective as of the date of the determination or
agreement as to the Deferred Adjustment Claims Amount and shall be evidenced
in writing executed and promptly delivered by Sellers to Buyer.

 

6.7 _No Duplication_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if a Title Defect results from any matter which could also result
in the breach of any representation or warranty of either Seller set forth in
Section 4.1 or Section 4.2, then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such
matter as a Title Defect pursuant to this Article VI and shall be precluded
from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such
representation or warranty.

the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which, to the Knowledge
of the Company, causes or would be reasonably likely to cause the condition in
Section 9.2(a) to fail to be satisfied and (B) the failure of Sellers to
comply with 

 



\- 36 -  or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or agreement to be complied
with by them hereunder prior to Closing. Without in any way affecting Sellers
rights under Section 7.8, no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of Sellers hereunder, the conditions to the
respective obligations of the Parties hereunder, or Buyers rights under
Article XII.

 

Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section 7.1, nothing contained herein
shall give Buyer any right to manage, control, direct or be involved in the
management of Sellers, the Company or the Subsidiaries.

7.2 _Qualifications on Conduct_. Sellers, the Company and the Subsidiaries,
as applicable, may take (or not take or adhere to, as the case may be) any of
the actions or restrictions mentioned in Section 7.1 above if reasonably
necessary under emergency circumstances provided Buyer is notified as soon
thereafter as practicable.

7.3 _Goodwill and Business Relationships_. Sellers, the Company, and all of
the Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) preserve
intact the goodwill of the Business of the Company and (ii) preserve intact
business relationships with suppliers, customers, contractors and others
having business relationships with the Company and the Subsidiaries.

7.4 _Public Announcements_. Until Closing, without the prior written
approval of Buyer (in the case of announcements by a Seller) or Sellers (in
the case of announcements by Buyer), which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, no Party will issue, or permit any agent or Affiliate of
such Party to issue, any press releases or otherwise make, or cause any agent
or Affiliate to make, any public statements with respect to the existence of
this Agreement, the contents hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby,
except where such release or statement is deemed in good faith by the
releasing Person to be required by Law or any national securities exchange, in
which case the Person or Persons will use its or their, as the case may be,
commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice to the other Party
prior to any release or statement. Upon Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate.

7.5 _Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, and without need for further
consideration, Sellers, the Company, and Buyer agree that, from time to time,
whether at or after the Closing Date, they will execute and deliver or cause
their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver such other documents,
agreements and writings, do all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and take such other action as may be
reasonably necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including cooperating fully with the other
Party and making all necessary filings with Governmental Authorities. If, at
any time after the Closing Date, any further commercially reasonable actions
are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer
will use commercially reasonable efforts to take those reasonably necessary
actions and cause their respective Affiliates to take those reasonably
necessary actions, including but not limited to executing and delivering such
further agreements, conveyances, assignments, certificates, instruments and
documents and perform such other actions as the requesting Party may
reasonably request in order to fully consummate the foregoing actions.

 

(b) Sellers and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with industry practice to attempt to obtain all of the consents to
assign and waivers of Preference Rights that are listed on _Schedule 4.2(i)_.

 



\- 37 - 7.6 _Removal_. Following the Closing, neither Buyer, the Company nor any
Subsidiary shall have any right to use the name or mark of either Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates (or any variation or derivative thereof) or
the logos relating thereto and, as promptly as practicable, but in any case
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall remove the name
and mark of each Seller and any of their respective Affiliates and any
variations and derivatives thereof and logos relating thereto from the Assets.
Furthermore, as soon as practicable following the Closing, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days after Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Company and the applicable Subsidiaries to, change the name of the Company and
each of the Subsidiaries whose name includes "PDC" to a name that does not
include "PDC" or comprise any colorable imitations thereof. Because damages
would be an inadequate remedy, the Parties agree that Sellers shall be
entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for
any breach by Buyer of this Section 7.6.

7.7 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) Within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
furnish to Buyer any or all of the books, records, contracts, agreements and
files relating to the Business, the Company and the Subsidiaries on or before
the Closing Date (collectively, " _Records_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
Seller may retain copies of the Records. Sellers shall maintain the
confidentiality of such Records and not disclose them to any Person or use
them for any purpose, except to the extent required by Law, court order,
subpoena or request of information from a Governmental Authority or to the
extent reasonably necessary for Tax reporting and defending against Actions
against Sellers or any claim for which any Seller may have any Liability.

 

(b) Buyer shall preserve and maintain a copy of all Records in Buyers
possession for a period of not less than five (5) years after the Closing
Date. After such five (5) year period, before Buyer shall dispose of any
Records, Buyer shall give Sellers at least ninety (90) days prior notice to
such effect, and Sellers shall be given an opportunity, at their cost and
expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such Records as Sellers may

disputes relating in any way to this Agreement or the transactions evidenced
hereby.

7.8 _Amendment of Schedules_. Buyer agrees that, with respect to (but only
with respect to) the representations and warranties of each Seller and the
Company contained in this Agreement, each Seller and the Company shall have
the continuing right until the Closing to add 

 



\- 38 -  new schedules to such representations and warranties and to supplement or
amend all schedules to such representations and warranties that exist as of
the date of this Agreement with respect to, in each case, any matter
hereafter arising which, if existing on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in a schedule to this Agreement to
avoid any such representation and warranty not being true and correct as of
the Closing Date (even though, the existence of such matter as of the Closing
Date but for such addition, supplement or amendment, results in the breach of
any such representation and warranty). For the avoidance of doubt, no
matter may be included in any such new schedule, supplement or amendment
which existed prior to the date of this Agreement, whether known or unknown,
except for any matter that existed prior to the date of this Agreement that
relates to any portion of any representation or warranty that is qualified to
the Knowledge of any Seller or the Company if any Seller or the Company, as
applicable, (i) did not have Knowledge of such matter as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) gains Knowledge of such matter prior to the Closing.
Solely for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section
9.2(a) have been fulfilled, the schedules to the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement
and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto.

 

7.9 _Casualty_.

 

(a) If any Casualty Loss occurs from and after the date hereof through and
including the date immediately preceding the Closing Date causing a loss or
reduction in value exceeding $5,000,000, the Purchase Price will be reduced by
an amount equal to the value of such Casualty Loss, less any insurance
proceeds payable on account of such Casualty Loss (the " _Casualty Value_ "),
in which case Sellers shall at the Closing (a) assign to Buyer Sellers right
to receive all insurance proceeds or payments owed to Sellers by reason of
such destruction, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Sellers
in collecting same, and (b) pay to Buyer all insurance proceeds or payments
theretofore paid to Sellers by reason of such destruction or damage and not
used or applied by Sellers, the Company, or the Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date to repair, restore or replace such destroyed or damaged Assets,
less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in collecting same.

 

(b) The Casualty Value shall be determined before the Closing by Sellers and
Buyer in good faith, or if Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree on such
amount, in accordance with Section 14.11. The determination of Casualty Value
shall be determined based on and giving due consideration of, and shall not
exceed, the allocated value of the Property Subdivisions to which such
Casualty Value relates as set forth in Part II of the Property Schedule.

7.10 _Government Reviews_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers, the Company,
and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to make or cause to be promptly made (and, in
the case of filings required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act, not later
than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) the
filings required of such Party or any of its Affiliates under any Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay any
fees due of it in connection with such filings. In

 



\- 39 -  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sellers, the Company,
and Buyer shall, to the extent permissible by Law, (a) reasonably cooperate
with the other Party and furnish to the other Party all non-confidential
information in such Partys possession that is necessary in connection with
such other Partys filings, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the early termination or the expiration of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act and any other Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is reasonably practicable, (c)
promptly inform the other Party of any significant communication from or to,
and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Authority
in respect of such filings, (d) consult and reasonably cooperate with the
other Party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions made or submitted by or on behalf
of any Party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings with any
Governmental Authority relating to such filings, and (e) comply, as promptly
as is reasonably practicable, with any requests received by such Party or any
of its Affiliates under the HSR Act and any other Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing shall not require any Party or its Affiliates to divest any assets,
modify its business or incur material Liabilities. If a Party intends to
participate in any face-to-face meeting with any Governmental Authority with
respect to such filings, it shall give the other Party reasonable prior
notice of, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental Authority, an
opportunity to participate face-to-face in, such meeting.

 

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) On or before the Closing, Sellers shall take all actions, if any,
necessary to cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to cease to be adopting
or participating employers, as applicable, with respect to all PDCE Plans.

(b) PDCE shall take such actions as are necessary so that all PDCE Business
Employees are available for meetings with Buyer or any of its Affiliates
within five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement. No later
than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall offer employment to any such PDCE Business Employees as Buyer may
determine in its sole discretion. Each such offer of employment shall be (i)
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) contingent upon the PDCE
Business Employees satisfaction of Buyers or its Affiliates drug testing
and background check hiring criteria, and (iii) held open for not less than
five (5) Business Days after the offer is made. PDCE will cooperate with
Buyer in encouraging the PDCE Business Employees to accept any offers of
employment made by Buyer or its Affiliate(s) pursuant to this Section 7.11(b).
PDCE Business Employees who accept the offers of employment made pursuant to
this Section 7.11(b) shall be collectively referred to as " _Transferred
Employees_." At the time of Closing, PDCE shall terminate the employment by
PDCE of all Transferred Employees (other than those who are on Leave), and
such Transferred Employees shall become employees of Buyer or its Affiliate(s)
on the day immediately following the Closing Date. In the case of a
Transferred Employee who is an Inactive Employee, the Inactive Employee will
become an employee of Buyer or its Affiliate, if at all, on or as of the date
such Inactive Employee returns to active employment, provided that the
Inactive Employee returns to active employment within the time required under
the original terms and conditions applicable to the Leave, and within 180
days after Closing, subject to any applicable legal

 



\- 40 -  requirement. Buyer shall promptly inform PDCE in writing of the identity of
each Transferred Employee. Buyer shall indemnify PDCE and its Affiliates with
respect to all Covered Liabilities relating to or arising out of the breach
by Buyer of any Law in connection with Buyers selection and offer process
relating to PDCE Business Employees. Other than with respect to Covered
Liabilities referenced in the prior sentence and liabilities of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to (i) personal injury or death
occurring on or after the Effective Time and (ii) amounts that are owed by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to the period prior to the
Closing for hourly wages or base salary earned and unpaid through the Closing
or for reimburseable business expenses which have not through the Closing been
reimbursed that are properly invoiced within thirty (30) days of the Closing,
all other liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any
PDCE Business Employees who are not Transferred Employees shall be deemed to
be " _Seller Retained Liabilities_ " under this Agreement.

 

(c) Other than employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
which Buyer has at least ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date
delivered a written notice to Sellers setting forth those employees which
Buyer has determined in its sole discretion to continue with the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, on and after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall terminate each of its employees at the Closing
effective as of the Closing. All liabilities of the Company or the
Subsidiaries (other than liabilities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
with respect to (i) personal injury or death occurring on or after the
Effective Time and (ii) amounts that are owed by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing but not due and payable by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries until after the Closing for hourly wages or base
salary earned and unpaid through the Closing or for reimburseable business
expenses which have not through the Closing been reimbursed) with respect to
any such terminated employees shall be deemed to be " _Seller Retained
Liabilities_ " under this Agreement.

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.11 with respect to employees and employee benefits are included for
the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (i)
in any other Person, including current or former Transferred Employees, or
(ii) to continued employment with Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates.

7.12 _Surety Bonds_. On or before three (3) days following the Closing Date,
Buyer will obtain Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates release
from any surety bonds of the Company and any Subsidiary set forth in 
_Schedule 7.12_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to, indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons from
and against, and shall hold each of them harmless from, any and all
Covered Liabilities incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons
pursuant to or arising out of such surety bonds. Neither Sellers nor their
Affiliates shall have any obligation to keep such surety bonds in effect after
three (3) days following the Closing Date.

7.13 _Permits_. Buyer shall provide all notices and otherwise take all actions
reasonably required to transfer or reissue any Permits (including
Environmental Permits) that are required

 



\- 41 -  on or after the Closing Date to be transferred or reissued as a result of or
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to provide
information necessary to apply for such Permits.

7.14 _Insurance_. Sellers agree to maintain all policies of insurance carried
by PDCE that insure the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Business and the Assets
(the " _PDCE Policies_ ") in full force and effect until Closing. All coverage
and benefits under the PDCE Policies and any other insurance policies of
Sellers or their Affiliates (subject to the terms thereof) relating to the
Company, the Subsidiaries, the Business or the Assets shall cease at the

disparage the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be
responsible for the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the satisfaction of the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Section 7.16.

7.17  _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, (i) each Seller, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its

\- 43 - ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

8.1  _Tax Treatment_. Sellers and Buyer intend that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
as (i) a sale of the Interests by the Sellers and (ii) a purchase by Buyer of
the Assets (subject to the liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries)
pursuant to Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. Except as
required by Law, none of the Parties shall take any position for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes (and state and local Tax purposes to the extent
applicable) that is inconsistent with such treatment (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "). As a result of the Intended Tax Treatment, the Parties agree
that the Companys classification for U.S. federal income Tax purposes will
change from a partnership to being disregarded as an entity separate from
Buyer, with the result that the Companys Tax year for U.S. federal (and
applicable state) income Tax purposes will end on the Closing Date.

8.2 _Final 1065_. Sellers, at their sole cost and expense, shall have the sole
and exclusive authority to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the
Company its Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, for the Tax year
that includes and ends on the Closing Date, including the issuance of a
Schedule K-1, Partners Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., to each
Person who was a partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the Company
during such Tax year. Upon delivery of a copy of such Form 1065 to Buyer,
Buyer shall cause the Company to execute and file such Form 1065 with the
Internal Revenue Service.

8.3 _Tax Liability_.

 

(a) All Asset Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Sellers as of the
Effective Time for all Taxable periods that include the Effective Time. All
Asset Taxes attributable to periods, including partial periods, prior to the
Effective Time are the obligation of, and shall be borne by, Sellers. All
Asset Taxes attributable to periods, including partial periods, from
and after the Effective Time shall be borne by Buyer. In determining the
amount of Asset Taxes that are allocable between Buyer and Sellers pursuant to
this Section 8.3, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to severance or
production shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (ii) Asset Taxes that
are ad valorem, property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of
such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the date on which the
Effective Time occurs and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the
date on which the Effective Time occurs by prorating each such Asset Tax
based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the
number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand.

(b) Except to the extent taken into account as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, if Buyer pays any Asset Taxes allocated to Sellers pursuant
to this Section 8.3, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for the amount of such
Asset Taxes within 30 days after written demand therefor.

 



\- 44 - 8.4 _Tax Allocation_. On or prior to Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall agree on
an allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted hereunder, among the Assets
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ ") consistent with Part II of the Property
Schedule. Buyer and Sellers shall confer and cooperate on any revisions to the
Allocation (the " _Revised Allocation_ ") so as to report any matters related
to the Allocation that require updating (including adjustments to the
Purchase Price) to be consistent with the agreed allocation. Sellers and Buyer
shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns,
including IRS Form 8594, in a manner consistent with the Allocation or, if
applicable, the Revised Allocation, and will not take, or permit their
respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with such Allocation
(or Revised Allocation) unless required to do so by applicable Law, or a
"determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(i) of the Code.

8.5 _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, Sellers
and Buyer shall:

(a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist), to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in preparing any Tax Returns;

(b) cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party in preparing for any audit, litigation, contest, dispute, negotiation,
or other proceeding regarding Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries; and

 

(c) make available to the other Party and to any Taxing Authority, as
reasonably requested, all relevant information, records, and documents
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, information necessary to file Tax Return
extensions and make estimated Tax payments).

 

8.6 _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties do not anticipate that any transfer, sales,
use, value added, excise, filing, recording, documentary, stamp or other
similar Taxes will arise as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Transfer Taxes arise as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of any and all such
Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Buyer. The Parties agree to cooperate fully
with each other to minimize any such liability for Transfer Taxes to
the extent legally permissible, and the Parties shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns regarding any Transfer
Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

12.4 _Indemnification and Defense Procedures_. A Person which is entitled to
be indemnified under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 or 12.3 is herein
referred to as an " _Indemnified Person_ " and the Party which is obligated to
indemnify an Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 or
12.3 is herein referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " with respect to the
matter for which it is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Person. All
claims for indemnification under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and 12.3
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) If a third-party claim for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3 (an "
_Indemnified Claim_ ") is made against an Indemnified Person, and if Buyer or
Sellers intend to seek indemnity with respect thereto by or from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3,
then the Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified
Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("
_Claim Notice_ ") (i) notifying such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnified
Claim and requesting indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person with
respect to such Indemnified Claim under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2
and/or 12.3, as the case may be, (ii) setting forth the full name, address for
all notices and the authorized representatives of such Indemnified Person
with respect to such Indemnified Claim, and (iii) describing in reasonable
detail the nature of the Indemnified Claim, including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Indemnified Claim (if any) and the basis of such
request for indemnification under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or
12.3, as the case may be. Failure to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall
not affect the right of the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby;
_provided that_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to defend,
indemnify or otherwise hold harmless an Indemnified Person with respect to a
third-party claim until a Claim Notice meeting the foregoing requirements is
furnished to the Indemnifying Party by the Party seeking indemnity hereunder.
Within thirty (30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the " _Election
Period_ ") from a Party, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Party who
sent the Claim Notice (A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
potential liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1,
7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3, as

 



\- 53 -  the case may be, with respect to such third-party claim and (B) whether the
Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Person against such
third-party claim; _provided that_ , if the Indemnifying Party fails to so
notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice during the Election Period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected to dispute such liability
and not to defend against such third-party claim.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Party who sent the Claim Notice
within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 7.11(b),
7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3, as the case may be, (ii) will indemnify the
Indemnified Party therefrom (subject to the provisions and limitations of
Article XI and this Article XII) and (iii) elects to assume the defense of
such Indemnified Person with respect to such third-party claim, then, subject
to satisfaction of the Litigation Condition as set forth below, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
expense, such third-party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 12.4(b). Without limiting the other requirements
set forth herein for the Indemnifying Party to have the right to defend such
third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such
third-party claim only if such third-party claim does not involve criminal
liability and seeks only money damages and not equitable relief (the "
_Litigation Condition_ "). To the extent that the Indemnifying Party has the
right to defend such third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof;  _provided that_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third-party
claim in a manner) without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_that_ no such consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required with respect
to any such settlement agreement (or settling or comprising of any such third-
party claim in a manner) which does not provide for or result in any payment
by or liability of the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other
amount, any lien, charge or encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified
Person, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of the
Indemnified Person, any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any
business by the Indemnified Person or any equitable remedies against the
Indemnified Person. The Indemnified Person is hereby authorized, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified
Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to file, during the
Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings which the Indemnified
Person shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those
of the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected to be prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any such third-party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest, including the making of any related counterclaim or cross-complaint
against any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnified Person, if the Indemnified
Person is a Buyer Indemnified Person, or a Seller Indemnified Person, if the
Indemnified Person is a Seller Indemnified Person). The Indemnified Person
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any third-
party claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this

 



\- 54 -  Section 12.4(b), and the Indemnified Person shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation; _provided that_ if the
Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Person have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such third-party claim, then such reasonable costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Person shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party ( _provided that_ the Indemnifying Party shall only be
responsible for the fees and expenses of one firm of legal counsel for the
Indemnified Person, plus applicable local counsel). The prosecution of
the defense of a third-party claim with reasonable diligence shall include
the taking of such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or other
security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien
against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Person for payment
of such third-party claim.

(c) If the Litigation Condition is not met or if the Indemnifying Party (i)
fails to notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice within the Election Period
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Person pursuant
to Section 12.4(b) or (ii) elects to defend the Indemnified Person pursuant
to Section 12.4(b) but fails to prosecute the defense of (or to settle) the
third-party claim with reasonable diligence, then the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to defend the third-party claim and the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to
indemnification hereunder), the third-party claim by all
appropriate proceedings. The Indemnified Person shall have full control of
such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Person may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such third-party
claim, without the Indemnifying Partys express written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 12.4(c), and the Indemnifying
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

 

(d) If an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under Sections 5.1,
7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3 for a claim or other matter which does not
involve a third-party claim, and if Buyer or Sellers intend to seek indemnity
for itself or on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect thereto by or
from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 5.1, 7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2
and/or 12.3, then the Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of itself or
an Indemnified Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of such claim or
other matter, the Indemnified Persons reasonable estimate of the amount of
damages attributable to such claim or other matter and the basis for the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification under Sections 5.1,
7.11(b), 7.12, 12.2 and/or 12.3, as the case may be. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Party who sent such notice within thirty (30) days from
its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party does not dispute such
claim for indemnity, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have disputed
such claim.

 



\- 55 - 12.5 _Sellers  General Liability Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating
to Section 12.3 with respect to a breach by either or both Sellers of any
representation or warranty made by either or both Sellers in this Agreement
(excluding any representations or warranties of either or both Sellers set
forth in Section 12.1(b) and Section 12.1(c)) exceed an amount equal to ten
percent (10%) of the Purchase Price; _provided further_ , that in no event
shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating to Section 12.3
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price;

(ii) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 12.3
with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by either or
both Sellers in this Agreement (excluding any representations or warranties of
either or both Sellers set forth in Section 12.1(b) and Section 12.1(c))
unless and to the extent the aggregate amount which would otherwise be payable
by Sellers thereunder with respect to all such breaches exceeds an amount
equal to one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible Amount_
"), and in such event, Sellers shall be responsible for only the amount in
excess of the Deductible Amount; and

 

(iii) No Buyer Indemnified Person who is otherwise entitled to indemnification
under Section 12.3(a) shall be entitled to indemnification from any Seller
pursuant thereto unless Buyer (on behalf of itself or such other Buyer
Indemnified Person) asserts a claim in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 12.4 on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) The amount of any Covered Liabilities for which indemnification is
provided under this Article XII shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by an Indemnified Person under any agreements for insurance,
indemnification, guarantee or similar assurances in favor of the Company or
any Subsidiary or which may be included in the Assets with respect to such
Covered Liabilities (net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and any
increase in insurance premiums incurred in connection with such recovery).
Buyer shall use and shall cause each of its Affiliates to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under such agreements for
insurance, indemnification, guarantee or similar assurances for any Covered
Liabilities for which it is seeking indemnification under this Agreement. If
Buyer receives any amounts under applicable agreements for insurance,
indemnification, guarantee or similar assurances, subsequent to an
indemnification payment (in any manner contemplated by Section 12.5(c)) by
Sellers, then Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers for such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by Buyer, net of any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses and any increase in insurance premiums incurred by Buyer in
collecting such amount. Furthermore, the amount of any Covered
Liabilities for which indemnification is provided pursuant to Section 12.3
shall be computed net of any Tax credits or other Tax benefits actually
realized by a Buyer Indemnified Person in the taxable year in which such
Covered Liabilities are incurred or the succeeding taxable year.

 



\- 56 - (c) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a
payment obligation is owed by a Seller to a Buyer Indemnified Person on
account of the indemnification obligations contained in Section 12.3, such
payment shall be made in the following manner: (i) if the Note has not been
paid in full, then the then outstanding principal balance of the Note shall
be reduced by the amount owed by such Seller pursuant hereto; (ii) if the Note
has been paid in full or to the extent the amount owed by such Seller pursuant
to Section 12.3 exceeds the then outstanding principal balance of the Note
and a Security Escrow Deposit exists, Sellers and Buyer shall provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to disburse to such
Buyer Indemnified Person out of the Security Escrow Fund an amount equal to
the difference (or, if the Note has been paid in full, the total amount owed
by such Seller to such Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3);
and (iii) if no Security Escrow Deposit exists (or the amount of the Security
Escrow Fund is less than the amount owed by such Seller to such Buyer
Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3 that has not been funded by a
reduction in the outstanding principal balance of the Note), such Seller
shall be obligated to pay the amount owed by it that is not funded in the
manner provided in clause (i) and (ii) above in cash to such Buyer Indemnified
Person. Any reduction to the principal balance of the Note pursuant to clause
(i) above shall be effective as of the date such payment obligation on account
of the indemnification obligations contained in Section 12.3 is determined to
be owed by such Seller to a Buyer Indemnified Person and shall be evidenced
in writing executed and promptly delivered by Sellers to Buyer.

12.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in Section 7.6 and other than for
common law, actual fraud that is established by a Party to have occurred,
Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing Date,
the indemnification provisions of this Article XII are the sole and exclusive
remedy of Sellers and Buyer for the breach of any representation or warranty
or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of either Seller or
Buyer under this Agreement or confirmed in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, and Sellers do hereby release, acquit and forever discharge all Buyer
Indemnified Persons and Buyer does hereby release, acquit, and forever
discharge all Seller Indemnified Persons from any such other remedies.

shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party, and

releasing Buyers obligations under Article V and Section 7.11(b), the
Performance Deposit (together with all interest and other amounts earned
thereon) (and Buyer shall promptly deliver written instructions to the Escrow
Agent directing it to promptly release same to Sellers), as liquidated
damages. Except for the remedy provided in Section 13.2(c), such remedy shall
be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for such failure (including against the
Financing Parties), all other remedies being expressly waived by Sellers. If
the Closing does not occur for any reason, (i) Sellers and their Affiliates
will not seek to recover any money damages or seek any other remedy against
any Financing Party or any Related Party with respect to this Agreement, the

other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the Financing Parties and the
Related Parties will not seek to recover any money damages or seek any other
remedy against any Seller or its Affiliates with respect to this Agreement,
the Financing contemplated to be provided by the Financing Parties or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and Buyer agree upon the

inconvenience of measuring actual damages and the uncertainty thereof, and
Sellers and Buyer agree that such amount is a reasonable estimate of Sellers
loss in the event of any such failure by Buyer.

 

(b) _Buyer s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is terminated other than by Seller pursuant to

 



\- 59 -  Section 13.1(a)(iv), Buyer shall be entitled to receive back the Performance
Deposit (together with all interest and other amounts earned thereon) (and
Sellers shall promptly deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing it to promptly release same to Buyer). Except for the remedy
provided in Section 13.2(c), such remedy shall be Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy for such failure, all other remedies being expressly waived by Buyer.

(c) _Specific Performance_. So long as this Agreement has not been terminated,
each of Buyer and Sellers shall be entitled to enforce specific performance
of this Agreement. Without waiving or releasing Buyer from any of its other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
specific performance with respect to this Section 10.3(c) shall not require
Buyer to make a false statement in the officers certificate of Buyer. Without
waiving or releasing Sellers from any of their other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, specific performance
with respect to this Section 10.2(c) shall not require either Seller to make a
false statement in the officers certificate of such Seller.
