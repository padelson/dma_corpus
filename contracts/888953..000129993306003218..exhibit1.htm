 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_     

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of May 5, 2006, is
made by and among Online Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Online Resources Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Princeton eCom Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and a committee consisting of Lawrence
Mock, Steven Piaker and Manu Rana, solely in their capacities as
representatives of the Company Securityholders and the Incentive Plan
Participants pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Stockholder Representative"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Section 10.1, or in the applicable Section of this Agreement
to which reference is made in Section 10.1.   

 _RECITALS_ :    

WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a merger of the Merger Sub into the
Company and in such merger, the stockholders of the Company will receive cash
in exchange for their capital stock of the Company;   

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders to consummate the business combination provided for
herein;   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended to the
stockholders of the Company the adoption of this Agreement;   

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this
Agreement; and   

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain of the Companys stockholders, including Mellon Ventures, L.P.,
Conning Capital Partners and Lazard Technology Partners II LP (collectively,
the "Major Investors") are executing and adopting a stockholder consent
approving this Agreement and the transactions set forth herein, including
the Merger (the "Stockholder Consent") and the Stockholder Consent shall
constitute the Requisite Stockholder Approval.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER    

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Certificate of Merger in such form as is required by the relevant
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease
(the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub and the Company shall be converted or canceled in the
manner provided in Article II of this Agreement, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation following the Merger. Merger Sub and the Company are
sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent Corporations" and the
Company as the surviving corporation following the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation".   

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, Princeton, New
Jersey, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the Parties which shall be
no later than two (2) Business Days after satisfaction (or waiver as provided
herein) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature will be satisfied at the Closing), unless
another time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties. The
date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date". Simultaneously with the Closing, the Company as the surviving
corporation shall file the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective,
pursuant to the Certificate of Merger, at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is so filed, which time is hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time".   

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.   

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects
specified in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each of the Company and the Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   

(b) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation
shall read: "The name of this corporation is Princeton eCom Corporation".
Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to use a different name for the
Surviving Corporation. As so amended and restated, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until amended thereafter in accordance with
applicable Law.   

(c) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
(except that all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be changed to reflect the name change of Merger Sub), until
amended thereafter in accordance with applicable Law.   

(d) At the Effective Time, each of the directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective
death, permanent disability, resignation or removal or until his or her
respective successor is duly elected and qualified, all in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable Law.   

1.4 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or similar instruments are necessary or proper to vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its
right, title and interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties, assets, liabilities or other
obligations of either of the Constituent Corporations, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either Constituent Corporation, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments
and other similar instruments as may be necessary, desirable or proper to
vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties, assets, liabilities or other obligations of such
Constituent Corporation.   

ARTICLE II    

MERGER CONSIDERATION AND CONVERSION OF SECURITIES    

2.1 _Merger Consideration_.   

(a) _General_. The aggregate amount to be paid by Parent on the Closing Date
with respect to all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
and any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any securities of the
Company (including Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company Options and Company
Warrants) and with respect to the Incentive Plan Amounts shall equal (such
amount, the "Merger Consideration"): $180,000,000 _plus_ such increase
resulting from the excess Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i)
(provided, however, that it is agreed and acknowledged that the amount
actually payable to each Holder and Incentive Plan Participant is subject to
(i) reduction pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including reduction pursuant to Section 2.1(b) with
respect to a Working Capital Shortfall, Section 2.4(a) with respect to
Company Transaction Costs, Section 2.4(a)(i) with respect to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and Section 2.4(a)(ii) with respect to the
Stockholder Representative Escrow Amount) and (ii) increase by a total of
$10,000,000 pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1(c)).   

(b) _Working Capital Adjustment_. The Merger Consideration shall be subject
to adjustment on a dollar for dollar basis as set forth in this Section
2.1(b).   

(i) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement of the estimated Working Capital
as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Working Capital"). The Company shall
consult with the Parent regarding its calculation of Estimated Working
Capital prior to delivery of the statement of Estimated Working Capital. To
the extent that the Estimated Working Capital is less than $2,000,000 (the
"Target Working Capital"), the Merger Consideration payable at Closing will
be decreased by such shortfall. To the extent that the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Merger Consideration
payable at Closing will be increased by such excess.   

(ii) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Stockholder Representative (or its designee) a statement
(the "Working Capital Statement") setting forth the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital").   

(iii) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Working Capital Statement
(either as to content or manner of preparation), then the Stockholder
Representative shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Working Capital Statement from Parent, deliver a written notice to Parent of
such dispute setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for that dispute. If
the Stockholder Representative does not so notify Parent of a dispute within
such thirty (30) day period, the Closing Working Capital shall be deemed to
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. In the event the Stockholder
Representative delivers a notification of a dispute, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute; provided, however that if Parent and the Stockholder Representative
fail to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days after notification of
the dispute, then Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly
(but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter) engage
an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing (which shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and Stockholder
Representative) (the "Arbitration Firm") to resolve such dispute. Parent
shall be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Arbitration
Firm unless the Arbitration Firm finds the Closing Working Capital is the
same or less than the Closing Working Capital reflected in the Working
Capital Statement in which case the amount of all fees and expenses of the
Arbitration Firm shall be paid by Escrow Agent from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.
All determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. The Closing Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.1(b)(iii) shall be the "Final Working
Capital".   

(iv) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section
2.1(b), the Parties shall cooperate with and make available to the other
Parties and their respective representatives all information, records, data
and working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis
of the Estimated Working Capital and the Working Capital Statement and the
resolution of any disputes thereunder.   

(v) If the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital,
then, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted downward by the amount of
such shortfall (the "Working Capital Shortfall"), and the Escrow Agent shall
pay to Parent an amount of cash equal to such Working Capital Shortfall from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated in writing by Parent to the Escrow Agent; provided,
however that in no event shall Parent be entitled to any amounts in excess of
the amounts then available in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If the Final Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, then the Merger
Consideration shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and the Parent
shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount of cash equal to such excess by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in the
Exchange Agreement, which amounts shall then be distributed to the Holders in
accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement. Any such payment and
the payment of any Working Capital Shortfall is to be made within five (5)
Business Days of the date on which Final Working Capital is determined
pursuant to this Section 2.1(b).   

(c) Additional Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be increased by
$10,000,000 (the "Additional Merger Consideration") upon the occurrence of
the events set forth on Schedule 2.1(c) hereto.   

2.2 _Effect on Company Capital Stock_.   

(a) _Series A-1 Preferred Stock_. Unless converted to Common Stock in
accordance with the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of the
Company (including all rights attendant thereto) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to (A) the Series A-1 Preference Amount per share plus
(B) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Series A-1 Preferred Stock is convertible (without taking into account the
conversion of any accrued dividends in accordance with the Charter Documents)
and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration, subject to the terms of
this Agreement (including Section 2.4(a)).   

(b) _Series B-1 Preferred Stock_. Unless converted to Common Stock in
accordance with the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock of the
Company (including all rights attendant thereto) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to (A) the Series B-1 Preference Amount per share plus
(B) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Series B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible (without taking into account the

and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration, subject to the terms of
this Agreement (including Section 2.4(a)).   

(c) _Series C-1 Preferred Stock_. Unless converted to Common Stock in
accordance with the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each share of Series C-1 Preferred Stock of the
Company (including all rights attendant thereto) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,

Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to (A) the Series C-1 Preference Amount per share plus
(B) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Series C-1 Preferred Stock is convertible (without taking into account the
conversion of any accrued dividends in accordance with the Charter Documents)
and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration (the "Per Share C-1 Merger
Consideration"), subject to the terms of this Agreement (including Section
2.4(a)).   

(d) _Series D-1 Preferred Stock_. Unless converted to Common Stock in
accordance with the Charter Documents of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each share of Series D-1 Preferred Stock of the
Company (including all rights attendant thereto) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the

2.4 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
the following amounts by wire transfers of immediately available funds:   

(a) _Escrow Amounts_.   

(i) _Indemnity Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, a portion of the Merger
Consideration in an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be
deposited by Parent with the escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") designated in
the escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), substantially in the form of
_Exhibit A-1_ hereto, to be entered into at the Closing by Parent, the
Company, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent. At any time, the
amount of cash held by the Escrow Agent related to the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, together with any proceeds thereon (which shall be apportioned
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement), shall at such time constitute
the "Indemnity Escrow Funds" and shall be used to satisfy Losses of an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Article VIII and to fund any Working Capital
Shortfall pursuant to Section 2.1(b). The Escrow Agreement sets forth the
terms upon which disbursements shall be made by the Escrow Agent. The
Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be held in two separate funds: (i) to the
extent any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds are being funded from the
Merger Compensation Payments, such amounts shall be treated as an unfunded,
unsecured promise to pay, and shall be held in a separate grantor trust fund,
subject only to the claims of Parents creditors in the event of Acquirors
insolvency, according to "rabbi trust" terms substantially similar to those
approved by the IRS in Rev. Proc. 92-64, and shall be held and disbursed
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the applicable terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The Merger Compensation Payments Escrow shall be structured
so that the Merger Compensation Payments held in the Merger
Compensation Payments Escrow are not subject to income tax until
distributions are made from the Merger Compensation Payments Escrow provided,
however, in no event shall such structure terminate, reduce or otherwise
adversely modify, in any manner, the rights of the Indemnified Parties set
forth in the Escrow Agreement and (ii) in all other cases such amount shall
be held in a separate trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
any Person.   

(ii) _Stockholder Representative Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, a portion
of the Merger Consideration in an amount equal to the Stockholder
Representative Escrow Amount shall be deposited by Parent for a period of one
(1) year with the escrow agent (the "Stockholder Representative Escrow
Agent") designated in an escrow agreement (the "Stockholder
Representative Escrow Agreement"), in a form reasonably acceptable to both
parties which shall be attached hereto as _Exhibit A-2_, to be entered into
at the Closing by the Company, the Stockholder Representative and the
Stockholder Representative Escrow Agent. At any time, the amount of cash held
by the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agent, together with any proceeds
thereon (which shall be apportioned pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder
Representative Escrow Agreement), shall at all times constitute the
"Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds" and shall be used to satisfy all
costs and expenses of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 8.8.
The Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds shall be held shall be held in
two separate funds: (i) to the extent any portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Funds are being funded from the Merger Compensation Payments, such amounts
shall be treated as an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay, and shall be
held in a separate grantor trust fund, subject only to the claims of Parents
creditors in the event of Acquirors insolvency, according to "rabbi trust"
terms substantially similar to those approved by the IRS in Rev. Proc. 92-64,
and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance
with the applicable terms of the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agreement.
The Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund attributable to Merger
Compensation Payments shall be structured so that the Merger Compensation
Payments held in the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund attributable to
Merger Compensation Payments are not subject to income tax until
distributions are made from the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund
attributable to Merger Compensation Payments provided, however, in no event
shall such structure terminate, reduce or otherwise adversely modify, in any
manner, the rights of the Indemnified Parties set forth in the
Escrow Agreement and (ii) in all other cases such amount shall be held in a
separate trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Person.   

(b) _Remaining Merger Consideration_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit
of the Holders and the Incentive Plan Participants, the aggregate amount
of the Merger Consideration (including, for purposes of clarity, the
Management Incentive Amount) (such Merger Consideration, together with any
interest with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund") less the Indemnity Escrow Amount deposited with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(i) and less the Stockholder Representative Escrow
Amount deposited with the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 2.4(a)(ii) and any other adjustments to the Merger Consideration
required under this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions set forth in the Exchange Agent Agreement (the
"Exchange Agreement") substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (and
subject to Section 2.5(h) as to Merger Compensation Payments), deliver the
cash out of the Exchange Fund in exchange for the outstanding Company
Securities and in full satisfaction of the Management Incentive Amount.
The Exchange Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to
any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any Person. Except as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b), the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   

(c) _Company Transaction Costs_. The Company Securityholders shall be
responsible for payment of the Company Transaction Costs. To facilitate that
payment, the Parent shall cause such Company Transaction Costs to be paid
from the Merger Consideration at the Closing.   

2.5 _Exchange Procedures and Payment of Merger Consideration_. The Merger
Consideration shall be payable as follows:   

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of stock
certificates, options or warrants or other securities which, immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Securities
(collectively, the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent), substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(the "Transmittal Letter"), (ii) counterpart signature pages to
the Stockholder Representative Agreement, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "Stockholder Representative Agreement") and to the
Escrow Agreement and to the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agreement,
(iii) in the case of a Holder of a Company Option or Company Warrant, a duly
executed cancellation acknowledgement (a "Cancellation
Acknowledgement"), substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
and (iv) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for cash, in each case to the extent the Company has not
previously received such documents duly executed by the applicable Holder.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation,
together with such Transmittal Letter, Stockholder Representative Agreement,
Escrow Agreement, Stockholder Representative Escrow Agreement and the
Cancellation Acknowledgement, to the extent applicable (in each case to
the extent the Company has not previously received such documents duly
executed by the applicable Holder), each duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions
(collectively, the "Holder Documents"), the Holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount of cash which such
Holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Securities formerly
represented by such Certificates, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Company
Security which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
proper amount of cash may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Security is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by such documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by reasonable evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(a),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   

(b) _Exchange of Preferred Stock_. Regarding Holders of Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, a "Participating
Preferred Holder"), as soon as practicable after receipt by Exchange Agent of
a Participating Preferred Holders Certificates and applicable Holder
Documents executed and delivered in accordance with this Agreement,
Exchange Agent shall deliver to that Participating Preferred Holder the
amount of cash due to such Participating Preferred Holder for each share of
Preferred Stock held by such Participating Preferred Holder as of the
Effective Time as determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Section 2.2 (less such Participating Preferred Holders portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds and Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds).   

(c) _Exchange of Common Stock_. Regarding Holders of Common Stock issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time (each, a "Participating Common
Holder"), as soon as practicable after receipt by Exchange Agent of a
Participating Common Holders Certificates and applicable Holder Documents
executed and delivered in accordance with this Agreement, Exchange Agent
shall deliver to that Participating Common Holder the amount of cash due to
such Participating Common Holder for each share of Common Stock held by such
Participating Common Holder as of the Effective Time as determined in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.2 (less such
Participating Common Holders portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds and
Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds).   

(d) _Exchange of Preferred Warrants_. Regarding Holders of Preferred Warrants
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Participating
Preferred Warrant Holder"), as soon as practicable after receipt by Exchange
Agent of a Participating Preferred Warrant Holders Preferred Warrants and
applicable Holder Documents executed and delivered in accordance with
this Agreement, Exchange Agent shall deliver to that Participating Preferred
Warrant Holder the amount of cash due to such Participating Preferred Warrant
Holder for each Preferred Warrant held by such Participating Preferred
Warrant Holder as of the Effective Time as determined in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Section 2.3 (less such Participating Preferred
Warrant Holders portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds and Stockholder
Representative Escrow Funds), subject, in all cases, to the provisions of
Section 2.5(h).   

(e) _Exchange of Company Options and Common Warrants_. Regarding Holders of
Company Options or Common Warrants as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a "Participating Common Convertible Holder"), as soon as
practicable after receipt by Exchange Agent of a Participating Common
Convertible Holders Company Options or Common Warrants, as applicable,
and applicable Holder Documents executed and delivered in accordance with
this Agreement, Exchange Agent shall deliver to that Participating Common
Convertible Holder, an amount of cash due to such Participating Common
Convertible Holder for each Company Option or Common Warrant (as
applicable) held by such Participating Common Convertible Holder as of the
Effective Time as determined in accordance with the applicable provision of
Section 2.3(c) (less such Participating Common Convertible Holders portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Funds and Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds),
subject, in all cases, to the provisions of Section 2.5(h).   

(f) _Full Satisfaction_. All cash paid upon exchange of the Company
Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Securities.   

(g) _Undistributed Portions of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the Incentive Plan Participants or
holders of Company Securities for one (1) year after the Effective Time, and
all certificates or other documents in possession of the Exchange Agent
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be promptly delivered
to Parent, and the Exchange Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each
Incentive Plan Participant or holder of a Certificate representing Company
Securities (other than certificates representing Dissenting Shares) may
surrender such certificate (or in the case of Incentive Plan Participants,
such other documentation as set forth in Section 2.3(d)) to the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law) receive in consideration therefor, the Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without any interest thereon (except as otherwise set forth
in the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Representative
Agreement), calculated in accordance with this Section 2.5. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Securities or
Incentive Plan Participants as of a date which is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Holder or
Incentive Plan Participant for any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall not directly pay Merger Compensation
Payments to their recipients as contemplated by Section 2.3, but shall
instead transfer Merger Compensation Payments to the Surviving Corporation
for immediate payment to such recipients through the Surviving
Corporations payroll systems. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from Merger Compensation Payments and any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Taxes Law as determined by the Surviving Corporation in its reasonable
judgment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the
Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder (or Incentive Plan Participant, as applicable) in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be.   

(i) _Adoption of Agreement_. The adoption of this Agreement and the
Requisite Stockholder Approval constitutes approval of the Stockholder
Representative Agreement, the Exchange Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and of all of
the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds and the Stockholder Representative Escrow Funds in escrow and
the appointment of the Stockholder Representative.

into account the actual amount of Company Transaction Expenses) (iv) the
estimated amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and Stockholder Representative
Escrow Amount allocated to each Holder and each Incentive Plan Participant,

each Incentive Plan Participant as of the Effective Date. At the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to the Parent an updated _Schedule 2.6_ as of
the Closing Date which shall fully comply with the terms of the Charter
Documents of the Company and with the terms of the Management Incentive Plan
and the Company Options and Common Warrants.   

2.7 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock, Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by
Parent_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
following shall apply:   

(a) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of the Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or the
Company, be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   

(b) _Treasury Shares and Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub_. Each (i) share
of Company Stock held in the Companys treasury immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) Company Security owned beneficially by the Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall not represent the
right to receive any Merger Consideration, and each such security shall, as
of the Effective Time, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no cash, securities or other property shall be payable in respect thereof, in
each case without any conversion thereof pursuant to Sections 2.2 and
2.3.   

2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by the stockholders
of the Company who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply with
all of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and Parent shall retain the Merger Consideration
applicable to such Dissenting Shares, unless and until such Holders shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal under the DGCL; and any such Holder shall have only such
rights in respect of the Dissenting Shares owned by them as are provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such Holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such Holders Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration without any interest thereon, pursuant to the
terms of this Article II. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim made by the
stockholders of the Company with respect to the Dissenting Shares. Dissenting
Shares, if any, after payments of fair value in respect thereto have been
made to the holders thereof pursuant to applicable Law, shall be
canceled.   

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Escrow
Agreement, no interest will be paid or accrued on the amounts payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.5, each Certificate shall represent for all
purposes, only the right to receive the consideration pursuant to the terms
of Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.   

2.10 _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificates representing shares of
Company Securities or exercisable for Company Securities (as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall make such payment in
accordance with Section 2.5 in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Holder
thereof in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.   

2.11 _No Further Transfer of Shares_. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates for Company Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for cash as provided in this Article II. At the close of
business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company
shall be closed.

Contract as a result thereof (other than with respect to the Required
Consents to be obtained prior to Closing pursuant to Section 6.2(i)). Parent
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall
be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any such
consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or (c) any Action commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent or any such termination, except with
respect to the Required Consents to be obtained pursuant to Section 6.2(i).
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent, upon the
request of Parent, in any reasonable manner in connection with Parent
obtaining any such consents and waivers; provided that such cooperation shall
not include any requirement of the Company or any of its Affiliates to expend
money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party. Nothing in
this Section 5.2(d) shall constitute a waiver by Parent and Merger Sub of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(i) below.   

5.3 _Stockholder Approval_.   

(a) _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The Company has received the
Stockholder Consent from the Major Investors which constitutes the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall send, pursuant to Sections 228 and
262(d) of the DGCL, a written notice to all stockholders of the Company that
did not execute the Stockholder Consent informing them that this Agreement and
the Merger were adopted and approved by the stockholders of the Company and
that appraisal rights are available for their Company Stock pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (which notice shall include a copy of such Section
262).   

(b) _280G Payments_. The Company shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to
seek the necessary stockholder approval of any payments or benefits under any
Company Plan or other agreement which would be an "excess parachute payment"
under Section 280G of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall deliver to Parent reasonable evidence that (A)
the stockholder approval was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the necessary stockholder approval
was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject
to the stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (B) that the 280G Approval
was not obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall
not be made or provided, as authorized under the waivers of those payments
and/or benefits which were executed by all of the affected individuals.   

5.4 _Operation of Business_.   

(a) _Conduct of Business._ During the period from the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, except upon the written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), the Company shall maintain its corporate
existence, carry on its business in the Ordinary Course of Business, use
its Reasonable Best Efforts to preserve intact its material business
relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors and others having
business dealings with it, and to keep available the services of its officers
and key employees.   

(b) _Negative Covenants_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement (or
as otherwise required to comply with applicable Law) or as otherwise set
forth on Schedule 5.4, during the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, the Company shall not, without the consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld):   

(i) sell any property or assets having a value individually exceeding $150,000
or an aggregate value exceeding $300,000, except in the Ordinary Course of
Business;   

(ii) except in the Ordinary Course of Business, enter into any Contract that
would be required to be listed as a Material Contract if such Contract were
in effect on the date hereof or otherwise materially amend any existing
Material Contract (other than pursuant to the terms of this Agreement);   

(iii) make any capital expenditure or commit to make any capital expenditure
which in any one case exceeds $150,000 or capital expenditures which in the
aggregate exceed $300,000; provided that this restriction shall not apply to
capital expenditures that are in the Ordinary Course of Business;   

(iv) mortgage, pledge or subject to Security Interests, any material
properties or assets of the Company except pursuant to existing Contracts or
otherwise in the Ordinary Course of Business;   

(v) amend the Charter Documents;   

(vi) issue, amend the terms of, or declare or pay any dividend or make any
other payment or distribution with respect to, the Company Securities, other
than (i) pursuant to the terms of such Company Securities or other existing
Contracts of the Company, (ii) the issuance of certificates in replacement of
lost certificates or (iii) in order to fulfill its obligations
hereunder;   

(vii) (x) increase the wages, salaries, compensation, severance, pension or
other benefits payable to any employee, (y) pay any bonus or other amount to
any employee, or (z) modify in any material respect, or enter into any new,
employment, deferred compensation, severance, retirement or other agreement
or arrangement providing for additional or different benefits with any
employee, in each case other than (A) pursuant to existing Contracts or
Company Plans or (B) in the Ordinary Course of Business, with prior notice to
Parent or (C) in order to fulfill its obligations hereunder;   

(viii) adopt or amend in any material respect any Company Plan, except as
required by applicable Law; or   

(ix) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.   

5.5 _Access to Company Information_. Subject to the terms of that
certain Confidentiality Agreement between the Parent and the Company dated as
of February 15, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall
afford to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours prior to
the Closing, to the personnel, properties, books, Contracts and records of
the Company; provided that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
Company shall not be required to grant the foregoing access or furnish
the foregoing information to the extent that such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, would jeopardize an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege, or is prohibited by Law
or an existing Contract, (ii) Parent and its representatives shall not
have access to personnel records of the Company relating to individual
performance or evaluation records or medical histories (and Parent shall not
be entitled to conduct any invasive sampling or testing with respect to any
Person or the properties of any Person) and (iii) Parent and its
representative shall not have access to any other information that in the
Companys opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to subject the Company to risk of liability. In addition, Parent and
its representatives shall not contact any personnel of the Company
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the express
prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. All
information provided pursuant to this Agreement shall remain subject in all
respects to the Confidentiality Agreement. With respect to the exchange
of competitively sensitive information, including strategic and marketing
plans, pricing material and customer specific data, outside antitrust counsel
will be consulted prior to the exchange of such information, and such
information shall not be exchanged to the extent such counsel advises
against such exchange.   

5.6 _Notice of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give prompt written notice
to the other Party (either Parent or the Company, as appropriate) of: (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which causes any representation or warranty of such Party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior
to the Closing Date, and (b) any failure of such Party to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not (i) limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the Party receiving such notice
(except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.6 or Article VIII) or (ii)
constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement or
constitute an acknowledgement of materiality; provided further, however that
in the event the Company makes a disclosure under Section 5.6(a) of a
matter that the Company did not have knowledge of as of the date hereof and
if such matter would be a be a breach of a representation and warranty of the
Company that would give rise to Parents right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.1(b), and Parent proceeds with the Closing, then
such information shall constitute an amendment of the Disclosure Schedule,
representation, warranty or statement to which it relates for purposes of
this Agreement, and Parent and all other Indemnified Parties shall have
waived any right to indemnification for such breach under Article VIII.   

5.7 _Officer and Director Indemnification_.   

(a) _Existing Indemnification Protections_. The Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification set forth in the Charter Documents of the
Company (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing), for the benefit of
any individual who served as a director, officer, employee or other agent of
the Company or any of its Affiliates (or otherwise at the direction of the
Company) at any time prior to the Closing, and the Parent shall not (and the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not) take any action to alter
or impair any such exculpatory or indemnification provisions (whether now
existing in the Charter Documents of the Company or the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation), except for any changes which may be
required to conform with changes in applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the indemnification agreements
between the Company and any of its former directors, officers, employees or
other agents as in effect immediately prior to the Closing all of which are
identified in Section 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedule, and from and after the
Effective Time, such contractual obligations shall be the joint and several
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.   

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a directors
and officers liability insurance policy and other professional liability
insurance policies covering those persons who are currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy or such
other professional liability insurance policies (a copy of each of which has
been made available to the Parent) with coverage in amount and scope
substantially similar to the Companys existing coverage; provided that all of
the premiums and other costs of such insurance policy shall be paid from the
Merger Consideration.   

5.8 _Employment Matters_.   

(a) _General_. All employees of the Company as of the Effective Time,
including any such employees of the Company on approved leave of absence
(including maternity and paternity leave, vacation, sick leave, short-term or
long-term disability, military leave, jury duty and death leave) shall become
employees of the Surviving Corporation on the Effective Time
(the "Transitioned Employees"). Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause Transitioned Employees to commence participation in Parents
benefit programs. To the extent not prohibited under the applicable Parent
benefit plan, Parent will recognize Transitioned Employees years of service
with the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any benefit
plan of Parent and for purposes of seniority, vacation, personal time and
other similar general employment purposes; provided, that any vacation time
offered by Parent in the calendar year of the Effective Time to any
Transitioned Employee shall be offset by any vacation time used by or paid to
a Transitioned Employee by the Company in the calendar year of the Effective
Time. In addition, Parent will (a) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and service requirements with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Transitioned
Employees under any group health plan and other plans sponsored by Parent to
the extent not prohibited under such plans, except to the extent such
preexisting conditions, exclusion, waiting period or service requirement had
not been satisfied by any such Transitioned Employee as of the Effective Time
under a group health plan sponsored by the Company; and (b) provide each
Transitioned Employee with credit for any deductible, co-payment and out of
pocket limits applicable to such employees under any such group medical plan
or other plan sponsored by the Company and paid by the Transitioned Employee
prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year of the Effective Time.
Transitioned Employees of the Company as of the Effective Time shall be
permitted to participate in any Parent employee stock purchase plan, stock
option plans, savings plans, insurance plans and other similar plans
commencing on the first enrollment date following the Effective Time, subject
to compliance with the eligibility provisions of such plan (with employees
receiving credit, for purposes of such eligibility provisions, for service
with the Company) and the other applicable provisions of such plan.   

(b) _401(k) Distributions_. The Surviving Corporation shall, or Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause a distribution of vested account
balances from the Companys 401(k) plan, to each employee participating in
the plan who terminates employment with the Company and all ERISA Affiliates
after the Closing Date, as soon as administratively feasible following
such employees termination of employment, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law and the Companys 401(k) plan and not inconsistent with any
other contractual obligation of the Surviving Corporation or Parent;
provided, however, that this Section 5.8(b) shall not prohibit the
transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Companys 401(k) plan to a
401(k) plan of the Parent.   

(c) _Post-Closing Obligations and Severance_. After the Closing Date, Parent,
and subject to the accuracy and completeness of the Companys representations
and warranties under Section 3.19, the Surviving Corporation and each of
their respective Subsidiaries are and shall remain liable for, and Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for and shall promptly discharge, all liabilities, duties and
claims (to or by any of the Companys employees or former employees, any
beneficiary under any Employee Benefit Plan, any Governmental Entity or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to the employment relationship between
the Company and its employees and former employees, including
liabilities, duties and claims (i) for deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, retirement benefits, health and life benefits, severance
arrangements and benefits, disability benefits and other fringe benefits
under any Employee Benefit Plan, fund, program, arrangement, policy or
practice, (ii) relating to continuation health coverage pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA, (iii) for
unemployment and workers compensation or similar benefits and (iv) to file
any and all annual reports, filings or notices that may be required to be
filed with Governmental Entity or provided to participants and beneficiaries
after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, Parent agrees to provide each Transitioned
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or the applicable
Constituent Corporation during the one (1) year period immediately following
the Closing Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than
those provided to each Transitioned Employee under the applicable Company Plan
or other agreement in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent
further agrees to not reduce the base salary of any Transitioned Employee for
a period of one year following the Effective Time. Surviving Corporation
shall be liable for any severance, separation, deferred compensation or
similar benefits that are payable to any Transitioned Employee as a result of
the Merger. Nothing in this Section 5.8(c) shall be deemed a waiver of any
rights to indemnification Parent and Merger Sub may have under Article VIII
below.   

(d) _WARN Act_. Parent shall be responsible for providing any required notice
or pay in lieu of notice, and shall be liable for any liabilities, under the
WARN Act or any other Law, if applicable, respecting reductions in force or
mass layoffs, or the impact on employees of plant closings or sales of
businesses for any actions taken by Parent, the Constituent Corporations
or any of their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, including any
actions taken with respect to the Transitioned Employees.   

5.9 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation
of responsibility as between the Parent and the Company for certain Tax
matters following the Closing Date:   

(a) _Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Parent
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date which are filed after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns will be
prepared consistent with past practice of the Company except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall provide such Tax Returns
to the Stockholder Representative for its review and consent at least thirty
(30) days prior to their filing due date, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   

(b) _Tax Returns for Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date_. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns will be
prepared consistent with the past practices of the Company except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall provide such Tax Returns
to the Stockholder Representative for its review and consent at least thirty
(30) days prior to their filing due date, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   

(c) _Tax Periods Straddling the Closing Date_. For the purpose of this
Agreement, including Section 3.9, in the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company
for the period beginning with the day following the end of the most
recent taxable period and ending as of the Closing Date (but including the
Closing Date) (the "Pre-Close Short Period") shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(as if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date)
and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Close Short Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period.   

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party and at Parents sole cost and expense, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes for the Straddle Period, Pre-Close Short Period, or any earlier taxable
period of the Company and the Company shall not amend any Tax Return
encompassing any of the foregoing taxable periods or make any elections as to
such periods without obtaining the consent of the Stockholder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon another partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder, to the extent reasonably available to
such party. Parent agrees (i) to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Entity and (ii) to give the Stockholder Representative reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the Stockholder Representative so requests, to allow the
Stockholder Representative to take possession of such books and records.   

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent will be liable for transfer (including real
property transfer and stock transfer), documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including, without limitation,
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document up to a maximum of $50,000. Unless prohibited
by applicable Law, Parent shall be responsible for preparing and filing any
Tax Return relating to such Taxes and shall give to the Stockholder
Representative a copy of such Tax Return as filed, together with proof of
payment of the Tax shown thereon, promptly after filing. The Parties
hereto will cooperate with each other to make any such necessary filings and,
to the extent reasonably requested and legally permitted, to minimize any
such Taxes.   

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Escrow Amounts_.   

(i) For all Tax purposes, the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be treated as
owned by Parent unless and until released to the Holders and Incentive Plan
Participants pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, so that all
interest or other income earned from the investment of the Indemnity Escrow
Amounts before release to the Holders or Incentive Plan Participants,
as applicable, shall be considered for tax purposes to be income of the
Parent and the Escrow Agent shall report such interest or other income
consistently therewith, and, except as required by applicable law, shall not
take any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return or in
any administrative or judicial proceeding. Parent and Company agree to take
all necessary steps to structure the Indemnity Escrow Amount arrangement to
comply with section 409A of the Code and the proposed regulations
thereunder.   

(ii) The Escrow Agent shall release to Parent, at least ten (10) calendar days
before any Tax payment is due by Parent that includes in its calculation
interest or other income earned from the investment of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Funds equal to the Taxes on such
interest or other income.   

(iii) The release of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the Holders
or Incentive Plan Participants (as the case may be) shall be treated as
additional consideration paid, on the date of the release from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds and on behalf of Parent pursuant to this Agreement in exchange
for Company Securities or in discharge of the obligation to make the
payments of the Management Incentive Amount (as the case may be); provided,
however, that a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount so released shall be
characterized and treated as interest paid to the Holders or the Incentive
Plan Participants (as the case may be) equal to the amount, with respect to
the cash released, that is required to be treated as interest to the Holders
or the Incentive Plan Participants (as the case may be) pursuant to Section
1272 of the Code.   

5.10 _Public Announcements_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company, nor
shall any of their respective Affiliates, without the approval of the other
Party, issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be
required by applicable Law, including federal securities laws, or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or stock market, in which case the Party required to make the
release or announcement shall allow the other Party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance and
to consider such comments in good faith; provided that each of the Parties
may make internal announcements to their respective employees, and the
Company may make announcements to its customers, in each case regarding a
general description of the Merger or that are otherwise consistent with the
Parties prior public disclosures regarding the Merger.   

5.11 _Financing_. Parent agrees not to take any action between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to make
the Financing unavailable for any reason.   

5.12 _Expenses_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide the amount, in the aggregate, of all Company
Transaction Costs that are to be paid or caused to be paid at Closing and
shall provide Parent with (a) the identity of each Person that is to be paid
at Closing; (b) total amount owed or to be owed to each such Person as of
the Closing; and (c) the bank account and wire transfer information for each
such Person. Except as otherwise set forth herein (including as set forth in
Article VIII, Section 5.2(a) and this Section 5.12) or as set forth in the
Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agreement, each of
the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses (including legal and
accounting fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement (and
the other Transaction Documents) and the transactions contemplated hereby
(and thereby).   

5.13 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof
each of the Parties hereto shall execute such documents and other instruments
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) the Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Company in the event the Company is in breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such breach (i) individually or
in combination with any other such breach, would cause the conditions set
forth in clauses 6.2(a) or 6.2(a) not to be satisfied in all
material respects and (ii) is not cured or waived within the earlier of (x)
sixty (60) days following delivery by the Parent to the Company of written
notice of such breach, or (y) the date set forth in Section 7.1(d);   

(c) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Parent in the event the Parent or the Merger Sub is in breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such
breach (i) individually or in combination with any other such breach, would
cause the conditions set forth in clauses 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) not to be satisfied
in all material respects and (ii) is not cured or waived within the earlier
of (x) sixty (60) days following delivery by the Company to the Parent of
written notice of such breach, or (y) the date set forth in Section
7.1(e);   

(d) the Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Company if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 15, 2006 by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 6.1 or 6.2
(unless the failure results from a breach by the Parent or the Merger Sub of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement); or   

(e) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 15, 2006 by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 6.1 or 6.3
(unless the failure results from a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).   

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement (and the other Transaction Documents)
shall immediately become void and there shall be no liability or obligation
on the part of the Company or Parent or their respective officers, directors,
stockholders or Affiliates, except as set forth in Section 7.3; provided,
however, that (i) the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) the provisions of
Section 5.10 (Public Announcements) and Section 7.3 (Remedies) and Article IX
of this Agreement and the last sentence of Section 5.2(a) shall remain in
full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.   

7.3 _Remedies_. Any Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(b) or (c) shall have the right to recover damages sustained by such Party
as a result of any such breach, or as a result of fraud or willful
misrepresentation by the other Party; provided, however, that the Party
seeking relief is not in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement (or the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party) under circumstances which would have permitted the other
Party to terminate the Agreement under the applicable subsection of Section
7.1.   

ARTICLE VIII    

INDEMNIFICATION    

8.1 _Indemnification_. To the extent provided in this Article VIII, from and
after the Closing Date, the Company Securityholders and the Incentive Plan
Participants (each, an "Indemnifying Party"), acting through the Stockholder
Representative, shall, severally, but not jointly, indemnify Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, members and managers
(each, an "Indemnified Party") and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims (including third party
claims), charges, interest, penalties, taxes, costs and expenses (including
legal fees) (collectively, "Losses") resulting from, arising out of,
or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with, or otherwise with
respect to:   

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (to which Company is a
party) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to Closing; or   

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party and which
is required to be performed by the Company prior to Closing.   

8.2 _Procedure for Claims_.   

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party
would be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against an
Indemnified Party by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but
in no event later than twenty (20) days after notice thereof) notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand (the "Claim Notice"), specifying
the nature of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount
thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive
of the final amount of such claim or demand). The Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not the
Indemnifying Party disputes the Indemnifying Partys liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder for Losses with respect to such claim or demand
and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party does not dispute such liability, whether or
not the Indemnifying Party desires to defend against such claim or demand,
provided that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized (but not obligated)
prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or other
pleading and to take any other action which the Indemnified Party shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified Partys interests. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the Indemnifying
Partys obligation to indemnify hereunder and desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim or demand then, except as
hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
(with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) such claim or
demand; provided that, unless the Indemnified Party otherwise agrees in
writing, the Indemnifying Party may not settle any matter (in whole or
in part) unless such settlement includes a complete and unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in,
but not control, any such defense or settlement the Indemnified Party may do
so at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, whether by not
giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise,
then the Indemnified Party, without waiving any rights against the
Indemnifying Party, may settle or defend against any such claim in the
Indemnified Partys sole discretion and, if it is ultimately determined that
the Indemnifying Party is responsible therefor under this Article VIII, then
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying
Party the amount of any settlement or judgment and all indemnifiable costs
and expenses of the Indemnified Party with respect thereto.   

(b) If at any time, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, notice
of which shall be given in writing to the Indemnifying Party, any such claim
or demand seeks material prospective non-monetary relief which could have a
materially adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations,
assets, properties or condition, financial and otherwise, of any
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control or
assume (as the case may be) the defense of any such claim or demand and the
amount of any judgment or settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses of
defense shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnified Party should elect to
exercise such right, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own
expense, to participate in, but not control, the defense of such claim or
demand. If the Indemnifying Party should elect to exercise such right to
participate, the Indemnifying Partys consent shall be required for any
settlement of any such claim or demand, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   

(c) In the event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being
asserted against or sought to be collected by a third party, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes such
claim, the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder.   

(d) The Indemnified Partys failure to give reasonably prompt notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any actual, threatened or possible claim or demand
which may give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have
to the Indemnified Party unless the failure to give such notice adversely
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.   

8.3 _Payment of Indemnification Obligations_. Except with respect to claims
based on fraud, the release of Indemnity Escrow Amounts from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy for Losses
available to the Indemnified Parties for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, and any and all other matters arising out of,
relating to or connected with this Agreement (or any other Transaction
Document), the Company (including its assets and liabilities) and the Company
Securities, in each case in accordance with this Article VIII. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Indemnifying Party shall have any
liability to an Indemnified Party in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than such Indemnifying Partys pro rata share of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Merger Sub and Parent, on behalf of
themselves and the other Indemnified Parties (including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation), hereby waive, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) which such Indemnified Party may
have against the Company or any Indemnifying Party arising under or based
upon any Law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article VIII). If there should be a dispute as to
the amount of Losses, such portion, if any, of the obligation as shall not be
subject to dispute, shall be paid to the Indemnified Party from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds. At and after such time as the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
exhausted or released, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
seek indemnity under this Article VIII, and the Indemnified Party shall have
no further recourse against any Person for such unpaid Losses of any
Indemnified Party except with respect to claims based on fraud.   

8.4 _Survival_.   

(a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in the
other Transaction Documents, or in any certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1)
year.   

(b) The covenants and agreements which by their terms do not contemplate
performance after the Closing shall terminate as of the Closing. The
covenants and agreements which by their terms contemplate performance after
the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms
until sixty (60) days following the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations; provided that any such covenant or agreement which expires on a
date certain shall survive until such date certain.   

(c) The period for which a representation or warranty, covenant or agreement
survives the Closing is referred to herein as the "Applicable Survival
Period". In the event a Claim Notice for indemnification under Section 8.2 is
given within the Applicable Survival Period, the representation or warranty,
covenant or agreement that is the subject of such indemnification claim shall
survive with respect to such claim until such claim is finally resolved.   

8.5 _Certain Limitations_.   

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no liability or obligations under Section
8.1, in all cases, unless and until the amount of the aggregate
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under Section 8.1
exceeds $1,250,000 whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify, defend,
protect and hold harmless the Indemnified Party for the amount of all Losses
under Section 8.1 in excess of $1,250,000; subject in all cases to the other
limitations set forth in this Article VIII (including, that the liability of
the Indemnifying Parties under this Article VIII shall be limited to their
interest in the Indemnity Escrow Funds). In addition, in no event shall any
Company Securityholder or Incentive Plan Participant have any liability to
any Indemnified Party or any other Persons for fraud in excess of the portion
of the Merger Consideration received by such Person in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.   

(b) The amount of Losses recoverable by any Indemnified Party under this
Article VIII with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the
amount of any payment actually received by such Indemnified Party (or an
Affiliate thereof) from any insurance policy net of any deductibles or other
amounts payable with respect thereto.   

(c) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Section 8.5 and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect
to (i) any item disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule or pursuant to Section
5.6, (ii) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages claimed by an Indemnified Party resulting from the breach of
any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement, (iii) any covenant or
condition waived in writing by Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the
Closing, or (iv) any Loss by an Indemnified Party with respect to any matter
to the extent that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the
adjustment of the Merger Consideration, if any, pursuant to Sections
2.1(b).   

(d) Except with respect to claims for equitable relief, including specific
performance, made with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement (or the other Transaction Documents), from and
after the Closing the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article
VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective Affiliates with respect to claims under, or otherwise
relating to the transactions that are the subject of, this Agreement (and the
other Transaction Documents). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any Indemnified Party, its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to seek rescission of the transactions
consummated by this Agreement (or the other Transaction Documents).   

8.6 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.   

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made its
own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its businesses and
operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have been furnished with or given
full access to such information about the Company and its businesses and
operations as they requested. In connection with Parents and Merger Subs
investigation of the Company and its businesses and operations, Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective representatives have received from the
Company or its representatives certain projections and other forecasts for
the Company and certain estimates, plans and budget information. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets;
(ii) Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties; and
(iii) Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their
own evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or their representatives.
Nothing in this Section 8.6 shall be deemed to release, waive or alter any of
the Companys representations, warranties and covenants under this Agreement
or under the other Transaction Documents.   

(b) PARENT AND MERGER SUB EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING IN SECTION 3 HEREOF AND THE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE, AND IN THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, THERE ARE NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY THE COMPANY
OR ANY OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING (I) WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY, ITS ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE COMPANY SECURITIES
OR (II) AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE
COMPANY FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THERE ARE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and except for fraud, Indemnified
Parties shall have no claim or right to indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII or otherwise, and none of the Indemnifying Parties or any
other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to Merger Sub, Parent,
the Indemnified Parties or any other Person, with respect to (i) any
information, documents or materials furnished or made available by the
Company or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors
to Parent or Merger Sub, in certain "data rooms", management presentations or
any other form in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
(ii) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenue, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or the
future business, operations or affairs of the Company heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates.   

8.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to Merger Consideration.   

8.8 _Stockholder Representative and Adoption of Provisions_.   

(a) By virtue of the Merger, each Company Securityholder and each Incentive
Plan Participant hereby appoints Stockholder Representative as its exclusive
agent and attorney-in-fact to act on its behalf with respect to any claims,
controversies, or disputes arising out of the terms of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents (including the Escrow Agreement), including (i)
any dispute arising under Sections 2.1(b) or 5.9 of this Agreement; and (ii)
defending all indemnity claims, consenting to, compromising or settling all
indemnity claims, and otherwise acting pursuant to Article VIII; and all
actions taken by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the
foregoing appointment and authority shall be binding upon each Company
Securityholder and each Incentive Plan Participant and his successors and
assigns as if expressly ratified and confirmed in writing by each Company
Securityholder and each Incentive Plan Participant. Each Company
Securityholder and each Incentive Plan Participant further agrees that the
Stockholder Representative shall have the power to (a) receive all notices
and communications directed to the Stockholder Representative or the Company
with respect to any claims, controversies, or disputes arising out of the
terms of this Agreement (or the other Transaction Documents, including the
Escrow Agreement) and to take any action or no action in connection therewith
as it may deem appropriate, and (b) to take any action (or determine to take
no action) with respect to the foregoing appointment and authority as it
may deem appropriate as effectively as the Company or Company Securityholder
or Incentive Plan Participant could act itself, including the settlement or
compromise of any dispute or controversy under the indemnification provisions
hereof, the Escrow Agreement or any other document entered into in connection
herewith. The authority granted hereunder is deemed to be coupled with
an interest. Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to rely on any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative as
being the act or omission of the Company Securityholders or the Incentive
Plan Participants, without the need for any inquiry. The Company
Securityholders and the Incentive Plan Participants agree that the
Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to the Company
Securityholders or the Incentive Plan Participants for any loss, damage
or liability which they may incur as a result of any action taken in good
faith hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under any other document
entered into in connection herewith, and the Company Securityholders and the
Incentive Plan Participants, severally, but not jointly, agree to
indemnify and hold the Stockholder Representative free and harmless against
any and all loss, damage or liability which the Stockholder Representative
may sustain as a result of any action taken in good faith hereunder, under
the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative Escrow Agreement
or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, including
any legal fees and expenses (including any expenses for which the Stockholder
Representative is responsible under the Escrow Agreement). The Stockholder
Representative Escrow Funds shall be used to pay all such costs, expenses and
liabilities incurred by the Stockholder Representative.   

(b) In the event that the Stockholder Representative gives notice to Parent
and the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement that he disputes the
claim for indemnity that is subject to the Claim Notice, the dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and no amounts
shall be dispersed to an Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
until resolution of such dispute.   

(c) The adoption of this Agreement by the Company Securityholders and
Incentive Plan Participants constitutes approval of the indemnification
obligations of the Company Securityholders and Incentive Plan Participants
set forth in this Article VIII.   

(d) Additional rights and obligations of the Stockholder Representative are
more fully described in the Stockholder Representative Agreement.

the Stockholder Representative in his capacity as such shall require the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.   

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or privilege

(c) To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (i) no waiver that may be given by
a party shall be applicable except in the specific instance for which it was
given and (ii) no notice to or demand on one party shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or the right of the party giving such
notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand.   

9.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the
foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to

9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto
shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws

other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.   

9.5 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the State of Delaware, and (b) the United
States District Court located in the State of Delaware, for the purposes of
any Action arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated

with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this
Section 9.5. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the State of Delaware, or (ii)

unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.   

9.11 _Specific Performance_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions

hereof and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the
