 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Purchase and Sale of Assets_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Bill of Sale and the Master Participation Agreement and the
Freddie Mac I/O Strip Assignment Agreement which set forth the Purchased
Assets being sold to the TRS and the Partnership, respectively, the Seller
shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer,
in reliance on the representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller
contained herein, shall purchase from the Seller, all of the Sellers right,
title and interest, direct or indirect, in and to all assets, properties and
rights of every nature, kind and description, whether tangible or intangible,
real, personal or mixed, accrued or contingent (including goodwill), wherever
located and whether now existing or hereafter acquired prior to the Closing
Date, used or held for use primarily in connection with the Included Business
as the same shall exist on the Closing Date, whether or not carried or
reflected on or specifically referred to in the Sellers books or financial
statements or in the Disclosure Schedules hereto, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, other than the Excluded Assets (collectively, the " _Purchased Assets_
"), in each case free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances, including without limitation all of the Sellers right, title
and interest in and to the assets set forth in _Schedule 2.1_ of the
Disclosure Schedules. For the avoidance of doubt, the Excess Servicing Strip
and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip are being sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned
and delivered solely to the Partnership (and not the TRS) pursuant to this
Agreement and the Master Participation Agreement with respect to the Excess
Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip Assignment Agreement with
respect to the Freddie Mac I/O Strip.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Excluded Assets_. The Seller is not selling, and the Buyer is
not buying, any of the assets of the Seller set forth on _Schedule 2.2_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Excluded Assets_ "). The Seller shall retain all
rights to the Excluded Assets and the Buyer shall have no right to any part of
the Excluded Assets.

 



 

Section 2.3. _Assumed Liabilities_. In connection with purchase and sale of
the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement, at the Closing, and subject
to the terms and conditions of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the
Master Participation Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip Assignment Agreement which set forth the Assumed
Liabilities being assumed by the TRS and the Partnership, respectively, the
Buyer shall assume only the following liabilities and obligations of the
Seller related to the Purchased Assets (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "):

 



 

(a) all liabilities and obligations recorded on the Carve-Out Financial
Statements and in the footnotes thereto (other than as set forth in _Section
2.4(a)  (e))_;

 



 

(b) all liabilities and obligations related to the Mortgage Loans incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
Balance Sheet Date;

 



 

(c) all liabilities and obligations under the Assumed Credit Agreements;

 



 

(d) all liabilities and obligations of the Seller under the Seller Contracts
that are transferred to the Buyer hereunder or for which the Buyer is
receiving the benefits thereof pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_;

 



 

(e) all liabilities and obligations under the Agency Agreements that are
transferred to the Buyer hereunder or for which the Buyer is receiving the
benefits thereof pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_;

 



 

(f) all liabilities and obligations related to the Transferred Employees,
including any liabilities and obligations under any Seller Benefit Plans;

 



 

(g) all liabilities and obligations of the Seller under leases for the Leased
Real Property that are transferred to the Buyer hereunder or for which the
Buyer is receiving the benefits thereof pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_; and

 



 

(h) all liabilities and obligations set forth on _Schedule 2.3(h)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 2.3_ or any other provision of this Agreement, any Schedule or
Exhibit hereto or any Ancillary Agreement to the contrary, and regardless of
any disclosure to the Buyer, except for the Assumed Liabilities, the Buyer
shall not assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge (and
the Seller shall retain, pay, perform or otherwise discharge without recourse
to the Buyer) any liabilities or obligations of the Seller of any kind,
character or description whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, known or
unknown, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, and currently existing
or hereinafter arising (the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "), including the
following:

 



 

(a) all Taxes described in _Section 6.2_ and all Transfer Taxes imposed by
Law upon the Seller;

 



 

(b) any liabilities for tax distributions to the members of the Seller;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) any indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantees thereof outstanding as
of the Closing Date, except pursuant to the Assumed Credit Agreements as set
forth in the Carve-Out Financial Statements;

 



 

(d) any liability or obligation of the Seller arising from or relating to an
Excluded Asset, whether arising prior to or after the Closing Date; and

 



 

(e) any liability or obligation incurred by the Seller or any Person other
than the Buyer, Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries arising out of or
relating to the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (including fees and expenses payable to all attorneys and
accountants, other professional fees and expenses and bankers, brokers or
finders fees for persons not engaged by the Buyer).

 



 

Section 2.5. _Consents and Waivers; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall be construed
as an agreement to assign any Seller Contract, Permit, Right or other
Purchased Asset that by its terms or pursuant to applicable Law is not capable
of being sold, assigned, transferred or delivered without the consent or
waiver of a third party or Governmental Authority unless and until such
consent or waiver shall be given. The Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and the Buyer and Parent shall cooperate reasonably with
the Seller, to obtain such consents and waivers and to resolve the impediments
to the sale, assignment, transfer or delivery contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements and to obtain any other consents and waivers
necessary to convey to the Buyer all of the Purchased Assets. In the event any
such consents or waivers are not obtained prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
relevant consents or waivers until such consents or waivers are obtained, and
the Seller will cooperate with the Buyer in any lawful and economically
feasible arrangement to provide that the Buyer shall receive the interest of
the Seller in the benefits under any such Seller Contract, Permit, Right or
other Purchased Asset, including performance by the Seller, if economically
feasible, as agent; _provided_ that the Buyer shall undertake to pay or
satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the
extent the Buyer would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such
consents or waivers had been obtained. Nothing in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall
affect the Parties right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 9.1_ in
the event that any consent or waiver as described herein is not obtained.

 



 

(b) From time to time, whether before, at or following the Closing, the Seller
and the Buyer shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions and releases and such other instruments, and
shall take such further actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to assure
fully to the Buyer all of the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates,
remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to the Buyer under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to assure fully to the Seller
the assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by
the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to
otherwise make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.6. _Consideration; Form of Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Consideration_. In full consideration for the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Buyer
shall, (i) pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price,
which shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this _Article II_ and
subject to such allocation between the TRS and the Partnership set forth in
_Section 2.6(c)_ (as adjusted following the Closing pursuant to _Section
2.8(h)_), and (ii) assume the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) _Form of Consideration_. At the Closing, and subject to _Section
2.6(c)_, the Buyer shall pay the Closing Purchase Price to the Seller as
follows: (i) 50% of the Closing Purchase Price in cash and, if applicable
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.14_, Preferred Equity Interests
(collectively, the " _Non-Unit Consideration_ ") via, in the case of cash, a
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account specified by the
Seller at least 3 Business Days prior to Closing and (ii) 50% of the Closing
Purchase Price through the issuance of Buyer OP Units (the " _Unit
Consideration_ "), to be allocated between ACM and ACF as designated by the
Seller, as set forth in this _Section 2.6(b)_. The number of Buyer OP Units
issuable at the Closing shall be that number of Buyer OP Units which shall be
convertible in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement as of
the Closing Date into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock calculated
by dividing (X) 50% of the Closing Purchase Price and (Y) the Reference Market
Value of Parent Common Stock. " _Reference Market Value_ " means $6.50.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Consideration_. At the Closing, Unit Consideration shall be
paid for the Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip, and Non-
Unit Consideration shall be paid for the Purchased Assets (other than the
Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip), subject to the
following adjustments (and subject to adjustment following the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.8(h)_):

 



 

(i) if the value of the Estimated Closing Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie
Mac I/O Strip is less than fifty percent (50%) of the Closing Purchase Price
(such deficit, the " _Estimated Deficit Amount_ "), the Partnership shall
issue and contribute to the TRS Buyer OP Units having a value (based on the
Reference Market Value) equal to the Estimated Deficit Amount and the TRS
shall pay such Buyer OP Units (together with the Non-Unit Consideration) to
the Seller in exchange for the Purchased Assets (other than the Excess
Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip); and

 



 

(ii) if the value of the Estimated Closing Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie
Mac I/O Strip is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the Closing Purchase
Price (such excess, the " _Estimated Excess Amount_ "), the Partnership shall
pay a portion of the Non-Unit Consideration equal to the Estimated Excess
Amount (together with the Unit Consideration) to the Seller in exchange for
the Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Estimated Excess Amount shall be paid in cash and not
Preferred Equity Interests.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) If between the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Parent should
split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify Parent Common
Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common
Stock, or otherwise change Parent Common Stock into any other securities, or
make any other such stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of Parent
in respect of Parent Common Stock, then any number or amount contained herein
which is based upon the price of Parent Common Stock or the number of fraction
of shares of Parent Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Closing_.

 



 

(a) The sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a

Section 2.8. _Adjustment of Closing Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Adjustment to Closing Purchase Price_. Pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 2.8_ the " _Closing Purchase Price_ " shall be
calculated as follows: (i) the Base Purchase Price, plus or minus (ii) any
adjustment necessary with respect to the Acquired Servicing Portfolio on the
date of Closing (the " _Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio_ ") in accordance
with Exhibit H, plus or minus (iii) any adjustment necessary with respect to
the Weighted Average Servicing Fee in accordance with Exhibit H, plus (v) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Excess Amount, if any, minus (vi) the Estimated
Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, if any. On or prior to the third
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and deliver
to the Buyer a statement (the " _Seller Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Sellers good faith estimate, which shall be prepared and calculated in
the manner and on a basis consistent with the applicable definitions thereof,
of (i) the Net Working Capital and any required adjustments to the Base
Purchase Price, calculated in accordance with _Exhibit A_ (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio
and any required adjustments to the Base Purchase Price, calculated in
accordance with _Exhibit H_ (the " _Estimated Closing Acquired Servicing
Portfolio_ "), (iii) the Weighted Average Servicing Fee and any required
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price, calculated in accordance with _Exhibit
H_ (the " _Estimated Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee_ ") and (iv) the
Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac I/O Strip (the " _Estimated Closing
Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip_ "), and the components
thereof. If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the
Target Net Working Capital, such excess amount shall be the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital Excess Amount_." If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the difference shall be the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount_." The Parties acknowledge
and agree that it is the Parties intent and expectation that the Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date be as close as possible to the Target Net
Working Capital. During the period from and including the date hereof, and
prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to,

 



      
 

 



 

provide to the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the books
and records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries and to any other information of
the Seller and its Subsidiaries (to the extent permitted by applicable Law),
including work papers of their respective accountants (to the extent permitted
by such accountants), and to any of the Sellers or its Subsidiaries premises
during regular business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the extent
necessary for the Buyer to verify the amounts set forth in the Seller Closing
Statement, in each case to the extent provided in _Section 5.2_.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment to Closing Purchase Price_. Within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer (under the direction and
supervision of the Special Committee) shall cause to be prepared and delivered
to the Seller a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, as of
the Reference Time, the Net Working Capital, the Closing Acquired Servicing
Portfolio, the Weighted Average Servicing Fee, the Excess Servicing Strip and
the Freddie Mac I/O Strip, and the components thereof. The Closing Statement
and the Net Working Capital, the Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio, the
Weighted Average Servicing Fee, the Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie Mac
I/O Strip set forth therein shall be prepared and calculated in good faith,
and, as applicable, in the manner and on a basis consistent with the
applicable definitions thereof and _Exhibits A_ and _H_ , and shall be in the
same form and include the same line items as the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital calculation, the Estimated Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio
calculation, the Estimated Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee calculation
and the Estimated Closing Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip
calculation. If the Closing Statement is not so timely delivered, the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Acquired
Servicing Portfolio, the Estimated Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee and
Estimated Closing Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip will be
deemed Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio,
the Final Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee and the Final Closing Excess
Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip, respectively, absent manifest error
or fraud.

 



 

(c) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller will have sixty (60)
calendar days to review the Closing Statement. Unless the Seller delivers
written notice (which notice shall include the items and amounts in dispute
and supporting documentation related thereto; such notice, a " _Seller Dispute
Notice_ ") to the Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail the specific items
disputed by the Seller in good faith with respect thereto, and the specific
basis for each such objection, on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) calendar day
after the Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller will be deemed
to have accepted and agreed to the Closing Statement and such statement (and
the calculations contained therein) will be final, binding and conclusive,
absent manifest error or fraud. If the Seller delivers to the Buyer a Seller
Dispute Notice within such sixty (60) calendar day period, the Buyer (under
the direction and supervision of the Special Committee) and the Seller shall,
during the thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such Seller Dispute
Notice by the Seller to the Buyer (or such longer period as they may mutually
agree in writing) (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences with respect to the disputed items (or calculations)
in such Seller Dispute Notice (the " _Disputed Items_ "), and all other items
(and all calculations relating thereto) will be final, binding and conclusive,
absent manifest error or fraud. Any resolution by the Buyer (with the approval
of the Special Committee) and the Seller during the Resolution Period as to
any Disputed Item

 



      
 

 



 

shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding and conclusive,
absent manifest error or fraud.

 



 

(d) If the Buyer and the Seller do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end
of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining in dispute will be
submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator pursuant to an engagement letter
reasonably acceptable to the Seller and the Buyer. The Neutral Arbitrator
shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those Disputed Items remaining in
dispute, consistent with this _Section 2.8_, and shall request a statement
from the Buyer and the Seller regarding such Disputed Items. The scope of the
disputes to be arbitrated by the Neutral Arbitrator is limited to those items
or calculations specifically in dispute between the Buyer and the Seller; and
the Neutral Arbitrator is not to make any other determination, including not
making any determination as to whether the Closing Statement or Net Working
Capital was prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles or whether
the agreed upon dollar amount of the Target Net Working Capital is correct or
appropriate or in accordance with the Accounting Principles or the definition
of Net Working Capital. In resolving each Disputed Item, the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be bound by the principles set forth in this _Section 2.8_
and may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest
value for such Disputed Item claimed by any party or less than the lowest
value for such Disputed Item claimed by any party. The parties further agree
that the adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.8_ is intended to show
the change between the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and the Final Net
Working Capital, the change between the Estimated Closing Acquired Servicing
Portfolio and the Final Closing Acquired Servicing Portfolio, and the change
between the Estimated Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee and the Final
Closing Weighted Average Servicing Fee, and that such changes can only be
measured if each calculation is done in a manner consistent with the
applicable definitions thereof. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will be allocated between the
Buyer and the Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the
Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully
disputed by the Seller (as finally determined by the Neutral Arbitrator) bears
to the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted. The Buyer and the
Seller and their respective agents will cooperate with the Neutral Arbitrator
during its engagement. The Neutral Arbitrator will deliver to the Buyer and
the Seller a written determination (such determination to include a work sheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Arbitrator by
the Seller and the Buyer, and a written explanation in reasonable detail of
each such determination) of the Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral
Arbitrator within thirty (30) calendar days, or such longer period as may be
required by the Neutral Arbitrator, of receipt of such Disputed Items, which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or
fraud. The final, binding and conclusive Closing Statement based either upon
agreement by the parties, or deemed agreement by the Buyer and the Seller in
accordance with this _Section 2.8_, or the written determination delivered by
the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this _Section 2.8(d)_ will be the "
_Conclusive Closing Statement_." All negotiations pursuant to this _Section
2.8(d)_ shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for
purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable other
laws including state rules of evidence, and all negotiations, submissions to
the Neutral Arbitrator, and dispute resolution proceedings under this _Section
2.8(d)_ shall be treated as such. The Neutral Arbitrator shall be bound by a
mutually agreeable confidentiality confidential information agreement. The

 



      
 

 



 

procedures of this _Section 2.8(d)_ are exclusive and, except as set forth
below, the determination of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be final and binding
on the parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this _Section 2.8(d)_ may
be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party
may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce
any decision under this _Section 2.8(d)_. The other partys only defense to
such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be
manifest error or fraud by or upon the Neutral Arbitrator. Absent such
manifest error or fraud, such other party shall reimburse the party seeking
enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 2.8(f)_:

 



 

(i) if the Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase Price,
then, in accordance with _Section 2.8(f)(iii)_, the Seller shall pay to the
Buyer an amount equal to the amount by which the Closing Purchase Price is
greater than the Final Purchase Price; such amount shall be paid (A) 50% in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (B) by surrender of
Buyer OP Units owned by Seller to the Buyer having a value (based on the
Reference Market Value of Parent Common Stock into which such Buyer OP Units
are convertible in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement)
equal to 50% of such amount; and

 



 

(ii) if the Closing Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price, the
Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount by which the
Closing Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price by wire transfer
of immediately available funds; such amount shall be paid (A) 50% in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds and (B) by issuance of Buyer OP
Units having a value (based on the Reference Market Value of Parent Common
Stock into which such Buyer OP Units are convertible in accordance with the
terms of the Partnership Agreement) equal to 50% of such amount (the amount
payable to the Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.8(e)(i)_ and the amount payable
to the Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)(i)_ are referred to herein as
the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount that is due to the
difference between Final Net Working Capital and Target Net Working Capital
shall be paid solely in cash.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 2.8_:

 



 

(A) the " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall be an amount in Dollars equal to (i)
the Base Purchase Price, _plus_ (ii) the Final Net Working Capital Excess
Amount, if any, _minus_ (iii) the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount,
if any, _plus or minus_ (iv) the adjustment for the Final Closing Acquired
Servicing Portfolio, _plus or minus_ (v) the adjustment for the Final Closing
Weighted Average Servicing Fee;

 



 

(B) the " _Final Net Working Capital_ " shall be the Net Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.8_;

 



 

(C) the " _Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount_ " shall be the amount, if
any, by which Net Working Capital as finally determined

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital;

 



 

(D) the " _Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount_ " shall be the amount,

Acquired Servicing Portfolio as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.8_;

shall be the Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.8_.

 



 

(f) If, after receipt of the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_:

 



 

(i) the Seller does not deliver a Seller Dispute Notice as described in
_Section 2.8(c)_ within the sixty (60) day period following the Sellers
receipt of the Closing Statement or if within such period the Seller delivers

day period or on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the
Buyer receives such Non-Dispute Notice, as applicable, the payments set forth

that is not subject to dispute; and

 



 

(iii) with respect to any Disputed Item, within five (5) Business Days after

(g) After the Closing and until the Final Purchase Price has been determined
in accordance with this _Section 2.8_, the Buyer shall provide to the Seller
and its Representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries and to any other information related to the
Included Business (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), including work
papers of their respective accountants (to the extent permitted by such

 



      
 

 



 

accountants), and to any of the Buyers or its Subsidiaries premises during
regular business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the extent
necessary for the Seller to review all or any part of the Closing Statement,
and to prepare materials for presentation to the Neutral Arbitrator in
connection with this _Section 2.8_.

the Purchased Assets (other than the Excess Servicing Strip and the Freddie
Mac I/O Strip); and

 



 

(ii) if the Final Closing Excess Servicing Strip and Freddie Mac I/O Strip is
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the Final Purchase Price (such excess, the

Section 2.9. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Seller and the Buyer agree that
the Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities, as determined for Tax
purposes) will be allocated among the Purchased Assets and any non-competition
and non-solicitation agreements entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for all Tax purposes in a manner
consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller for the Sellers review and
approval, a copy of the Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the "
_Asset Acquisition Statement_ ") allocating the Purchase Price (and any
assumed liabilities, as determined for Tax purposes) among the Purchased
Assets. The Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller, for the Sellers
review and approval, revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the "
_Revised Statements_ ") so as to reflect any matters on the Asset Acquisition
Statement that need updating (including any adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.8_). Within 30 days of delivery of the Asset
Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may be, the
Seller shall review such statements; and if the Seller agrees on the
allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted by _Section 2.8_ (and any
assumed liabilities, as determined for Tax purposes) (which shall be evidenced
by an Asset Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements signed by each of
the Buyer and the Seller), the Seller, the Buyer and their respective
Affiliates, shall file all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner
consistent with such agreed allocation and shall take no position inconsistent
therewith. In the event that the Seller and the Buyer are unable to agree on
such allocation within 30 days after the delivery of the Asset Acquisition
Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may

 



      
 

 



 

be, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement. In the event
that the parties cannot agree on the allocation as set forth in such Asset
Acquisition Statement or Revised Statements then none of the Buyer, the Seller
or any of their Affiliates shall be required pursuant hereto to file any Tax
Returns or information reports or otherwise take any positions consistent with
such allocation. In the event that the Buyer and the Seller are unable to
agree on the allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted by _Section 2.8_),
then each party will in any event file a Form 8594.

title to or a valid leasehold interest in all of the Purchased Assets, free
and clear of any Encumbrance, other than (i) liens for current taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable and for which adequate reserves have been

Encumbrances and other imperfections of title that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially impair the continued ownership, use and operation of
the assets to which they relate in the conduct of the Included Business as
currently conducted (collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_ "). The delivery
to the Buyer of the Bill of Sale and other instruments of assignment,
conveyance and transfer pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary

Assets and the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(b) Except for the Mortgage Servicing Rights and the Mortgage Loans Held for
Sale, there are no material differences between the fair value and the book

(c) The books of account and financial records of the Seller pertaining to the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Included Business are true

in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and consistent with past

reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed with managements

to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Included Business
(including the Carve-Out Financial Statements) and to maintain accountability
for the Sellers assets, and (iii) access to the Sellers assets is permitted

possession of the Seller or an Affiliate evidencing the underwriting and
origination of Mortgage Loans and files relating to each such Mortgage Loan).
The Seller has not received any advice or notification from its independent
accountants that the Seller has used any improper accounting practices that
would have the effect of not reflecting or incorrectly reflecting in the books
and records of the Seller, any properties, assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, equity accounts or other accounts.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.5(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedules,
each Seller does not have any material liabilities as of the date of this
Agreement that are related to the Included Business that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on or reserved on a balance sheet or reflected in a note
thereto except for each of the following: (i) performance obligations under

employees or agents on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Management Agreement to the extent not previously approved by the Special
Committee. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, except as
set forth on _Schedule 5.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, Parent shall not
do or propose to do, directly or indirectly, unless such action is
contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or in
the ordinary course of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, any of the
following without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed:

 



 

(i) acquire (by merger or stock or asset purchase or otherwise) any

or division thereof that, at the time such action is taken, to the knowledge
of Parent, would be likely to prevent the Closing;

 



 

(ii) amend the charter or bylaws of Parent, the partnership agreement of the

Schedules and other than dividends or distributions with a record date after

(iv) take any action, or intentionally fail to take any action, that would
cause any representation or warranty made by Parent or the Buyer in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be untrue or result in a breach of any
covenant made by the Buyer in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and in
each case such breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of
a condition in _Section 7.2(a)_ or has or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.2. _Covenants Regarding Information_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice,
except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or as would reasonably be
expected to breach the confidentiality provisions of any contract (it being
understood that the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not result in
such breach), the Seller shall afford the Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access to the properties, offices and other facilities, employees,
and books and records, and shall furnish the Buyer with such financial,
operating and other data and information to the extent relating primarily to
the Purchased Assets, the Included Business and Assumed Liabilities as the
Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted during normal business hours,
under the supervision of the Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not
unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of the Seller.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall provide the Buyer such information as the Buyer
reasonably requests in order for it to take advantage of its status as a

Business or the Assumed Liabilities.

incurred by the Buyer, the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records of
the Seller that do not constitute Business Records but may nevertheless relate

notice, afford the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access (including
for inspection and copying, at the Buyers expense), during normal business
hours, to such books and records and (iii) furnish the Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable assistance (at the Buyers expense), including
access to personnel, in connection with such claims and other proceedings;
_provided_ that such access shall be granted until the later of five years
following the Closing and the expiration date of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to Tax matters. The Seller shall not destroy any such
books and records without providing the Buyer with written notice detailing
the contents of such books and records, and

 



      
 

 



 

providing the Buyer with the opportunity to obtain such books and records at
least 60 days prior to the destruction thereof.

 



 

(e) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to

Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, they shall not, and shall take all action necessary to ensure that
none of their respective Affiliates or any of its respective Representatives
shall:

 



 

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Assets or the Included
Business, whether effected by sale of assets, sale of stock, merger or
otherwise; or

 



 

(b) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. The Seller and its respective Affiliates immediately
shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 



 

The Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly, but in any event within one
Business Day, orally and in writing if any such proposal or offer, or any
inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any
such notice to the Buyer shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of
the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms
and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. The Seller
shall not release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Seller is a party,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Ancillary Agreements_. The Seller, Buyer and Parent agree to
negotiate in good faith, prior to Closing, the terms of (i) the Freddie Mac
I/O Strip Assignment Agreement under which the Freddie Mac I/O Strip and the
Assumed Liabilities related thereto shall be transferred to the Partnership

Section 5.5. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date,
each party hereto shall give prompt written notice to the other party of (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any change, condition or event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would render any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
if made on or immediately following the date of such event, untrue or
inaccurate, (ii) the occurrence of any change, condition or event that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any failure of any party hereto or any of its
Affiliates to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be

 



      
 

 



 

complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or any event or condition that
would otherwise result in the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to the
other partys obligations hereunder, (iv) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or (v) any Action pending or, to the
partys knowledge, threatened against a party or the parties relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
that would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.8_ if it
had been pending on the date of this Agreement. If any event requires any
change to the Schedules to this Agreement, then the Seller shall promptly
deliver to the Buyer a supplement to the Schedules specifying such change. If
such updated Schedule reflects any event occurring or arising at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date on which each of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) is satisfied or waived in writing
by the appropriate party, as applicable, then the specified representations
and warranties made by the Seller will be deemed automatically modified to
reflect such event as of the date that such event occurs or arises and the
delivery of any such updated Schedules will be deemed to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such event. The Buyer will not have the right to
terminate this Agreement on account of any such update of the Schedules unless
the event giving rise to such updated disclosure would cause any of the
conditions in _Section 7.3(a)_ to not be satisfied assuming such event
existed as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Buyer hereby waives compliance by the
Seller with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction
in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer (other than
any obligations with respect to the application of the proceeds therefrom).

indemnify the Buyer against any and all liabilities that may be asserted by
third parties against the Buyer as a result of the Sellers noncompliance with
any such law.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Employee Matters_.

Seller Benefit Plans specifically identified on _Schedule 5.7(a)_ (all such
Seller Benefit Plans, the " _Assumed Benefit Plans_ "); provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer (or its Affiliate) may, in its
sole discretion, amend, suspend or terminate any such plan at any time in
accordance with its terms. The Buyer (or its Affiliate) and the Seller shall
take such actions and execute and deliver all documents and furnish all
notices with respect to the Assumed Benefit Plans as are necessary and
reasonably requested by the other parties to cause the Assumed Benefit Plans
to be assigned to and assumed by the Buyer (or its Affiliate) effective as of
the Closing. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, the Seller will
supply the Buyer (or its Affiliate) with (i) all records concerning
participation, vesting, accrual of benefits, payment of benefits, and election
forms of benefits under each Assumed Benefit Plan and (ii) any other
information reasonably requested by the Buyer (or its Affiliate) as necessary
or appropriate for the administration of each Assumed Benefit Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Buyer and the Seller agree to use the "alternate procedure" set forth
in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting for
the Transferred Employees on Forms W-2 for the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs. Seller will provide promptly (and in no event later than ten

at such employees expense. Seller will provide promptly (and in no event
later than ten (10) days) following the Closing such documents and other
information to Buyer as are necessary in order to enable Buyer to timely
satisfy its obligations under this subsection.

 



 

(d) This _Section 5.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.7_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.7_. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee
of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Transferred Employee any right
to continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification
of any Seller Benefit Plan, or create any right to compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Confidentiality_.

terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) For a period of three years following the Closing Date, the Seller shall

Representatives of the Seller and its Affiliates not to, use for its or their
own benefit or divulge or convey to any third party, any Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller or its Affiliates may
furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the Confidential Information
as the Seller or such Affiliate reasonably determines it is legally obligated
to disclose (based on the advice of legal counsel) if (i) it is required to
disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of a
subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a Governmental
Authority; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request, it notifies
the Buyer of the existence, terms and

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances surrounding such requirement and consults with the Buyer on the
advisability of taking steps available under applicable Law to resist or
narrow such request; and (iii) it exercises its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Confidential Information. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ " consists of all
information and data relating to the Purchased Assets, the Included Business
or Assumed Liabilities (including Intellectual Property, customer and supplier

provided in connection with any transaction involving the acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Assets. From and after the
Closing, the Seller will take all actions reasonably requested by the Buyer in
order to assist in enforcing the rights so assigned. The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Person to return to the
Seller any documents, files, data or other materials constituting Confidential
Information that was provided to such Person in connection with the
consideration of any such transaction. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Buyers sole cost, to
enforce the confidentiality covenants in any retained confidentiality
agreement that relates to the Purchased Assets or the Included Business, if
reasonably requested by the Buyer to do so in connection with an actual or
threatened breach of the confidentiality covenants by the other party to the
agreement that relates to the trade secrets or other confidential information
transferred to the Buyer.

make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement required
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law and (iii) have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling, judgment, injunction or
other action (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is then in
effect and that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal or otherwise
restricts or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither the Buyer, Parent nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement (A) to take or agree to undertake any action, including entering
into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that would
(i) require the divestiture of any assets of Parent, the Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates or any portion of the Purchased Assets or the Included
Business or (ii) limit Parents or the Buyers freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the Purchased Assets, the
Included Business or any of Parents, the Buyers or their respective
Affiliates other assets or businesses or (B) to take or refrain from taking,
or to agree to it, its Affiliates or the Included Business taking or
refraining from any action, or to suffer to exist any condition, limitation,
restriction or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate with any
other actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome
Condition. The Seller and the Buyer each will cooperate with the reasonable
request of the other in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals. The Seller and the Buyer each agree to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly
notify the other parties of any written communication it receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
written communication by such party to any Governmental Authority and shall
provide each other with copies of all written correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand. No
Party to this Agreement shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
_Section 5.8_, the Parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall each be
solely responsible for one half of the fees in connection with the filings and
submissions required under the HSR Act.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
agreement of Fannie Mae, FHA and Freddie Mac for the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Public Announcements_. The Parties hereto shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to

release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Seller
shall cooperate in preparing and cause to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") a proxy statement for a special meeting of
Parents stockholders (as amended or

 



      
 

 



 

supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall include in the Proxy
Statement a proposal or proposals for or relating to the approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
including the issuance of Parent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the

information (including financial statements and, subject to such auditors
approval, auditors consent) concerning itself, its Subsidiaries and the
respective equity holders to the other and provide such other assistance as
may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Parent and the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC (unless the SEC elects not to review the Proxy Statement) as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Parent and the Seller shall cause the Proxy
Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the federal securities Laws (including the SECs
proxy rules) and of Maryland law. Prior to filing the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto, Parent shall provide the Seller with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such proposed filing. Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the Seller
copies of any written comments and advise the Seller of any oral comments,
with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. Parent shall
provide the Seller with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC,
and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to
the Closing Date, any information should be discovered by either Party hereto
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by Parent with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated by Parent to the stockholders of
Parent.

 



 

(b) Parent shall mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with customary practice after the SECs review of the
Proxy Statement is completed.

Parent Stockholder Approval. Subject to the following sentence, the Board and
the Special Committee will recommend that Parent Stockholders vote in favor of
the issuance of Parent Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Buyer OP
Units and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements at the Stockholders Meeting, and Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at
any time prior to Parent Stockholder Approval, (i) the Special Committee may
withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the recommendation of the Special
Committee in a manner adverse to the

 



      
 

 



 

Seller if, but only if, the Special Committee determines in good faith, based
on such matters as it deems relevant and based on the advice of its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such
recommendation would be inconsistent with their duties as directors under
applicable law (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that the Seller
receives written notice from Parent confirming that the Special Committee has
determined to change its recommendation at least two Business Days in advance
of the recommendation being so withdrawn, withheld or modified in a manner
adverse to the Seller and (ii) the Board may withhold, amend, withdraw or
modify the recommendation of the Board in a manner adverse to the Seller if,
but only if, the Board determines in good faith, based on such matters as it
deems relevant and based on the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to withhold, amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation would be
inconsistent with their duties as directors under applicable law.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Approvals_. In addition to any approval of the Board or Parent
Stockholder Approval as may be required under applicable law, and without
limiting the other requirements set forth herein, the approval of the Special
Committee shall be required (a) for Parent or the Buyer to terminate this
Agreement or amend this Agreement, (b) for Parent or the Buyer to exercise or
waive any of Parents or the Buyers benefits, rights or remedies under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under _Article VIII_ after

in any material respect Parents or the Buyers obligations under this
Agreement and/or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (d) for Parent or the Buyer to settle,
compromise or take any action with respect to any claim for indemnification
brought by any Seller Indemnified Persons under _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Cooperation in Parent Offerings_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall provide, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their Representatives to provide, to Parent such cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement, syndication (including
marketing efforts in connection therewith and consummation of any financing
(including any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative
financing), or sale or distribution of any equity or debt securities (whether
registered or otherwise) made by Parent or any of its Affiliates (any such
transaction, a " _Parent Offering_ "), _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Seller; and _further provided_ that Parent shall be responsible for and shall
pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by
the Seller and its Affiliates (including fees and expenses of accountants,
attorneys and any other representatives) in connection with such Parent

to the Seller, as applicable. as promptly as reasonably practicable following
Parents request; (ii) participate,

and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a specific date or dates,
which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date
or dates);

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant made by or to be performed
by the Seller in this Agreement;

become liabilities of Parent or the Buyer by reason of successor liability, de
facto merger or

 



      
 

 



 

similar principles or operation of law that impose liability in the absence of
the assumption of such liability under this Agreement or the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by Parent and the Buyer_. After the Closing, and subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_, Parent and the Buyer

Liability.

 



 

Section 8.3. _Indemnifiable Damage Deductible; Other Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
indemnification shall be available under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than any
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of the failure of any Seller Fundamental
Representation or the representations and warranties in _Section 3.14_ to be
true and correct or other than in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) unless and until all Indemnifiable Damages suffered by the
Buyer Indemnified Persons, as the case may be, exceed in the aggregate
$1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and then the Indemnifiable Damages under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_, as the case may be, shall be limited to those that

(other than _Sections 2.5_ and _5.15_ or other than fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) the Sellers maximum liability shall not exceed
$30,000,000. Subject to the foregoing, in connection with any Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of _Section 8.2_, other than fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, the maximum liability of the Seller, on the one hand, or
Parent and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) Indemnifiable Damages that may be recovered pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall take account of and be reduced by (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to any indemnification by or
indemnification agreement with any third party (net of the cost of recovery of
such amounts, including any increase in premium) and (ii) the amount of any
insurance proceeds, contribution payments or reimbursements actually received
by the Indemnified Person in respect thereof (net of the cost of recovery of
such amounts) (each Person named and source identified in clauses (i) and
(ii), a " _Collateral Source_ "). If the amount from Collateral Sources to be
netted hereunder from any payment required under _Section 8.2_ is received by
an Indemnified Person after payment by the Seller, or Parent or the

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer, as the case may be, of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Person under this _Article VIII_, the Indemnified Persons shall
repay to the Seller or Parent, as the case may be,, promptly after such
receipt, any amount that the Seller or Parent or the Buyer, as the case may
be, would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_ had such
receipt been made at the time of such payment (net of the cost of recovery of
such amounts from Collateral Sources).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any
Indemnified Person becoming aware of any claim as to which indemnification may
be sought by such Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article VIII_, such
Indemnified Person shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts, consistent
with normal practices and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate
such Indemnifiable Damages; provided that any failure to comply with this
_Section 8.3(c)_ shall not limit the Indemnifiable Damages recoverable by
such Indemnified Person from the Seller hereunder.

 



 

(d) Neither Seller, Parent nor the Buyer, shall be liable for any
Indemnifiable Damages in respect of any liability or Indemnifiable Damage
which is contingent unless and until such contingent liability or
Indemnifiable Damage becomes an actual liability or loss and is due and
payable. Neither Seller, Parent nor the Buyer shall be liable to pay any
amount in discharge of a claim under this _Article VIII_ unless and until the
liability or Indemnifiable Damage in respect of which the claim is made has
become due and payable.

 



 

(e) The Seller, Parent and the Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the consideration payable to
the Seller under this Agreement for all income Tax purposes.

 



 

Section 8.4. _Notice of Claims_.

 



 

(a) In order to seek indemnification under _Section 8.2_, the Indemnified
Person shall deliver to the Seller or Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be,
written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") promptly after the Indemnified
Person has knowledge of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VIII_; _provided_ that any delay in providing such notice shall not result in
the Indemnified Person losing its rights under this _Article VIII_ except to
the extent that the Seller or Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, is
materially prejudiced thereby:

 



 

(i) stating that the Indemnified Person has a claim for Indemnifiable Damages;

 



 

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages that have been incurred,
paid, reserved or accrued, in each case to the extent then known to the
Indemnified Person (the " _Claimed Amount_ "); and

upon the information then possessed by, the Indemnified Person) the individual
items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the
nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related and the
provision of the Agreement which gives rise to the claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, shall give the other Party reasonable access to the books, records and
assets of such Party which evidence or support such claim or the act, omission
or occurrence giving rise to such claim and the right, upon reasonable prior
notice during normal business hours, to interview any appropriate personnel of
such Party related thereto.

respect to a third party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Seller, on the
one hand, or Parent and the Buyer, on the other hand, may appoint counsel of
such persons choice at the expense of such person to represent the
Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnified Person may reasonably
designate in connection with such Third Party Claim (in which case the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by any Indemnified Person shall
not be Indemnifiable Damages); _provided_ , that (i) such Third Party Claim
seeks monetary damages only and does not seek injunctive or other equitable
relief, (ii) there are no allegations of criminal wrongdoing alleged or
asserted in such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the applicable indemnifying
Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Indemnified Person from and against Indemnifiable Damages arising
out of or relating to such Third Party Claim on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this _Article VIII_. Neither Seller, Parent nor the
Buyer, as the case may be, shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnified Person,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate at its own expense in
the defense of such asserted liability, but shall not be entitled to settle or
compromise such asserted liability without the prior written consent of the
Seller, or Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) If the Seller, Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, elects to defend
any Third Party Claim, the Seller, Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be,
shall (i) promptly submit to the Indemnified Person copies of all pleadings,
responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers
received or filed in connection therewith, (ii) permit the Indemnified Person
and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense and any settlement
thereof and (iii) permit the Indemnified Person and its counsel an opportunity
to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their submission. The
Parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim,
including by providing access to each others relevant business records and
other documents and employees.

warranty by for purposes of this _Article VIII_ (other than for determining
whether there has been a failure or breach of _Section 3.6(b)_), or in

failure or breach, such representations and warranties shall be read without

shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taking any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the party so

 



       
 

 



 

requesting termination shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
have such order, decree, rule or other action vacated;

 



 

(f) by Parent or the Buyer, in the event of a Change in Recommendation;

 



 

(g) by Parent or the Buyer, if between the date hereof and the Closing, an
event or condition occurs that has had or is reasonably likely to have a

issuance of any Parent Common Stock or the Buyer OP Units would be deemed too
dilutive to Parent or the capital markets are unreceptive to any Parent
Offering, in each case as determined by the Special Committee in its sole and
absolute discretion, _provided_ that, at the same time as Parent or the Buyer
sends a notice of termination pursuant to this _Section 9.1(h)_, Parent or
the Buyer pays to the Seller the Termination Fee described in _Section 9.2_
below.

 



 

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1_

Agreement such termination is under.

 



 

Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination; Termination Fee_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of
either party except (a) for the provisions of _Sections 3.20_ and _4.5_

_Section 10.7_ relating to third-party beneficiaries, _Section 10.8_
relating to governing law, _Section 10.9_ relating to submission to

either party from liability for any intentional breach of this Agreement or
any agreement made as of the date hereof or subsequent thereto pursuant to
this Agreement and (c) for the provisions of the next sentence of this
_Section 9.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of: (i)

the Buyer the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Sellers or the Buyers respective right to receive
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller, Parent or the Buyer, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Affiliates against Parent, the Buyer or the
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members or representatives for any and all losses that
may be suffered based upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances
giving rise to such termination, and upon payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with this _Section 9.2_, none of Parent, the Buyer or the Seller,
as applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective stockholders, partners, members or representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation

 



      
 

 



 

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

Section 9.3. _Election to Extend End Date_. If at least one of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ (as a result of an Order or Law under the HSR
Act), _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ (as a result of any Action
relating to the HSR Act or any other Law relating to antitrust or regulation
of competition) shall not have been satisfied, then, at the written election
of Parent or the Buyer, the End Date may be extended by a period of three
months (and in the case of such extension, any reference to the End Date in
any other provision of this Agreement shall be a reference to the End Date, as
extended pursuant to this _Section 9.3_); provided, that the End Date shall
under no circumstance be extended beyond November 15, 2016. In the event
Parent or the Buyer elects to extend the End Date, Parent or the Buyer shall
give written notice of such election to the Seller in accordance with _Section
10.4_. In the absence of an election, Parent and the Buyer shall be deemed to
have elected to not extend the End Date.

transfers, assigns, and delivers to ARSR all of Sellers interest, rights and
title as of the Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets (except as set

the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns, but may not be assigned by any party without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. None of the provisions of this
Bill of Sale and Instrument of Assignment may be waived, changed or altered
except in writing by all of the parties hereto.

 



 

Nothing in this Bill of Sale and Instrument of Assignment, express or implied,

SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 



 

SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of , 2016, is by and between
Arbor Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Parent"), and Arbor
Commercial Mortgage, LLC, a New York limited liability company ("ACM").
Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings

WITNESSETH

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Arbor Realty Limited Partnership, ARSR Acquisition Company,
LLC, ACM and Arbor Commercial Funding, LLC have entered into that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement, dated February 25, 2016 (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"), pursuant to which the Seller, in addition to other transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, has agreed to sell the Included
Business to the Buyer; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as part of the sale of the Included Business, certain of ACMs
employees will become Transferred Employees and thereby become employees of
Parent and/or one or more of Parents subsidiaries (all such Transferred
Employees and all other present or future employees of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, the "Parent Employees"); and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent and ACM agree and acknowledge that following the Closing, ACM,
and Ivan Kaufman ("Kaufman") and affiliates of ACM and Kaufman (ACM, Kaufman
and such affiliates, the "Affiliated Entities") will continue to operate the
Excluded Business and, subject to the provisions of the Non-Compete Agreement,
the Affiliated Entities may invest in and/or operate other businesses (the
Excluded Business and all such other businesses, the "Affiliated Businesses");
and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto acknowledge that certain Parent Employees will
from time to time provide services to the Affiliated Businesses and by
entering into this Agreement the parties hereto intend to (i) acknowledge and
agree to such Parent Employees providing such services to the Affiliated
Businesses in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
this Agreement and (ii) agree to and provide the means for ACM to reimburse
Parent for the allocable cost of such Parent Employees proving such services.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and understandings contained
herein and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Transferred Employees_.

 



 

(a) Schedule 1 annexed to this Agreement lists (i) those Transferred Employees
who, as of the date of this Agreement, are reasonably expected to provide
services to the Affiliated Businesses following the Closing, (ii) a
description of the services reasonably expected to be provided by the
Transferred Employees to the Affiliated Businesses (the "Permitted Services")
and (iii) the estimate of that portion of the cost of each Transferred
Employee reasonably allocated to the Permitted Services (the "Parent Employee
Cost(s)").

      
 

 



 

(b) From time to time, but not less frequently than quarterly, ACM shall
update the information on Schedule 1 to reflect changes, if any, in the Parent
Employees providing Permitted Services (the "Covered Parent Employee(s)") and
changes, if any, to the cost of any Covered Parent Employee reasonably
allocated to the Permitted Services. Such updates shall be provided to the
Audit Committee of Parents Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") and
shall be subject to the approval of the Audit Committee, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

2. _Reimbursement of Parent Employee Costs_.

 



 

(a) _Cost Reimbursement_.

 



 

(i) _General_. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2(a), ACM shall
reimburse Parent for the Parent Employee Costs relating to the Permitted
Services (other than (x) annual bonus payments to Covered Parent Employees,
which shall be reimbursed pursuant to Section 2(a)(iii) hereof and (y) any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Affiliated Businesses which
shall be reimbursed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof) pursuant to the following
procedures and guidelines.

 



 

(A) With respect to the Closing, on or prior to a day which is at least
days prior to the Closing, and thereafter, on or prior to December 31st of
each year (beginning on December 31, 2016), ACM shall submit to the Audit
Committee an estimate of the Parent Employee Costs for the next succeeding
year (the "Proposed Parent Employee Costs"). The Proposed Parent Employee
Costs will include a reasonably detailed description of the Permitted Services
expected to be provided by Parent Employees during such year and the Parent
Employee Costs associated therewith. Such Proposed Parent Employee Costs may
include pro rata allocations of Parents costs for (1) the property and
services of Parent expected to be utilized by the Affiliated Businesses and
(2) the base salaries and annual bonus potential, if any, of each Covered
Parent Employee.

 



 

(B) On or prior to the Closing, and thereafter, on or prior to February 28th
of each year (beginning on February 28, 2017), Parent and ACM each agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the amount and type of the
Parent Employee Costs expected to be incurred by Parent for the year in
question that will be reimbursed by ACM (the "Agreed-Upon Budget").

 



 

(C) Within forty-five (45) days after the last day of each calendar quarter
beginning with the first quarter ending after the Closing Date, Parent shall
submit a report to ACM (with a copy to the Audit Committee) setting forth (1)
Parents actual Parent Employee Costs for such quarter, and (2) the amounts
set forth in the Agreed-Upon Budget allocable to such quarter. In addition,
Parent shall cause each supervisor of a Covered Parent Employee to certify to
Parent and the Audit Committee whether or not there have been any material
changes in the amount of time dedicated to Permitted Services in such quarter
(a "Supervisor Certification").

 



      
 

 



 

(1) If the Parent Employee Costs in any given quarter exceeds the amount set
forth in the Agreed-Upon Budget allocable to such quarter, excluding any
annual bonus potential amounts for any Covered Parent Employee (the "Excess
Quarterly Costs"), ACM shall reimburse Parent for such Excess Quarterly Costs
upon receipt of a written request to ACM describing the type and amount of
such Excess Quarterly Costs.

 



 

(2) If the Parent Employee Costs in any given quarter is less than the amount
set forth in the Agreed-Upon Budget allocable to such quarter, excluding any
annual bonus potential amounts for any Covered Parent Employee, Parent shall
refund to ACM the difference between the actual Parent Employee Costs in such
quarter and the amount set forth in the Agreed-Upon Budget allocable to such
quarter.

 



 

(ii) _Parent Employee Cost Reimbursement Installments_. Subject to clause
(i)(C) of this Section 2(a), ACM shall pay Parent one-twelfth (1/12) of the
Agreed-Upon Budget (other than any amounts identified as the "annual bonus
potential" of any Covered Parent Employee) in cash on a monthly basis in
arrears (each, a "Parent Employee Cost Reimbursement Installment") within
twenty (20) days of the last day of the calendar month with respect to which
such Parent Employee Cost Reimbursement Installment is payable. If ACM is
required to reimburse Parent for any Excess Quarterly Costs pursuant to
Section 2(a)(i)(C), ACM shall include one-third (1/3rd) of such Excess
Quarterly Costs for any subsequent periods in the monthly Parent Employee Cost
Reimbursement Installments payable to Parent immediately following such
determination.

 



 

(iii) _Covered Parent Employee Bonuses_. ACM shall reimburse Parent for a
portion of the annual bonus amounts proposed to be paid to each Covered Parent
Employee by Parent. Within ten (10) business days after Parent provides
written notice to ACM of the aggregate bonuses paid to the Covered Parent
Employees, ACM shall pay to Parent that amount which represents the Parent
Employee Cost associated with such bonuses, provided however, that in
calculating the Parent Employee Cost associated with such bonuses, for any
Covered Parent Employee whose time is allocated 50% or less to the Permitted
Services, the bonus to be considered in such calculation shall be the lower of
(x) such Covered Parent Employees annual bonus potential or (y) the actual
bonus paid to such Covered Parent Employee.

 



 

(b) _Expenses_. Quarterly, Parent shall submit to ACM, in writing, all out-of-
pocket third party expenses that it may have paid on behalf of the Affiliated
Entities and ACM shall reimburse parent for such expenses with ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of such written list of expenses. Such expenses may
include, but are not limited to, the following:

 



 

(i) travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Covered Parent
Employees in connection with activities of the Affiliated Businesses;

 



 

(ii) the cost of any insurance arranged for, or maintained by Parent, for the
benefit of the Affiliated Businesses, including, without limitation, insurance
related to employee benefits; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) other costs and expenses relating to the business and operations, of the
Affiliated Businesses, including, without limitation, the costs and expenses
of acquiring, owning, protecting, maintaining, developing and disposing of
investments, including taxes, license fees and appraisal, reporting, audit and
legal fees.

 



 

3. _Term_. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from the date hereof until the date the fully diluted beneficial ownership of the common stock of Parent collectively held by ACM and Kaufman and their respective Affiliates (including for the avoidance of doubt any OP Units of the Operating Partnership held by ACM and Kaufman and their respective Affiliates) falls below 10%.

 



 

4. _Indemnification_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, (i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless ACM and its officers, directors and employees (the "ACM Indemnified Parties) from and against any losses, costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred by the ACM Indemnified Parties to extent caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Parent and (ii) ACM shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its officers, directors and employees (the "Parent Indemnified Parties) from and against any losses, costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties to extent caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of ACM.

 



 

5. _Amendment and Modification_.

and (z), other than any Transferred Employees) to terminate, alter or cease
his, her or its relationship with the Excluded Business, ACM or its
Subsidiaries or such Kaufman Business; provided, that the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing shall not prohibit (A) a general solicitation to the public of
general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by search firms not

their respective Subsidiaries and to supervise, review or terminate any
employees of each of the Company, ACM, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Subject to compliance with the terms of Section 2(a) herein, the
parties agree that the Kaufman Businesses and the Seller Target Investments
are outside the scope of the Companys sphere of business and therefore shall
not be deemed to be a corporate opportunity of the Company.

Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

5. _Amendment and Modification_.

6. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, (b) on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered utilizing a next-day service by a recognized next-day courier or (c) on the earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

 **MASTER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS MASTER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT (" **Agreement** ") is made effective as
of the close of business on , 2016 (" **Agreement Date** "), by and between
[SERVICER], a New York limited liability company, as assignor (" **ACF,** "
and together with its successors or assigns, the " **Servicer** ") and Arbor
Realty Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, as assignee (the
"OP," and together with its successors and assigns, the "
**Certificateholder** "). The Servicer and the Certificateholder are
collectively referred to as the " **Parties**." Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning given to such terms
in Schedule I herein.

 



 

 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

A. On or after the Agreement Date, the Servicer shall own certain mortgage
servicing rights (" **Servicing Rights** ") related to multifamily residential
mortgage loans (the " **Mortgage Loans** ") originated or acquired by the
Servicer from time to time and delivered to the Federal National Mortgage
Association (" **Fannie Mae** " or the **"Agency"** ). The Servicer will
service such Mortgage Loans in accordance with Applicable Requirements
pursuant to the Agency Agreement including but not limited to capital
requirements, if any. The Servicing Rights are subject to the subordination of
interest agreement to be entered into among the Servicer, the
Certificateholder and Fannie Mae (the " **Subordination of Interest
Agreement** ") relating to the Agency Agreement and the acknowledgment to be
entered into among the Servicer, the Certificateholder and Bank of America,
N.A. (the " **BoA Acknowledgment Agreement** ") relating to the Credit
Agreement.

 



 

B. The Certificateholder desires to acquire Participation Interests in Excess
Servicing Fees (each as hereinafter defined), and the Servicer desires to
transfer such Participation Interests in Excess Servicing Fees to the
Certificateholder.

 



 

C. The Servicer may engage a subservicer to subservice Mortgage Loans (each
subservicer so engaged to subservice Mortgage Loans is referred to herein as a
" **Subservicer** ") as to which the Servicer will own the related Servicing
Rights, pursuant to certain subservicing agreements (each as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, a " **Subservicing
Agreement** "), between the Servicer and the applicable Subservicer, pursuant
to which such Subservicer will be entitled to retain certain amounts set forth
in the applicable Subservicing Agreement (the " **Subservicing Fee** ") from
collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loans.

 



 

D. The Servicer will be entitled to receive a gross servicing fee (" **Gross
Servicing Fee** ") with respect to each Servicing Right, at the per annum
amount listed on Schedule I attached to each Purchase Offer (as defined
below), payable to the Servicer monthly for servicing of the related Mortgage
Loans and payable from collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loans as
provided in the Agency Agreement.

      
 

 



 

E. Under this Agreement, the Servicer will be entitled to retain the specified
basis point servicing fee with respect to each Investment Pool (as defined
below) set out on the attached Schedule II (the " **Retained Servicing Fee**
"), and all ancillary income and reimbursements received for advances and
other out of pocket expenses from the Agency in accordance with the Agency
Agreement.

 



 

F. As of the date hereof, or the Purchase Date for subsequently created or
acquired Servicing Rights, the Servicer is willing to perform the functions
required under the Agency Agreement (including by engaging a Subservicer) in
exchange for the related Retained Servicing Fee.

 



 

G. Based on its knowledge and experience, the Servicer believes that the
Retained Servicing Fee will represent not less than reasonable compensation
for performing all of its obligations (including any loss share obligations
and any obligations under a Subservicing Agreement) under the Agency
Agreement. The Servicer is not eligible to elect, and has not elected, to use
the safe harbor set forth in Revenue Procedure 91-50 for determining what
amounts represent reasonable compensation for servicing the Mortgage Loans.

 



 

H. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the " **Excess Servicing Fee** " is the
difference between the Gross Servicing Fee and the related Retained Servicing
Fee as of such date. The Servicer will be entitled to retain the Retained
Servicing Fee and all ancillary fees with respect to the Agency Agreement, but
will not be entitled to retain any Excess Servicing Fees as to which a
Participation Interest has been assigned to the Certificateholder pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

I. Based on the foregoing, and upon the execution of the Subordination of
Interest Agreement and the BoA Acknowledgment Agreement, the Servicer wishes
to transfer to the Certificateholder a Participation Interest in the Excess
Servicing Fees that are derived from Servicing Rights listed on Schedule I to
the Purchase Offer dated the date hereof. The Servicer and the
Certificateholder may in the future mutually agree to transfer additional
Participation Interests pursuant to a future Purchase Offer. As owner of such
Participation Interest, the Certificateholder would be entitled to a portion
of the Gross Servicing Fees to which the Servicer will be entitled in
connection with the related Investment Pools equal to part or all of the
Excess Servicing Fees (collectively, the " **Excess Servicing Fee
Receivables** "). It is the intention of the Parties to treat this
Participation Interest for federal income tax purposes as a series of
"stripped coupons" within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 1286.
This participation does not transfer any of the servicing obligations to the
Certificateholder, but merely transfers to the Certificateholder beneficial
ownership of part or all of the Excess Servicing Fees in accordance with the
terms hereof. The Certificateholder has no right to control the manner in
which the Servicer performs the Servicers servicing obligations under the
Agency Agreement. Pursuant to this participation, the Certificateholder will
be entitled only to the Excess Servicing Fees and not to the Retained
Servicing Fee or any

 



      
 

 



 

portion thereof that represents reasonable compensation for fulfilling the
obligations of the Servicer under the Agency Agreement.

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the
Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

1. **_Participation Interests_**.

 



 

(a) Upon the execution of the Subordination of Interest Agreement and the BoA
Acknowledgment Agreement, the Servicer hereby agrees from time to time to
create one or more participation interests evidencing an exclusive right of
the Certificateholder to participate in the ownership of certain Excess
Servicing Fee Receivables (each a " **Participation Interest** ") relating to
a group of Servicing Rights described in _Schedule I_ to the related Purchase
Offer (defined below) (each an " **Investment Pool** "). Each Participation
Interest shall be evidenced by a recording on the books and records of the
Servicer naming the Certificateholder as an owner in the right to receive such
Excess Servicing Fee Receivables. The Servicer shall appoint a registrar,
initially the Servicer (the " **Registrar** ") which shall maintain, or cause
to be maintained, a register of the Participation Interests issued and
outstanding (the " **Interest Register** ") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Registrar shall provide for
the registration of Participation Interests and of transfers and exchanges as
provided in this Agreement. With respect to each Participation Interest, in
addition to the information described in _Section 1(c)_, the Interest
Register shall clearly identify the Certificateholder (or any applicable
successor or permitted assign) as the owner of the Participation Interest (the
" **Owner** "), the related Investment Pool and the Excess Servicing Fees, the
portion of the related Excess Servicing Fees that are considered Excess
Servicing Fee Receivables and that are being assigned pursuant to such
Participation Interest and any other Participation Interest related to the
same Investment Pool, and the Owners percentage of undivided interest in such
Excess Servicing Fee Receivables.

 



 

(b) (i) The Parties may in the future agree (with a frequency not to exceed
monthly) to the sale and purchase of a Participation Interest related to
Servicing Rights created or to be acquired at a purchase price (with respect
to each Participation Interest, the " **Purchase Price** "), mutually agreed
by the Parties. At least two (2) Business Days (which is any day except a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday on which the commercial banks in New York City,
New York are permitted or authorized by law or executive order to be closed, a
" **Business Day** ") prior to the proposed purchase date (a " **Purchase
Date** "), the Servicer shall deliver to the Certificateholder, a Purchase
Offer in substantially the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "
**Purchase Offer** ").

 



 

(ii) The Certificateholder shall accept or reject the Purchase Offer within [
] Business Days. The Certificateholder shall not accept any Purchase Offer
unless

 



      
 

 



 

(1) the Agency has entered into the Subordination of Interest Agreement with
respect to the Servicing Rights relating to the Participation Interest subject
to the Purchase Offer, (2) Bank of America, N.A. has entered into the BoA
Acknowledgment Agreement with respect to the Servicing Rights relating to the
Participation Interest subject to the Purchase Offer, (3) no Event of Default
(as defined herein) shall have occurred, and (4) no event shall have occurred
which event if left uncured beyond any applicable cure period described in
Section 5(a) below would constitute an Event of Default. It is not the
intention of the Parties to transfer any of the Servicers right, title,
interest or obligations in, to and under the Agency Agreement, but merely for
the Servicer to transfer to the Certificateholder the Participation Interest
in the related Excess Servicing Fee Receivables in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 



 

(iii) The Servicer shall remit to the Certificateholder by the [ ] Business
Day of each month (the " **Distribution Date** ") the amount due with respect
to each Participation Interest and the related Investment Pool in accordance
with the following: The Gross Servicing Fees collected in each month with
respect to an Investment Pool shall be allocated as follows, in each case with
respect to the Mortgage Loans included in the related Investment Pool:

 



 

(1) First, to pay any accrued and unpaid Subservicing Fees and any other costs
of servicing;

 



 

(2) Second, to pay any accrued and unpaid Retained Servicing Fees to the
Servicer to the extent it exceeds the amounts payable pursuant to clause (1),
it being understood that the amounts in clause (1) are treated as paid out of
the Retained Servicing Fees; and

 



 

(3) Third, all remaining amounts, if any, to pay to the Owner of the
Participation Interest as Excess Servicing Fee Receivables.

 



 

Except as provided herein, under no circumstances shall the Servicer be
required to remit to the Certificateholder in any month an amount with respect
to a Participation Interest that is greater than the amount specified in
clause (3) above for the related Investment Pool for such month. In the event
the amount specified in clause (1) above exceeds the Gross Servicing Fees
collected for any month, any shortfall amount shall be paid by the Servicer.
In addition, in the event the amount specified in clause (1) exceeds the
Retained Servicing Fee for any month (such excess is referred to as the "
**Subservicing Excess** "), the Servicer shall be responsible for paying an
additional amount to the Owner of the Participation Interest (beyond the
amount distributed from the Gross Servicing Fees collected in such month
pursuant to clause (3) above) equal to the Subservicing Excess out of its own
funds, but only after all amounts described in clause (1) above have been
paid. In addition, in the event that Gross Servicing Fees retained pursuant to
the Credit Agreement exceed the Retained Servicing Fee for any month (such
excess is referred to as the " **Letter of Credit Holdback** "), the Servicer
shall be responsible for paying an additional amount to the Owner of the
Participation

 



      
 

 



 

Interest (beyond the amount distributed from the Gross Servicing Fees
collected in such month pursuant to clause (3) above) equal to the Letter of
Credit Holdback out of its own funds.

 



 

(c) Upon transfer of any Participation Interest, the Registrar shall note in
the Interest Register the ownership percentage transferred, the original
purchase price of the Participation Interest, the date of transfer and the
name and address of the transferee or transferees or, in the case of an
exchange, the name and address of the Owner all within the meaning of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 5(f).103-1(c); _provided_ , as a condition to any
registration of transfer, each transferee shall be deemed to have made all the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in _Section 3_ of this
Agreement. Each Participation Interest shall be registered and may be
transferred to any third person only by notice from the Owner to the Registrar
and the recordation by the Registrar of a new Participation Interest assigned
to the transferee, as required under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.871-14(c). The Servicer and the Registrar shall treat the Owner whose name
is recorded in the Interest Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the
beneficial owner of such Participation Interest for all purposes under this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or

in connection with any such transfer or exchange.

 



 

(e) The Registrar shall not be responsible for determining compliance with the
restrictions on transfer in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The Owner effecting transfer thereof shall indemnify the Registrar, in its
individual and fiduciary capacities, and the other Owners against any
liability that may result if the transfer is not exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Each Owner shall be deemed by its
acceptance and holding of its Participation Interest to agree that none of the
Registrar or any Owner is under an obligation to register the Participation
Interests under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " **Securities
Act** ") or any other securities law.

 



 

(g) The Participation Interests may not be offered, transferred or sold except
to Accredited Investors within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act (an " **Accredited Investor** ") in reliance of an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

 



 

(h) The Participation Interests have not been registered or qualified under
the Securities Act, or any state securities law. No transfer, sale, pledge or
other disposition of any Participation Interest shall be made unless such
disposition is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and effective registration or qualification under applicable
state securities laws, or is made in a transaction which does not require such
registration or qualification. In

 



      
 

 



 

addition, no transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Participation
Interest shall be made without prior written consent of the Servicer in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(i) No offer, sale, transfer or other disposition (including pledge) of a
Participation Interest shall be made to any Person (which means and include
natural persons, corporations, limited partnerships, general partnerships,
limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, joint stock
companies, joint ventures, associations, companies, trusts, banks, trust
companies, land trusts, business trusts or other organizations, whether or not
legal entities, and government authorities, a " **Person** ") which is, or is
purchasing for, or on behalf of (A) an employee benefit plan, retirement
arrangement, individual retirement account or Keogh plan subject to either
Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (B) an
entity (including an insurance company general account) whose underlying
assets include plan assets by reason of any such plans arrangements or
accounts investment in any such entity.

 



 

(j) Unless and until otherwise directed in writing by the Owner registered in
the Interest Register, any payments or distributions on the related
Participation Interest shall be made via wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated in writing by the
Certificateholder.

 



 

(k) The Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to one or more Owners
within three (3) calendar days after receipt by the Registrar of a written
request therefor, a list of the names and addresses of the Owners as of the
most recent Record Date for payments to Owners. If one or more Owners
(hereinafter referred to as " **Applicants** "), apply in writing to the
Registrar, and such application states that the Applicants desire to
communicate with other Owners with respect to their rights under this
Agreement or under the Participation Interests, then the Registrar shall,
within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford
such Applicants access, during normal business hours, to the current list of
Owners.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge that the Participation Interests (1) will not be issued unless the
Subordination of Interest Agreement has been executed with respect to the
Servicing Rights related to the Participation Interests to be issued; (2) will
be acquired from the Servicer in a transaction or chain of transactions not
involving any public offering; (3) are uncertificated and ownership thereof is
recorded only on the books of the Servicer, as Registrar, in the name of the
Certificateholder; and (4) are not transferable without the prior consent of
the Servicer.

 



      
 

 



 

2. **_Security Interest and Pledge of Servicing Rights_**.

 



 

(a) The Servicer shall take all necessary actions to complete or perfect the
transfer of Participation Interests to the Certificateholder, including filing
statements to "perfect" the conveyed interest under the Uniform Commercial
Code (" **UCC** ").

 



 

(b) It is the express intent of the Servicer and the Certificateholder that
the transfers of the Excess Servicing Fee Receivables represented by a
Participation Interest and related rights by the Servicer to the
Certificateholder, as contemplated by this Agreement be, and be treated as,
true sales of such Excess Servicing Fee Receivables for all purposes and not
as loans secured thereby. If, notwithstanding the intent of the Parties or any
other provision hereof, the transfer of such Excess Servicing Fee Receivables
represented by a Participation Interest is construed to constitute property of
the Servicer or such conveyance is not treated as a sale to the
Certificateholder for all purposes, then (i) this Agreement also is intended
by the Parties to be, and hereby is, a security agreement within the meaning
of the UCC; and (ii) the conveyance by the Servicer provided for in this
Agreement shall be treated as the grant of, and the Servicer hereby grants to
the Certificateholder, a first priority security interest (subject to the
claims, off-sets, preferences, rights, prerogatives and interests of the
Agency arising as a matter of law, pursuant to the Subordination of Interest
Agreement or the Agency Agreement, or of the Letter of Credit Provider arising
as a matter of law pursuant to the BoA Acknowledgment Agreement or the Credit
Agreement (such liens being referred to herein as " **Permitted Liens** "))
in, to and under all of the Servicers right, title and interest in, to and
under the Excess Servicing Fee Receivables represented by such Participation
Interest, and proceeds relating thereto, to secure the payment and performance
of the Servicers obligations to the Certificateholder under this Agreement
and any other Basic Document (as defined herein), or as may be determined in
connection therewith by applicable law. The Servicer shall, to the extent
consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to
ensure that, if such agreement were deemed to create a security interest in,
and not to constitute a sale of, Excess Servicing Fee Receivables, such
security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest in favor
of the Certificateholder under applicable law and shall be maintained as such
throughout the term of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Upon the execution of the Subordination of Interest Agreement and the BoA
Acknowledgment Agreement, the Servicer shall grant to the Certificateholder,
for the benefit of the Owners, a security interest in the following, in each
case, as to each type of property described below, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired by the Servicer, wherever located, and whether now or
hereafter existing or arising (collectively, the " **Collateral** "):

to become due thereunder or pursuant thereto, (B) all rights of the Servicer
to receive proceeds of any insurance, indemnity, warranty or guaranty with
respect thereto, (C) all claims of the Servicer for damages arising therefrom
or for breach of or default thereunder and (D) the right of the Servicer to
terminate such agreements, to perform thereunder and to compel performance and
otherwise exercise all remedies thereunder) whether now existing or hereafter
arising, accruing or acquired;

 



 

(iv) all of the Servicers right, title and interest in and to the profits,

compensation are yet accrued, earned, due or payable, and all of the
Servicers proceeds and rights to proceeds of any sale or other disposition of
any or all of the Pledged Servicing Receivables;

 



 

(vi) all of the Servicers files, surveys, certificates, correspondence,
appraisals, tapes, discs, cards, accounting records and other information and
data directly relating to any of the Pledged Servicing Receivables;

security for or claims against others in respect of the Pledged Servicing

Agreement and any other agreements with any Subservicer relating to the

security interest that may be granted hereunder, are subject and subordinate
in each and every respect to: (i) all rights, powers, and prerogatives of

defaults and outstanding obligations of the Servicer to Fannie Mae. Such

Rights from which the Collateral arises that such Servicing Rights have been
assigned to the Certificateholder and that all payments thereon are to be made
directly to the the Certificateholder or such other Person as may be
designated by the Certificateholder; (ii) settle, compromise, or release, in
whole or in part, any amounts owing on the Servicing Rights from which the
Collateral arises or any portion of the Servicing Rights from which the
Collateral arises, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Certificateholder and
(iii) take reasonable steps to enforce payment and performance and to
prosecute any reasonable action or proceeding with respect to any and all
Servicing Rights from which the Collateral arises and where any such Servicing
Rights are in default, take reasonable steps to collect, foreclose on and
enforce liens or security interests securing, such Servicing Rights from which
the Collateral arises by any available judicial procedure or without judicial
process, whichever is reasonable under the circumstances, and sell property
acquired as a result of any such foreclosure;

 



 

(vi) the Certificateholder shall act, or contract with one or more third
Persons to act, as servicer, special servicer or subservicer of the Servicing
Rights from which the Collateral arises requiring servicing and perform all
obligations required in connection with the Agency Agreement, and the Servicer
shall pay such third Persons reasonable fees to the extent (if any) that the
Certificateholder is unable, despite reasonable efforts made by the
Certificateholder in light of the necessity that there be no material break in
the continuity of servicing, to contract for such servicing and performance of
such obligations for fees equal to or less than the fees under the Agency
Agreement, _provided_ such third Person reimburses the Servicer for
outstanding advances of principal and interest and other advances reimbursable
under such Agency Agreement to the extent such amounts are owed or pledged to
third parties that provided financing for such advance amounts; and

 



      
 

 



 

(vii) the Certificateholder shall exercise all rights and remedies of a
secured creditor under the UCC or any other relevant jurisdiction, including
selling the interests of the Servicer in the Collateral at public or private
sale. The Certificateholder shall give the Servicer not less than ten (10)
calendar days notice of any such public sale or of the date after which a
private sale may be held, unless the circumstances of the applicable Event of
Default require the immediate transfer of the Collateral. The Servicer agrees
that ten (10) calendar days notice shall be reasonable notice, unless the
circumstances of the applicable Event of Default require the immediate
transfer of the Collateral, in which event the Servicer hereby waives any
right to prior notice. At any such sale the Collateral may be sold as an
entirety or in separate parts, as any Certificateholder may determine. The
Certificateholder may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or
private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be
made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned. The
Certificateholder is authorized at any such sale, if the Certificateholder
deems it advisable so to do, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers
to Persons who are acceptable to the credit rating agencies and other parties
to the Agency Agreement. Upon any such sale, the Certificateholder shall have
the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the
Collateral so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property
sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any
equity or right of redemption, stay or appraisal which the Servicer have or
may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted.
In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or for
future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the
Certificateholder until the selling price is paid by the purchaser, but the
Certificateholder shall not incur any liability in case of such purchasers
failure to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such
failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon like notice. The
Certificateholder may, however, instead of exercising the power of sale herein
conferred upon it, proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to collect
all amounts due upon the Collateral or to foreclose the pledge and sell the
Collateral or any portion of it under a judgment or decree of a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction, or both;

 



 

(viii) The Certificateholder shall not incur any liability as a result of the
sale of the Collateral, or any part of it, at any private sale and so long as
the Certificateholder acts in accordance with any non-waivable requirements
imposed by the UCC, the Servicer hereby waives any claims it may have against
the Certificateholder arising by reason of the fact that the price at which
the Collateral may have been sold at such private sale was less than the price
that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Certificateholder
accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more
than one offeree, but not if the Certificateholder or an affiliate thereof
acquires the Collateral;

 



      
 

 



 

(ix) the Servicer waives any right to require the Certificateholder (A) to
proceed against any Person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any of the
Collateral or pursue its rights and remedies as against the Collateral in any
particular order or (C) pursue any other remedy in its power;

 



 

(x) the Certificateholder may, but shall not be obligated to do any act or
thing necessary to enforce, collect, preserve or reinstate any Collateral and
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements,
incurred or paid by the Certificateholder in exercising any right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement together with interest thereon, shall be
reimbursed by the Servicer.

 



 

(d) In addition, the Servicer shall execute a valid power of attorney ("
**Power of Attorney** ") as of the date of the Subordination of Interest
Agreement to take any actions with respect to the Collateral on the Servicers
behalf. Such Power of Attorney shall only be effective upon an occurrence of
an Event of Default by the Servicer under the Basic Documents.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Basic Document,
nothing herein or therein shall be construed as the Servicers waiver of, or
agreement to waive, any requirement imposed by applicable law that any sale of
Collateral be commercially reasonable.

 



 

6. **_Fidelity Bond; Liability Insurance_**. The Servicer will maintain in effect at all times and at its cost, a blanket fidelity bond and a mortgage impairment policy in a form and at coverage levels acceptable to the Certificateholder. If so requested, the Servicer shall cause certificates evidencing the existence of such coverage to be delivered to the Certificateholder. The Servicer will also maintain an errors and omissions insurance policy with one or more insurers in an amount acceptable to the Certificateholder covering its officers and employees and other Persons acting on its behalf in connection with its activities under the Basic Documents, and (ii) corporate liability insurance in the amount acceptable to the Certificateholder, in each case, subject to increase at the determination of the Certificateholder and under which the Certificateholder will be named both beneficiary and loss payee. The Servicer will promptly report in writing to the Certificateholder any material changes that may occur in its fidelity bond and insurance policies, if any, and, at least once a year, will furnish to the Certificateholder copies of all binders and policies or certificates evidencing that such bonds and insurance policies are in full force and effect.

 



 

7. **_Continuing Security Interest_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in all of the
rights and interests of the Servicer (if any) in the Collateral and such
security interest shall remain in full force and effect until the
Participation Interests issued by the Servicer hereunder have been terminated
pursuant to _Section 8(a)_ of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Any financing statement filed in connection with this Agreement shall
include the provisions required pursuant to the Subordination of Interest
Agreement.

 



 

8. **_Term; Termination_**.

 



 

(a) The (i) Participation Interests to be issued hereunder shall not terminate
and shall continue to entitle the related Owner to the related Excess
Servicing Fee Receivables until the termination of the Agency Agreement and
the payment of all amounts owing thereunder and (ii) security interests
arising hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until the
termination of any and all outstanding Participation Interests. Only after the
termination of each Participation Interest, (i) this Agreement and the
security interests and assignments created hereby shall automatically
terminate and all rights to the Collateral as shall not have been sold or
otherwise disposed of or applied pursuant to the terms hereof shall revert to
the Servicer and (ii) the Certificateholder, will, upon the Servicers request
and at the Servicers expense, without any representation, warranty or
recourse whatsoever, (A) return to the Servicer all of the Collateral as shall
not have been sold or otherwise disposed of or applied pursuant to the terms
hereof and (B) execute and deliver to the Servicer such documents as the
Servicer shall reasonably request to evidence such termination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the agreements set forth in this _Section 8(a)_ and _Section
8(b)_ and _Section 9_ of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) If the Servicer is terminated for cause or resigns as servicer under the
Agency Agreement, the Servicer shall pay over to the Certificateholder the
fair value of the lost Excess Servicing Fee Receivables that it otherwise
would have received pursuant to the terms of the Agency Agreement. If the
Servicer receives any termination fee for termination of its role as servicer
under the Agency Agreement, the Servicer shall pay over to the
Certificateholder the portion (up to 100%) of such termination fee, not
exceeding the fair value of the lost Excess Servicing Fee Receivables with
respect to the Agency Agreement.

 



 

(c) All remedies afforded to the parties hereto by reason of this Agreement or
the other Basic Documents, or otherwise available at law or in equity, are
separate and cumulative remedies and it is agreed that no one remedy, whether
or not exercised by any party hereto (including without limitation, any right
to terminate the Term or this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8_),
shall be deemed to be in exclusion of any other remedy available to such
exercising party and shall not limit or prejudice any other legal or equitable
remedy which such exercising party may have in connection with a default of an
opposite partys covenants and agreements hereunder, or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The term of this Agreement until termination under this _Section 8_ is
referred to herein as the " **Term**."

 



 

9. **_Indemnification_**. Except as otherwise stated herein, the Servicer shall indemnify and hold the Certificateholder and its officers, directors, shareholders and affiliates (the

 



      
 

 



 

" **Certificateholder Indemnified Parties** ") harmless from any liabilities,
claims, losses or Damages (as defined below), including reasonable attorneys
fees, directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of (i) the
Servicers willful misfeasance, bad faith or fraud, and (ii) the Servicers
failure to observe or perform any or all of the Servicers covenants,
agreements, warranties or representations contained in this Agreement. For
purposes hereof, " **Damages** " shall mean any and all assessments,
judgments, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, damages or expenses (including
interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements
in connection with any action, suit or proceeding and including any such
reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements incurred in enforcing
any right of indemnification against any indemnitor); _provided_ that Damages
shall not include punitive, consequential, exemplary or special damages (other
than punitive, consequential, exemplary and special damages required to be
paid by the indemnified party under this Agreement to anyone (other than a
party to this Agreement) arising out of an action or proceeding, which damages
shall be deemed to be direct damages to the party required to pay such
punitive, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages); and _provided
further_ that losses resulting from the termination of all or any portion of
the servicing or subservicing under the Agency Agreement shall not be deemed
to be consequential, exemplary or incidental damages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any indemnification from the Servicer for losses resulting from the
termination of the servicing under the Agency Agreement shall be non-recourse
(except to the extent the termination results from the acts or omissions of
the Servicer or any of its affiliates or any of their respective officers or
employees), and the Certificateholders remedy for any such termination shall
be limited solely to the Collateral as described in Section 5(c) herein.

 



 

10. **_Books, Records and Reports._**

 



 

(a) The Servicer shall keep or cause to be kept complete and accurate books
and records of the Servicer and supporting documentation of the transactions
with respect to the conduct of the Servicers business. The records shall
include, but not be limited to, copies of the Servicers organizational
documents and all amendments thereto, a current list of the names and last
known business, residence or mailing addresses of all Owners, a current list
of all Excess Servicing Fee Receivables and related Investment Pools, and the
Servicers Federal, state or local tax returns.

 



 

(b) The books and records shall be maintained in accordance with sound
accounting practices and shall be available at the Servicers principal office
for examination by any Owner or such Owners duly authorized representative
upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours.

 



 

(c) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall deliver the distribution date report in substantially the form
of _Exhibit D_ hereto (the " **Servicer Distribution Date Report** ").

 



 

11. **_Notices_**. All notices, demands, waivers, and other communications required or permitted by this Agreement, together with all reports, statements, and other documents and materials required hereunder, shall in each case be in writing (whether or not a writing is expressly required hereby), and shall be deemed to have been given if and when personally delivered or

Agreement.

DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (OR THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR

BASIC DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS WAIVER OF THE
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, BY THE
SERVICER AND THE CERTIFICATEHOLDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS EACH INSTANCE

Re: Master Participation Agreement dated as of [ ]; Purchase Offer

assets into cash or other liquidated property.

 



 

With respect to the sale of the Excess Servicing Fee Receivables from the
