   ARTICLE 1 
   

  



  

   THE MERGER   

  



  

  Section 1.01. _The  Merger._  

  



  

  (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth  in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary  shall be merged (the
"Merger") with and into  the Company in accordance with Florida Law,
whereupon the  separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the

  (b) Subject to the provisions of _Article 8_, the  closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall  take place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, P.A.,
333 Avenue  of the Americas, Suite 4400, Miami, Florida, as soon as

provisions of Florida Law. The Merger shall become effective at  such time
(the "Effective Time") as the  Articles of Merger are duly filed with the
Secretary of State of 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  the State of Florida (or at such later time as permitted by  Florida Law
as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall be  specified in the Articles
of Merger). 

  



  

  (d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this  Agreement and
in the applicable provisions of Florida Law.  Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing and subject  thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall  possess all the properties, rights, powers, privileges
and  franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,  liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and  Merger Subsidiary, all as
provided under Florida Law. 

  



  

  Section 1.02. _Conversion  of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of  the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger 
Subsidiary or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock  or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary: 

  



  

  (a) except as otherwise provided in  _Section 1.02(b)_, or _Section 1.04_,
each  share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to  the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive  a combination of
(i) 0.0414 of a validly issued, fully paid  and nonassessable share of Parent
Common Stock (such per share  amount, the "Stock Consideration") and  (ii)
$6.25 in cash, without interest (such per share  amount, the "Cash
Consideration" and, together  with the Stock Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to 
_Section 1.06(b)_, the "Merger  Consideration"). As of the Effective Time,
all such  shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding  and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,  and each
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective  Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each,  a "Certificate") and each
uncertificated share  of Company Common Stock (an "Uncertificated  Share")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time  was registered to a holder on
the stock transfer books of the  Company, shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive  the Merger Consideration; 

  



  

  (b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company  or any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or owned by Parent or  any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made  with respect thereto; 

  



  

  (c) each share of capital stock of Parent outstanding  immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding  and shall not be affected by
the Merger; and 

  



  

  (d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into and become
one share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and  privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the 
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation. 

  



  

  Section 1.03. _Surrender  and Payment._  

  



  

  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a  commercial bank
or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory  to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the  purpose of paying the Merger Consideration to the
holders of  Company Common Stock and shall enter into an Exchange Agent 
Agreement that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company with  the Exchange
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent  shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange  Agent, for the benefit (from and after the
Effective Time) of  the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
payment and  exchange in accordance with this _Section 1.03_  through the
Exchange Agent, (i) book-entry shares (which,  to the extent subsequently
requested, shall be exchanged for  certificates) representing the total
number of shares of Parent  Common Stock issuable as Stock Consideration and
(ii) cash  sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration. In addition, 
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the  Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to  make payments in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to  _Section 1.06(b)_ and to pay any
dividends or other  distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.03(f)_. 
All book-entry shares and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent  pursuant to
this _Section 1.03(a)_ shall herewith be  referred to as the "Exchange Fund".
Promptly  after the Effective Time (and in any event within two Business 
Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall  cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each Person who was,  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of  shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive payment of  the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.02(a)_  a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify 
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or  transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for  use in such payment. 

  



  

  (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have  been
converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon  (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate,  together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or 
(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the  Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as  the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a  book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger 
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented  by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered  or transferred, as
the case may be, each such Certificate or  Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time  for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger  Consideration. 

  



  

  (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be  paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the  surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share  is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that  (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or  shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such  Uncertificated
Share shall be properly transferred and  (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the  Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required
as a result  of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of  such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the 
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid  or is not
payable. 

  



  

  (d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed  immediately
upon the Effective Time and there shall be no  further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common  Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are  presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange  Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and converted into  the right to
receive only the Merger Consideration to the extent  provided for, and in
accordance with and subject to the  procedures set forth, in this _Article
1_. 

  



  

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available  to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_  that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company  Common Stock six months after the Effective
Time shall be  delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of
Parent,  and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company  Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with  this _Section 1.03_
prior to that time shall  thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger  Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest 
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be  liable to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any  amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable  abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts  remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock  immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise 
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority  shall become, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the  property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of  any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made  with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the  Effective Time, and no
payment in lieu of fractional shares  pursuant to _Section 1.06(b)_, will be
paid to the  holders of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated 
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable upon
surrender thereof until the holder of such  Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall surrender such  Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in
accordance with the  terms of this _Section 1.03_. Subject to Applicable 
Law, promptly following the surrender of any such Certificates  or
Uncertificated Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to  the holders
thereof, without interest, any dividends or other  distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and  theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent  Common Stock and, at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of  dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the  Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date 
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole  shares of
Parent Common Stock. 

  



  

  Section 1.04. _Dissenting  Shares._ Notwithstanding any provision in
this  Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by  a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented  thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded appraisal for  such shares in accordance with Sections
607.1301 through  607.1333 of Florida Law (collectively, the "Dissenting 
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration. From and after the Effective 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not have, and shall  not be
entitled to exercise, any of the voting rights or other  rights of a holder
of shares of the Surviving Corporation. If,  after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect,  withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under 
Section 607.1302 of Florida Law, such shares shall be  treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time  into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company  shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the  Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the
right  to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such 
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the  Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to  settle or settle, any such
demands. 

  



  

  Section 1.05. _Stock  Options._  

  



  

  (a) __Stock Plan_._ Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable actions  (including obtaining any necessary determinations 
and/or  resolutions of the board of directors of the Company (the  "Company
Board") or a committee thereof and  amending the Stock Plan) to terminate the
Stock Plan without any  further liability on the part of the Company, the
Surviving  Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (b) __Options_._ Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall take all
reasonable actions  (including obtaining any necessary determinations 
and/or  resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof) to  provide
that each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or  not then exercisable
or vested, shall become fully vested and be  cancelled pursuant to the terms
of the Stock Plan in exchange  for the right to receive the Option
Consideration (including  without limitation the delivery by the Company of a
written  "cancellation notice" to each holder of a Company  Stock Option no
later than 30 days prior to the Effective  Time). At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock  Option, whether or not then exercisable or vested,
shall become  fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to 
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective  Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the  total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such  Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time,  multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (x) $6.45 
over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common  Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option, without interest and  less any applicable taxes
required to be withheld with respect  to such payment (the "Option
Consideration").  As used herein, the term "Company Stock Option"  shall
mean any outstanding option to purchase shares of Company  Common Stock
granted under the Stock Plan or otherwise. As of  the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option for which the  exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock exceeds the  Merger Consideration (based on a valuation of the
Stock  Consideration as set forth in clause (x) of  _Section 1.05(b)_) shall
be canceled and have no  further effect, with no right to receive any
consideration  therefor. As of the Effective Time, all other Company Stock 
Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically  cease to
exist and shall become only the right to receive the  Option Consideration
described in this  _Section 1.05(b)_, and, without limiting the  foregoing,
the Company Board or the appropriate committee  thereof shall take all
necessary action to effect such  cancellation. 

  



  

  Section 1.06. _Adjustments;  Fractional Shares._  

  



  

  (a) If, during the period between the date of this  Agreement and the
Effective Time (i) any change in the  outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock shall occur, as a  result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split  (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange 
or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar  transaction, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date  during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other  amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be  appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on  the
Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable  pursuant to this
Agreement or (ii) any change in the  outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall occur as a  result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split  (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange 
or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar  transaction, or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date  during such period, the Stock
Consideration pursuant to this  Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to
eliminate the  effect of such event on the Stock Consideration payable
pursuant  to this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 1.06(a)_  shall be
construed to limit any restrictions that may arise  under other provisions of
this Agreement on actions of the  Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that  would cause such an adjustment. 

  



  

  (b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares  of Parent
Common Stock or book-entry credit of same will be  issued upon the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company  Common Stock, but in lieu thereof each
holder of Company Common  Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share  of Parent Common 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Stock upon surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock (after 
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be  received by
such holder) shall receive an amount of cash  (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal  to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the average  closing price, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
a cent, of  Parent Common Stock as reported by the NYSE Amex for the five 
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. Payment  shall occur as
soon as practicable after the determination of  the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to each former holder of  Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional shares and  following compliance with the surrender and payment
procedures  set forth in _Section 1.03_ and in the letter of  transmittal.
No dividend or distribution with respect to Parent  Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any  fractional shares and such fractional
share interest shall not  entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a
shareholder of  Parent. 

  



  

  Section 1.07. _Withholding  Rights._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent
and  the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person  pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to  deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment  under any provision of any Applicable Law,
including federal,  state, local or foreign Tax law, and if any such amounts
are  deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the  Surviving
Corporation to, as the case may be, timely pay such  amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. If the  Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case  may be, so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for  all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder  of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
the  Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case  may
be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  



  

  Section 1.08. _Lost  Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been 
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of  that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving  Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such  reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct (or in 
such customary amount as the Exchange Agent may direct in  accordance with
its standard procedures), as indemnity against  any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such  Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue,
in exchange for such  lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration  to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock 
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this  _Article 1_. 

  



  

   ARTICLE 2 
   

  



  

   THE  SURVIVING CORPORATION   

  



  

  Section 2.01. _Articles  of Incorporation._ The articles of

  Section 2.02. _Bylaws._ The  bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the
Effective Time  shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

  Section 5.02. _No  Solicitation; Other Offers._  

  



  

  (a) The Company represents that, effective June 3,  2011, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and their respective  Affiliates and Representatives,
ceased any discussions,  activities or negotiations with any Person or
Persons (other  than Parent or Merger Sub or their Representatives) that
may  have been ongoing at that time with respect to any Acquisition 
Proposal or seeking an Acquisition Proposal and, through the  date hereof,
none of them conducted any such discussions, or  engaged in any such
activities or negotiations. Subject to  _Section 5.02(b)_ and _Section
5.02(e)_,  from and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the 
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
9.01_: 

  



  

  (i) the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees,  investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants and  other authorized agents, advisors or
representatives  (collectively, "Representatives") not to,  directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or take any  action to knowingly facilitate
or encourage the submission of  any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or
participate in  any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information  relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford 
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of  the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party that  is seeking to make, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (C)  (1) withdraw, modify or amend, or
announce that it proposes  to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse
to the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company Board 
Recommendation or (2) approve or recommend, or announce  that it proposes to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition  Proposal (any of the foregoing in this
clause (C), a  "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"),  (D) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of  intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, or  other similar instrument (whether or not binding)
constituting  or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (E) grant any 
waiver or release under any standstill, confidentiality or  similar agreement
entered into by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives in  connection with any actual or potential
Acquisition  Proposal; and 

  



  

  (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  and its and
their respective Representatives to, cease  immediately and terminate
immediately any and all existing  activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third  Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the  approval of the
Shareholders of the Company contemplated by  _Section 7.01(d)_, if the
Company or its  Representatives receive a bona fide unsolicited written 
Acquisition Proposal (that was not made as a consequence of any  violation of
_Section 5.02_ or of any standstill,  confidentiality or similar agreement
entered into by the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates or  Representatives), the Company or its Representatives may 
participate in discussions with, request clarifications from, or  furnish
information to, any Person that makes such bona fide  unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal if (A) such action  is taken subject to a
confidentiality agreement with the Company  containing provisions that are no
less restrictive than the  comparable provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (and does  not omit restrictive provisions contained in the
Confidentiality  Agreement), (B) the Company Board reasonably determines in 
good faith, after consultation with a nationally recognized  financial
advisor and outside nationally recognized legal  counsel (which may be the
Companys current outside legal  counsel), that the transaction that is the
subject of the  Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to
lead  to, a Superior Proposal and (C) the Company Board  reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with  outside nationally
recognized legal counsel (which may be the  Companys current outside legal
counsel), that there is a  reasonable likelihood that failure to take such
actions would be  inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law. 

  



  

  (c) The Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent  permitted under
Applicable Law, the provisions of any  standstill, confidentiality or similar
agreement entered into by  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective  Representatives in connection with any actual or potential 
Acquisition Proposal, including where

  necessary, seeking to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches  of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and  provisions thereof in
any court having jurisdiction. 

  



  

  (d) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company  Board from
complying with requirements of  Rule 14e-2(a)  under the 1934 Act or
complying with the requirements of  Rule 14d-9  under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal,  so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is  consistent with _Section 5.02(a)_. For the avoidance 
of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" or similar  communication of the type
contemplated by  Rule 14d-9(f)  under the 1934 Act, an express rejection of
any applicable  Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its 
recommendation to the shareholders of the Company in favor of  the Merger
shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse  Recommendation Change. 

  



  

  (e) The Company Board shall not (i) effect a Company  Adverse
Recommendation Change, (ii) cause the Company to  accept any Acquisition
Proposal  and/or enter  into any agreement in principle, letter of intent,
term sheet,  merger agreement, acquisition agreement, or other similar 
instrument (whether or not binding) constituting or relating to  an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve to do any of the  foregoing;
__provided, however,__ that the Company  Board shall be entitled to effect a
Company Adverse  Recommendation Change prior to the time the shareholders of
the  Company adopt this Agreement as contemplated by  _Section 7.01(d)_ if
(x) the Company has complied  with its obligations under this _Section
5.02_,  (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after  consultation
with (1) a nationally recognized financial  advisor and outside nationally
recognized legal counsel (which  may be the Companys current outside legal
counsel), that  the transaction that is the subject of the Acquisition
Proposal,  if any, is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a 
Superior Proposal and (2) outside nationally recognized  legal counsel (which
may be the Companys current outside  legal counsel), that there is a
reasonable likelihood that  failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its  fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (z) at least five 
Business Days prior to taking such action, the Company Board  shall have
advised Parent in writing that the Company Board  intends to consider
withdrawing, modifying or amending its  Company Board Recommendation together
with the specific reasons  therefore, given Parent an opportunity to appear
before it at a  meeting (which may be telephonic or by video conference and
of  which Parent will have been given at least three Business  Days prior
notice) and present reasons why the Company  Board should not withdraw,
modify or amend its Company Board  Recommendation and negotiate in good faith
with Parent with the  intent of enabling the parties to agree to a
modification of the  terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Transactions  will be on the terms such that the Company Board shall not be 
obligated to, and shall not, withdraw, modify or amend its  Company Board
Recommendation. Any such withdrawal, modification  or amendment shall not
include changing the approval of the  Company Board for purposes of causing
any Anti-takeover Statute  or other similar Applicable Law to be applicable
to the Merger.  Unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to 
_Section 9.01(e)_ or _Section 9.01(g)_ or  otherwise, nothing contained in
this _Section 5.02(e)_  shall affect the Companys obligation to hold and
convene  the Company Shareholder Meeting and to submit this Agreement for 
adoption by the shareholders of the Company (regardless of  whether the
Company Board Recommendation shall have been  withdrawn, modified or
amended). 

  



  

  (f) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no  event later than
twenty-four hours) after receipt by the Company  (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any  inquiry that could be
reasonably expected to lead to an  Acquisition Proposal or of any request for
information relating  to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the  business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that to the Knowledge  of the
Company may be considering making, or has made, an  Acquisition Proposal,
which notice shall be provided in writing  and shall identify the person
making, and the terms and  conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request  (including any material changes thereto and copies of
any  written materials received from such Third Party or its 
Representatives in connection therewith). The Company shall keep  Parent
fully informed of any material change to any Acquisition  Proposal, inquiry
or request for information. The Company shall  promptly provide to Parent any
non-public information concerning  the Company provided to any other Person
in connection with any  Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to
any  Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which was not previously  provided
or made available to Parent. 

  



  

  (g) The Company shall promptly request in writing that each  Person that
has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement  in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company or  any portion thereof in the twelve
months prior to the date  hereof, return to the Company all materials
containing  confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by 
or on behalf of the Company or destroy such materials.

  (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective  Time and subject
to Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall  cause its Subsidiaries to,
upon reasonable notice and request,  (i) give to Parent and its
Representatives and the  Financing Parties reasonable access during normal
business hours  to its offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish 
to Parent and its Representatives and the Financing Parties,  such financial
and operating data and other information as such  Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct its  Representatives to cooperate with Parent and
its Representatives  and the Financing Parties in its investigation;
__provided,  however,__ that all such notices or requests by Parent and  its
Representatives shall be made directly to the Chief  Financial Officer of the
Company or his designees;  __provided, further, however__ , that prior to
the  disclosure of any such information or granting of any such  access to a
Financing Party, either such Financing Party shall  have entered into a
reasonably acceptable confidentiality  agreement with the Company or Parent
shall have entered into a  written agreement, whereby it agrees to be fully
responsible for  the disclosure of any such information by any such
Financing  Party in breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any 
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.03_ shall be  conducted in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with  the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_
shall, prior  to the Effective Time, require the Company to take any action 
that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company,  constitute a waiver
of the attorney-client or similar privilege  or trade secret protection held
by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality
obligations owing to  Third Parties; __provided__ _, _however_ ,_  that the
Company shall make a good faith effort to accommodate  any request from
Parent and its Representatives for access or  information pursuant to this
_Section 5.03_ in a  manner that does not result in such a waiver or
violation  (including by entering into joint defense or similar agreements 
with respect thereto). 

  



  

  (b) All information furnished pursuant to this  _Section 5.03_ shall be
subject to the letter  agreement dated December 20, 2006 as amended by
letter  agreements dated March 25, 2008, April 7, 2008,  February 5, 2010
(and reaffirmed on June 3,  2011) and June 15, 2011, between Parent and the 
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The  parties acknowledge and agree
that nothing in the  Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict
Parent  from engaging in discussions and negotiations or making  proposals
as contemplated by _Section 5.02(e)_. 

  



  

  Section 5.04. _Shareholder  Litigation._ The Company shall not settle
any  shareholder litigation against the Company  and/or its  directors
relating to this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereunder
without Parents prior written  consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed  or conditioned) and the Company shall use its reasonable
best  efforts to keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the  status
of, and any material developments in, any such litigation. 

  



  

  Section 5.05. _Real  Estate Matters._ Parent, at its sole discretion  and
expense, may order preliminary title reports from one or  more nationally
recognized title companies (the  "Title Companies") with respect to any of 
the Real Property (the Real Property covered by such reports  being referred
to herein as the "Titled  Property"). The Company, at no expense to the
Company,  shall use reasonable best efforts in connection with  Parents
efforts to obtain title insurance policies  pursuant thereto on behalf of
itself  and/or the  Financing Parties, including, by providing customary
affidavits  and indemnities as are required by the Title Companies and  in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company for the deletion  or modification
of standard or printed exceptions regarding  construction liens, parties in
possession and unrecorded title  matters so as to remove the "gap" in any
title  insurance policies issued pursuant thereto, that are customarily 
deleted by virtue of a seller delivering such instruments in  commercial real
estate transactions in the state or province in  which the Titled Property is
located. Such cooperation shall  include providing Parent and the Title
Companies copies of,  with respect to Titled Property, reasonably requested
existing  surveys, existing title commitments and title insurance  policies,
to the extent the same are in the possession of the  Company or its
Subsidiaries and to the extent the same are not  publicly available. Neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries  shall have any obligation to cure any title
matters. 

  



  

  Section 5.06. _D andO  Insurance._ Prior to the Effective Time, the 
Company shall purchase a prepaid six-year officers and  directors "tail"
liability policy  ("DandO Insurance") on terms and conditions  that are
substantially similar to the Companys existing  officers and directors
liability policy and  providing coverage benefits that are not materially
more or less  favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the Companys 
current such policy.

  Section 5.07. _Rule 16b-3._ The  Company shall, and shall be permitted to,
take all actions to  cause any dispositions of equity securities of the
Company by  each individual who is a director or officer of the Company,
and  who would otherwise be subject to  Rule 16b-3  under the 1934 Act, to
be exempt under  Rule 16b-3  under the 1934 Act. 

  



  

  Section 5.08. _Company  Board of Directors._ Prior to the Closing, the 
Company shall obtain the resignation of each of the officers and  directors
of the Board of Directors of the Company effective  upon the Effective
Time. 

  



  

  Section 5.09. _Evidence  of Closing Cash and Adjustment Amount._

  (c) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or  failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or  agreement on the part of Parent or

the  Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior  Proposal, and
the Company Board continues to reasonably  determine in good faith, after

and enter into an agreement to effect  the Superior Proposal in order for the
Company Board to comply  with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and
(z)  (A) prior to such termination, Parent has received Expense 
Reimbursement and the Termination Fee by wire transfer in same  day funds and
(B) simultaneously or substantially  simultaneously with such termination,
