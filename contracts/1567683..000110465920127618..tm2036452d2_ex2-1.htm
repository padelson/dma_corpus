Purchaser will, at Seller's election: (a) assign to Seller any rights to any
contribution available under any rights to insurance claims or recoveries
available under insurance policies covering such Facility; or (b) at Seller's

which the Purchase Price was reduced in accordance with this _Section 5.03_ ,

related items that result in Losses that are subject to indemnification in

cash Taxes payable that would otherwise be due or the receipt of a refund of
Taxes by the Indemnified Parties, in each case only with respect to the
taxable year in which the Loss was incurred or paid) to the Indemnified Party

amount equal to such Tax benefit; _provided_ that such payment shall not
exceed the amount of the indemnity payment.

shall specify the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising
therefrom. The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party
copies of all material notices and documents (including court papers) received
or transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The failure
or delay of the Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim
shall not affect the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was actually
disadvantaged by such failure or delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

  



  

   

24

the defense of any claim by a third party which may give rise to
indemnity hereunder pursuant to _Section 11.06(d)_ , the Indemnified Party
shall not settle, consent to the entry of a judgment of or compromise such
claim without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

11.06   _Rights of Indemnifying Party in the Defense of Third Party
Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Right to Assume the Defense_. In connection with any claim
by a third party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after the date the
Indemnifying Party is notified of such claim by the Indemnified Party to
assume the defense of any such claim, which defense shall be prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settlement in accordance with the
terms hereof.

  



  

(b) _Procedure_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such
claim and (ii) take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof,
at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such claim, with its own
counsel and at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ , that, if the claim
includes allegations for which the Indemnifying Party both would and would
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall in that case jointly assume the defense
thereof. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall fully
cooperate with each other and their respective counsel in the defense or
settlement of such claim. The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the
other Party appraised at all times as to the status of the defense or any
settlement negotiations with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Settlement of Losses_. The Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to a settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such claim or legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  



  

(d) _Decline to Assume the Defense_. The Indemnified Party may
defend against any such claim, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, in such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate,
including settling such claim in accordance with the terms hereof if (i) the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim resulting
therefrom within thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is
notified of such claim by the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party is (a) not diligently
defending the Indemnified Person, (b) not contesting such claim in good
faith through appropriate proceedings or (c) has not taken such action
(including the posting of a bond, deposit or other security) as may be
necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a Lien against or attachment of
any asset or property of the Indemnified Party for payment of such claim.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

11.07   _Direct Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party has a
claim against any Indemnifying Party which may give rise to indemnity
hereunder that does not involve a claim brought by a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim
and the facts constituting the basis for such claim and, if known, the amount
or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days from receipt of such claim notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes
such claim, the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability
of the Indemnifying Party hereunder; however if the Indemnifying Party does
notify the Indemnified Party that it disputes such claim within the require
thirty (30) day period, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective Parties with respect to such claim. If the
Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both Parties. If such Parties shall not agree, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to take any action in law or in equity as
such Indemnified Party shall deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this
_Article 11_ against the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

11.08   _Exclusive Remedy_. Absent fraud or willful breach, the
indemnities set forth in this _Article 11_ shall be the exclusive remedies
of Purchaser and Seller and their respective members, officers, directors,
employees, agents and Affiliates due to misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, nonfulfillment or failure to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, and the Parties shall not be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights
or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the
Parties hereto hereby waive.

  



  

11.09   _Indemnity Treatment_. Any amount of indemnification payable
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 11 _shall to the extent
possible, be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

11.10   _Mitigation_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of
any event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

  



  

(b) Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article 11_ , the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the
Indemnified Party may have against any third parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim and the Indemnified Party
shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

11.11   _No Solicitation_. Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or
permit the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of its Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or

occur and money damages may not be a sufficient remedy. In addition to any

condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to

Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not
alternative.

jurisdiction.

  



  

   

30

(i)  any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Action or Proceeding arising out of or relating to

13.16   _Disclosures_. Any Party may, at its option, include in the
Disclosure Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items
are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further
the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall
the inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules be deemed or
interpreted to broaden Seller's or Purchaser's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an
item in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission by a Party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event, or
circumstance.

executed by facsimile signature in any number of counterparts, each of which
