continue to operate in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the

Parties acknowledge that on January 27, 2012, PRIII Member gave ESS a "Sale

(a) PRIII Member shall be deemed to have withdrawn the Sale Notice with the

right to sell its "Entire Interest" (as defined in the JV Agreement) pursuant
to Section 9.2 of the JV Agreement.

 



 

(c) Until the termination of this Agreement, PRIII Member shall not have any

Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.3 _Certain Notices_**. From the date hereof until Closing, each
Party shall promptly inform the other Parties in writing of (a) any event or
occurrence that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect
on its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to execute,
deliver or perform the other Closing Documents to which it is a party or (b)
any breach of its representations and warranties that cannot or will not be
cured by the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 5.4 _Transfer Taxes_**. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection
with this consummation and Closing of the Transaction shall be paid by either
PRIII Member or ESS in accordance with the custom of the location of the
applicable Property. The provisions of this Section 5.4 shall survive the
Closing and not be merged therein.

 



 

 **Section 5.5 _Other Transaction Costs_**. All costs of title insurance
shall be paid by ESS, except that PRIII Member shall pay half of the actual
costs of the so-called owners extended coverage title insurance premium
(including such endorsements to such owners policies as ESS may, in ESS sole
discretion, request) incurred by ESS at Closing in those states in which it is
custom that a seller of real property pay the costs of base title insurance,
provided, however, in no event shall PRIII Member pay an amount in excess of
$160,000 in title insurance costs in connection with this Transaction. ESS
shall pay the cost of any surveys or survey updates. Each Party shall pay its
own legal fees and disbursements in connection with the Transaction. ESS shall
pay one-half of Escrow Agents escrow fee and PRIII Member shall pay

 



      
 

 



 

one-half of Escrow Agents escrow fee. Except as otherwise specified herein,
each Party shall bear any costs and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with the Transaction.

 



 

 **Section 5.6 _Prorations_**. All prorations of real estate taxes, rents and
other items, to be prorated shall be made as of 12:00 p.m. on June 30, 2012
(the " **Proration Date** ") taking into account income and expenses through
and including June 30, 2012. Prorations shall be based on the Parties then
best estimate of such amounts taking into account all then available
information. At least five (5) days prior to Closing, PRIII Member shall
provide ESS its good faith determination of the Purchase Price as set forth
herein. ESS shall review and approve such determination promptly and prior to
Closing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding that the Closing Date is July 2, 2012, all prorations will be
done as of the Proration Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, ESS shall be
entitled to all income and obligated for all expenses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries beginning as of July 1, 2012.

 



 

 **Section 5.7 _Post-Closing Collections_**. " **Delinquent Rents** " shall
not be prorated and shall remain the property of the JV. PRIII Member shall
not have any interest in or right to Delinquent Rents after the Closing. As
used herein, " **Delinquent Rents** " means all rent due and other revenue
payable to the JV or any of the Subsidiaries as of the Proration Date and
applicable, on an accrual basis, to any period of time preceding the Proration
Date, including, but not limited to, checks received after the Proration Date,
but applicable to a period occurring prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, PRIII Member shall
be entitled to a credit at Closing in the amount of $100,000 to account for
the fact that the parties agree not to prorate Delinquent Rents (the "
**Delinquent Rents Credit** ").

 



 

 **Section 5.8 _Post Closing Adjustment_**. No later than January 31, 2013
(the " **Post Closing Adjustment Date** "), ESS shall (a) prepare and provide
to PRIII Member a final accounting for the operations of the JV and the
Subsidiaries through the Proration Date (the " **Final Accounting** ") and (b)
recalculate the prorations and adjustments to the Purchase Price as of the
Proration Date, excluding the Delinquent Rents Credit which shall not be
subject to adjustment (the " **Proration Recalculation** ") and provide a copy
of the Proration Recalculation to PRIII Member. ESS and PRIII Member shall
each have an opportunity to provide the other with a review (a " **Review** ")
of the Final Accounting and/or the Proration Recalculation setting forth in
reasonable detail any discrepancy which it has discovered in the prorations
made as of the Proration Date or in either the Final Accounting or the
Proration Recalculation. If ESS or PRIII Member does not provide the other
party with a Review within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final
Accounting and the Proration Recalculation, such party shall be deemed to be
in agreement with the Final Accounting and the Proration Recalculation. If
either party to which any such Review is presented disagrees with such Review,
it shall give written notice (the " **Disagreement Notice** ") to the other
party within ten (10) business days after receipt of such Review (and, if no
such notice is given, the party to which such Review was presented shall be
deemed to agree with the Review). The Disagreement Notice shall state in
reasonable detail all points of disagreement. If ESS and PRIII Member do not
resolve such disagreement within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Disagreement Notice, the matter(s) shall be referred to PriceWaterhouse
Coopers for final determination with the costs of such accountant to be paid
50% by PRIII Member and 50% by ESS. If the parties agree or are deemed to
agree with either the Final Accounting and the Proration Recalculation or the
Review or if there is a determination by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, then the
party in whose favor any error was made shall pay to the

 



      
 

 



 

other party, in cash, the amount owed within ten (10) days of the date of such
agreement or deemed agreement or such determination, as applicable. The
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the Closing and not be merged
therein.

 



 

 **Section 5.9 _Repayment of the Loan; Indemnity Agreement_.** The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Subsidiaries shall continue to be obligated for
the repayment of the Loan after the Closing and the assets of the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall continue to secure the repayment of the Loan after the
Closing. At Closing ESS shall cause Extra Space Storage Inc. to enter into an
indemnity agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "
**Indemnity Agreement** ") for the benefit of PRIII Member. The provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall survive the Closing and not be merged therein.

 



 

 **Section 5.10 _Filing of Final Tax Returns_**. ESS shall, at the JVs
expense and in a timely manner, prepare and file final tax returns for the JV,
the Subsidiaries and the Properties in accordance with applicable state and
federal laws. ESS shall provide drafts of the final tax returns for review and
approval by PRIII Member prior to the filing of such tax returns. The
obligations set forth this Section 5.10 shall survive Closing and not be
merged therein.

 



 

 **Section 5.11 _As-Is Sale_**. ESS acknowledges and agrees as follows:

 



 

(a) Prior to ESSs execution of this Agreement, ESS has conducted (or has
waived its right to conduct) all such due diligence as ESS considered
necessary or appropriate (including due diligence with respect to hazardous
materials or the environmental condition of the Properties).

 



 

(b) Except for PRIII Members Warranties, the Interests shall be sold, and ESS
shall accept possession of the Interests on the Closing Date, "AS IS, WHERE
IS, WITH ALL FAULTS", with no right of setoff or reduction in the Purchase
Price.

 



 

(c) Except for PRIII Members Warranties, PRIII Member shall not be deemed to
have made any verbal or written representations, warranties, promises or
guarantees (whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise) to ESS with
respect to the Interests or the Properties.

 



 

(d) Except for PRIII Members Warranties, upon which ESS has relied in making
ESS decision to purchase the Interests, ESS has independently confirmed to
its satisfaction all information that it considers material to its purchase of
the Interests or the Transaction.

 



 

 **In addition, ESS expressly understands and acknowledges that it is possible
that unknown Liabilities may exist with respect to the Interests and Property
and that with the exception of matters covered by PRIII Member s Warranties,
ESS explicitly took that possibility into account in determining and agreeing
to the Purchase Price, and that a portion of such consideration, having been

unknown Liabilities shall be given in exchange for a full accord and
satisfaction and discharge of all such Liabilities. The terms of this Section
5.11 shall survive the Closing and not be merged therein.**

of their duties for and on behalf of PRIII Member, would have knowledge of the
matters which are the subject of the PRIII Members Limited Warranties.

 



 

 **Section 6.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_**. The
representations and warranties of ESS set forth in Section 6.1 shall survive
the Closing and not be merged therein. PRIII Members Other Warranties shall
survive the Closing and not be merged therein. PRIII Members Limited
Warranties shall survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year following
the Closing and PRIII Member shall only be liable to ESS hereunder for a
breach of the PRIII Members Limited Warranties with respect to which a claim
is made by ESS in writing against PRIII Member on or before the date that is
one (1) year following the date of the Closing. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate liability of PRIII Member
for breaches of PRIII Members Limited Warranties shall be limited as set
forth in Section 6.4 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the
Closing occurs, ESS hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any
right or remedy available to it at law, in equity, under this Agreement or
otherwise to make a claim against PRIII Member for damages that ESS may incur,
or to rescind this Agreement and the Transaction, as the result of any of
PRIII Members Warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect if (i) ESS had
actual knowledge that such representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate
or incorrect at the time of the Closing or (ii) ESSs damages as a result of
such representation or warranty being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect are
reasonably estimated to aggregate less than $50,000. Furthermore, if the
Closing occurs, PRIII Member hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and
releases any right or remedy available to it at law, in equity, under this
Agreement or otherwise to make a claim against ESS for damages that PRIII
Member may incur, or to rescind this Agreement and the Transaction, as the
result of any of the representations or warranties of ESS set forth in Section
6.1 above being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect if at the time of Closing
PRIII Member had actual knowledge that such representation or warranty was
untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of the Closing. For the purposes
of this Section 6.3 only, "actual knowledge" of ESS as used in this Section
6.3 shall refer only to the actual knowledge of Charley Allen, Tim Arthurs,
Scott Stubbs, Mackay Reid, David Rassmussen or Steven Tyler.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.4 _Maximum Aggregate Liability_**. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Closing Documents, the

 **Section 7.1 _Conditions for the Benefit of ESS_**. The obligation of ESS
to consummate the Closing and the Transaction shall be subject to the
fulfillment at or before the Closing of all of the following conditions, any
or all of which may be waived by ESS in its sole and absolute discretion:

authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other documents referenced herein and the consummation of the Transaction
shall have been duly and validly taken.

the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
documents referenced herein and the consummation of the Transaction shall have

date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of
each such date.

 



 

(d) There shall be no injunctions or other orders in effect preventing the
consummation of the Transaction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII. 
DEFAULT**

 



 

 **Section 8.1** ** ****_To PRIII Member s Obligations_**. If, on the
Closing Date, (i) ESS is in default of any of its material obligations
hereunder, or (ii) to the actual knowledge of PRIII Member, any of ESSs
representations or warranties are, in the aggregate, untrue, inaccurate or
incorrect, in any material respect, or (iii) the Closing otherwise fails to
occur by reason of ESSs failure or refusal to perform its material
obligations hereunder in a prompt and timely manner, and any such circumstance
described in any of _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ continues for five (5)
Business Days after written notice from PRIII Member to ESS, which written
notice shall detail such default, untruth or failure, as applicable, then
PRIII Member may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, elect to (a) terminate
this Agreement by written notice to ESS, promptly after which the Deposit
shall be paid to PRIII Member as liquidated damages and, thereafter, the
parties shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder except for
obligations which expressly survive the termination of this Agreement; or (b)
waive the condition and proceed to Closing. If this Agreement is so
terminated, then PRIII Member shall be entitled to the Deposit as liquidated
damages, and thereafter neither party to this Agreement shall have any further
rights or obligations hereunder. THE AMOUNT PAID TO AND RETAINED BY PRIII
MEMBER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PURSUANT TO THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS SHALL BE
PRIII MEMBERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IF ESS FAILS TO CLOSE THE
TRANSACTION. THE PARTIES HERETO EXPRESSLY AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PRIII
MEMBERS ACTUAL DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY ESS WOULD BE EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT
THEREON REPRESENTS THE PARTIES REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 **Section 8.2** ** ****_To ESS s Obligations_**. If, at the Closing, (i)
PRIII Member is in default of any of its material obligations hereunder, or
(ii) to the actual knowledge of ESS, any of PRIII Members Warranties are, in
the aggregate, untrue, inaccurate or incorrect in any material respect, or
(iii) the Closing otherwise fails to occur by reason of PRIII Members failure
or refusal to perform its material obligations hereunder in a prompt and
timely manner, and any such circumstance described in any of _clauses (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ or _(iii)_ continues for five (5) Business Days after written notice
from ESS to PRIII Member, which written notice shall detail such default,
untruth or failure, as applicable, then ESS shall have the right, to elect, as
its sole and exclusive remedy, to (a) terminate this Agreement by written
notice to PRIII Member, promptly after which the Deposit shall be returned to
ESS and, thereafter, the parties shall have no further rights or obligations
hereunder except for obligations which expressly

 



      
 

 



 

survive the termination of this Agreement, or (b) waive the condition and
proceed to close the Transaction, or (c) seek specific performance of this
Agreement by PRIII Member. As a condition precedent to ESS exercising any
right it may have to bring an action for specific performance hereunder, ESS
must commence such an action within sixty (60) days following the occurrence
of PRIII Members default. ESS agrees that its failure to timely commence such
an action for specific performance within such sixty (60) day period shall be
deemed a waiver by it of its right to commence an action for specific
performance as well as a waiver by it of any right it may have to file or
record a notice of _lis pendens_ or notice of pendency of action or similar
notice against all or any portion of the Properties. PRIII MEMBER ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THE INTERESTS REPRESENT INDIRECT INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY AND, AS SUCH,
ARE UNIQUE, THAT AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES FOR PRIII MEMBERS BREACH OF ITS
MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AT THE TIME OF OR PRIOR TO CLOSING
WILL NOT ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE ESS FOR THE LOSS OF THE INTERESTS AND THAT AS A
RESULT ESS WILL ONLY BE MADE WHOLE FOR SUCH A MATERIAL BREACH BY PRIII MEMBER
IF ESS IS ENTITLED TO BRING AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF PRIII
MEMBERS DUTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. For the purposes of this Section 8.2
only, "actual knowledge" of ESS as used in this Section 8.2 shall refer only
to the actual knowledge of Charley Allen, Tim Arthurs, Scott Stubbs, Mackay
Reid, David Rassmussen or Steven Tyler.

the following provisions of this Subsection (iii). If for any reason the
Closing does not occur and either party makes a written demand upon the Escrow
Agent for payment of the Escrow Deposits or the interest earned thereon, the
Escrow Agent shall give written notice to the other party of such demand. If
the Escrow Agent does not receive a written objection from the other party to
the proposed payment within ten (10) days after the giving of such

 



      
 

 



 

notice, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to make such payment. If the
Escrow Agent does receive such written objection within such period, the
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount until otherwise directed by
written instructions signed by PRIII Member and ESS or a final judgment of a
court.

 



 

(iv) The parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is acting solely as a
stakeholder at their request and for their convenience, that the Escrow Agent
shall not be deemed to be the agent of either of the parties, and that the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to either of the parties for any action or
omission on its part taken or made in good faith, and not in disregard of this
Agreement, but shall be liable for its negligent acts and for any Liabilities
(including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred by
PRIII Member or ESS resulting from the Escrow Agents mistake of law
respecting the Escrow Agents scope or nature of its duties. PRIII Member and
ESS shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless
from and against all Liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees,
expenses and disbursements) incurred in connection with the performance of the
Escrow Agents duties hereunder, except with respect to actions or omissions
taken or made by the Escrow Agent in bad faith, in disregard of this Agreement
or involving negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(v) ESS shall pay any income taxes on any interest earned on the Escrow
Deposits. ESS represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that its taxpayer
identification number is 20-2799025.

 



 

(vi) The Escrow Agent has executed this Agreement in the place indicated on
the signature page hereof in order to confirm that the Escrow Agent has
received and shall hold the Escrow Deposits and the interest earned thereon,
in escrow, and shall disburse the Escrow Deposits, and the interest earned
thereon, pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IX_.

 



 

The provisions of this Article IX shall survive the Closing (and not be merged
therein) or earlier termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X. 
MISCELLANEOUS**

EXHIBIT E

 



 

 **CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS**

 

 **BY ENTITY TRANSFEROR**

 



 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a transferee of a
United States real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor is a
foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner of a
disregarded entity (which has legal title to a U.S. real property interest
under local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the
disregarded entity. PRISA III CO-INVESTMENT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" **Seller** "), will transfer its membership interests in ESS PRISA
III LLC which owns the properties listed on _Exhibit_ A attached hereto (the
" **Properties** ") to ESS Extra Space Sixty Three, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" **Transferee** "). Seller is a disregarded entity that is
wholly-owned by PRISA III REIT Operating LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("
**Transferor** ").

 



 

1. In order to inform Transferee that withholding of tax is not required upon disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Transferor, the undersigned hereby certifies and declares by means of this certificate the following on behalf of the Transferor.

 



 

(a) The Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust or foreign estate (as these terms are defined in the Internal Revenue
Code and Income Tax Regulations).

 



 

(b) The Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in §
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Code.

 



 

(c) The Transferors employer identification number is:
.

 



 

(d) The Transferors office address is:
.

 



 

2. The Transferor understands that this certificate may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service by the Transferee and that any false statement contained in this certificate may be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 



 

 _[ **Signature On Following Page** ]_

 



      
 

 



 

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certificate
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete. I
further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of the
Transferor.
