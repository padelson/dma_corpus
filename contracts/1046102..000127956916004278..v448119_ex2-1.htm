Information to Parent that is Compliant, the Company may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when the Company believes it completed

executed Optionholder Letter of Transmittal and in exchange therefor, the
Surviving Corporation shall or shall direct its payroll agent to, in
accordance with its customary payroll practices, in exchange for such duly
executed and delivered Optionholder Letter of Transmittal, pay amounts due
with respect to each such Vested Option so surrendered, but without interest;

Share Portion of the Estimated Closing Proceeds, _plus_ the Retained Per
Share Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds, _plus_ the Retained Per
Share Portion of any portion of the Representative Holdback Amount, and the
denominator of which shall be the Closing Reference Stock Price (the " _Option
Exchange Ratio_ ") (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole share),
at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Unvested Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to

conditioned).

(d) Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to any Person with respect to Dissenting Shares in excess of
the amount that would otherwise be payable pursuant to _Section 2.02_ for
each such Dissenting Share (such amount, unless determined in a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court, being subject to the written approval of the
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and all interest, costs, expenses and fees incurred by the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the
exercise of all rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shall be entitled to
indemnification as Losses as set forth in _Article XI_  hereof as an

the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated pursuant to the terms set forth in the Certificate of
Merger (which shall include provisions related to indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses identical to those set forth in the certificate
of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the

pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation or such other Person is required to

(h) the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative
(on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders) shall make such
other deliveries as are required by _Article IV_.

  



  

3.03 _Closing Proceeds Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Parent the Company's good-faith
estimate as of the Closing Reference Time of the Closing Proceeds (the "
_Estimated Closing Proceeds_ "), including each of the components thereof,
together with a reasonably detailed computation of, and reasonable supporting
materials for, such estimates, in each case based on the Company's books and
records and other information then available. The Company shall consider in
good faith any reasonable comments to the Estimated Closing Proceeds provided
by the Parent.

  



  

(b) No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Parent's calculation of the Closing
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, together with a
reasonably detailed computation of, and reasonable supporting materials for,
the amounts set forth thereon.

  



  

(c) The Estimated Closing Proceeds and the Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Company's past
practice and _Exhibit I_.

  



  

(d) Following delivery of the Closing Statement and until the final
determination of the Closing Proceeds, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) shall (i) permit the Representative and
its representatives to have reasonable access (by electronic means to the
extent reasonably available without material additional cost or burden to
Parent), during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
books and records of the Surviving Corporation and to review the working
papers of the Parent relating to the Closing Statement and (ii) provide the
Representative and its representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to Parent's and its Subsidiaries'
(including the Surviving Corporation's) employees and advisors (including
making their chief financial officer(s) and accountants available to respond
to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative or its
representatives), provided in each case that such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Company. If the Representative disagrees
with any part of Parent's calculation of the Closing Proceeds as set forth on
the Closing Statement, the Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after
the Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement, notify Parent in
writing of such disagreement by setting forth the Representative's
calculation of the Closing Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The Closing Statement shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto (a) on the sixtieth
(60th) day after delivery of the Closing Statement to the Representative
unless Parent receives from the Representative prior to such sixtieth (60th)
day an Objection Notice, or (b) such earlier date as the
Representative notifies Parent in writing that it does not dispute the
Closing Statement. If an Objection Notice is delivered to Parent, then Parent
and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Proceeds. In the
event that Parent and the Representative are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within thirty (30) days after Parent's receipt of such
Objection Notice, Parent and the Representative shall submit such remaining
disagreements to Deloitte LLP, or if Deloitte LLP is unwilling or unable to
serve, another nationally-recognized accounting firm as is acceptable to the
Parent and the Representative (the " _Independent Firm_ ").

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The Independent Firm shall make a final and binding
determination with respect to the computation of the Closing Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof to the extent any such amounts are
in dispute, in accordance with _Exhibit I_ and the accounting principles set
forth in this Agreement. The Parent and the Representative shall cooperate
with the Independent Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Firm to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, as soon as practicable. Parent and
the Representative will each furnish to the Independent Firm such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed items and
amounts and answer questions, as the Independent Firm may reasonably request.
Neither Parent nor the Representative shall have any ex parte communications
or meetings with the Independent Firm regarding such dispute without
the prior consent of the other. The Independent Firm shall consider only
those items and amounts in the Parent's and the Representative's respective
calculations of the Closing Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to which the Parent
and the Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Independent Firm's
determination of the Closing Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Parent
and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the
definitions included herein. All such written materials submitted shall be
delivered to each party at the same time delivered to the Independent Firm.
The determination of the Independent Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further
review.

  



  

(f) The costs and expenses of the Independent Firm in determining
the Closing Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be
borne by the Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Parent
claims the Closing Proceeds are one thousand dollars ($1,000) less than the
amount determined by the Representative, and the Representative contests only
five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Parent, and if the
Independent Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Parent three
hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500) contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Independent Firm will be allocated sixty percent
(60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) and forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500)
to the Parent. Prior to the Independent Firm's determination of Closing
Proceeds, (i) the Parent, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf
of the Indemnifying Securityholders), on the other hand, shall each pay fifty
percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the Independent Firm and (ii) during the
engagement of the Independent Firm, the Independent Firm will bill fifty
percent (50%) of the total charges to each of the Parent, on the one hand, and
the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders), on the
other hand. In connection with the Independent Firm's determination of
Closing Proceeds, the Independent Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the
terms of the first and second sentences of this  _Section 3.03(f)_, and
taking into account all fees and expenses already paid by each of the Parent,
on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying
Securityholders), on the other hand, as of the date of such
determination, the allocation of its fees and expenses between the Parent and
the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders), which
such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

  



    

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of
the Closing Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, pursuant to
this _Section 3.03_:

  



  

(i) if the Closing Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 3.03_ are less than the Estimated Closing Proceeds by more than the
Purchase Price Adjustments Collar (the amount of such deficiency, the "
_Parent Adjustment Amount_ "), then the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) shall pay to the Parent an amount equal to such
deficiency first from the Representative Holdback Amount, and if the Parent
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Representative Holdback Amount, then the
Representative shall pay to the Parent the remainder of the Parent Adjustment
Amount from the Indemnification Escrow Account after exhausting the
Representative Holdback Amount; and

  



  

(ii) if the Closing Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 3.03_ are greater than the Estimated Closing Proceeds by more than
the Purchase Price Adjustments Collar (the amount of such excess, the "
_Seller Adjustment Amount_ "), then the Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the Paying
Agent (on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders) an amount equal to such
excess.

  



  

All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.03(g)_ (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustments_ ") shall not include interest on the Parent Adjustment
Amount or the Seller Adjustment Amount, as applicable. All Purchase Price
Adjustments shall (x) be treated by all parties for Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Merger Consideration to the maximum extent permitted by Law
and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Parent or the Representative, as applicable. The
payments described in this _Section 3.03(g)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying
Securityholders) for any and all Claims arising under this Agreement with
respect to this _Section 3.03_.

and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows.

  



  

5.01 _Organization and Corporate Power_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

aggregate, are not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(or its equivalent, if applicable) in every jurisdiction in which the

favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS that such
Pension Plan is so qualified or has requested such a favorable
determination letter within the remedial amendment period of Section 401(b)
of the Code and the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that

(c) With respect to the Plans, (i) all required contributions have
been made or properly accrued, (ii) there are no Claims pending or, to the
Company's knowledge, threatened, other than routine Claims for benefits, (iii)

filed with any Governmental Body or distributed to any Plan participant have
been timely filed or distributed.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, nor, to the

employees or any other "fiduciary," as such term is defined in Section 3 of
ERISA, committed any material breach of fiduciary responsibility imposed by
ERISA or any other applicable Law with respect to the Plans which would
subject the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers or employees to any material liability under ERISA or any
applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has sponsored,
maintained or contributed to a "pension plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or any "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and no circumstances exist
pursuant to which the Company or a Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to
have any material liability on or after the Closing Date with respect to such
a plan that is sponsored or contributed to by any current or former ERISA
Affiliate of the Company or a Subsidiary.

  



  

(f) None of the Welfare Plans obligates the Company or its
Subsidiaries to provide a current or former employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) any life insurance or medical or health benefits after
his or her termination of employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA or any other applicable Law.

  



  

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any other payment or benefit, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer.

exercise price per share no lower than the fair market value of one share of
Company Stock on the date of the corporate action effectuating the grant.
_Section 5.15(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Option designated
as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
which Options met all requirements for such designation, and the Company has

(k) Each Plan which is subject to any Law other than U.S. federal,
state or local Law (" _Foreign Plan_ ") has been administered in compliance
in all material respects with its terms and operated in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Laws. Each Foreign Plan required to be
registered or approved by a non-U.S. Governmental Body has been registered or
approved and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, and to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since
the date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any
such Foreign Plan that could reasonably be expected to materially affect any
such approval relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto in a
manner material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each
Foreign Plan that is a Pension Plan is fully funded or fully insured on a
termination basis to the extent required by applicable Law (determined using
reasonable actuarial assumptions).

  



  

5.16 _Insurance_.  _Section 5.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth each insurance policy maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries on
their properties, assets, products, business or personnel (the " _Insurance

or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge
of the Company, (A) Hazardous Materials are not otherwise present at or

affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries due to a violation of any
applicable Environmental Law, and (B) there is no reasonable basis for any
Environmental Claim against it or any of its Subsidiaries, or any liability or
obligation of it or any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental Laws; and

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the

_provided_ , that for purposes of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
shall also include, after the date hereof, to the extent alternative financing
from alternative financial institutions is obtained in accordance with
_Section 8.06(d)_ , any commitment letters executed by such alternative
financial institutions in respect of such alternative financing) from the

purposes of this Agreement, the Committed Financing Sources shall also
include, after the date hereof, to the extent alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions is obtained in accordance with
_Section 8.06(d)_ , any such alternative financial institution, together with
executed fee letters referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter (collectively,
the " _Debt Fee Letters_ ") (it being understood that any such fee letter
provided to the Company shall be redacted to omit the amount of fees, other
numerical amounts and "flex provisions" provided therein and any other
customarily redacted provisions provided therein (none of which would
adversely affect the amount, conditionality or availability or termination of
the Committed Financing)), pursuant to which, and subject only to the terms
and conditions expressly set forth therein, the Committed Financing Sources
have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent and/or Merger
Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Committed Financing_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Agreement, the Committed Financing shall also include, after the date
hereof, to the extent Alternative Committed Financing from alternative
financial institutions is obtained in accordance with this Agreement, any such
Alternative Committed Financing. As of the date hereof, other than the Debt
Fee Letters, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements (except for customary engagement letters in respect of the
Committed Financing and side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter) to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any manner that would affect
the amount, availability or conditionality of the Committed Financing and
(ii) no such amendment, supplement or modification that is or would reasonably
be expected to be adverse to the Company is contemplated. The Debt
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent as of the
date hereof, the other parties thereto, except as such enforceability may be
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights or to general principles of
equity. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term, or a failure of any
condition (assuming satisfaction of the conditions in _Sections 4.01_ and
_4.03_ ), of the Debt Commitment Letter, or otherwise result in the Committed
Financing being unavailable or delayed. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies relating to the funding of the full amount of the
Committed Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
 As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe
that it would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition to Closing
of the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it, nor does Parent
have knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that any of the Committed
Financing Sources will not perform the respective funding obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and conditions.
Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees that are due and payable on or before the date of this Agreement pursuant
to the Debt Commitment Letter and will have fully paid on or prior to the
Closing any and all commitment fees or other fees as they become due and
payable after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter.

  



  

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in
_Article V_ to the extent necessary to satisfy the conditions in
_Section 4.01(a)_ and _4.01(b)_ and the performance of the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement, the net proceeds of the Committed
Financing, when and if funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter,
together with Parent's cash on hand, will be, in the aggregate, sufficient to
(i) make all payments contemplated by this Agreement in connection with
the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article
II_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger) and (ii) pay all fees
and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by the Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger.

Arrangements)_ "; provided, that, with respect to any 280G Arrangements that
are entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the
applicable 280G Calculations will be provided to Parent no later than the
later of (i) the 280G Calculation Date and (ii) the seventh (7th) Business Day
following the date on which such 280G Arrangement is entered into. Prior to
the Closing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable
best efforts to seek, prior to the initiation of the equityholder approval
procedure described below in this _Section 7.06_ , from each Person to
whom any payment or benefit will or could be made that could reasonably
constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Section 280G Payments_ "), a
written agreement waiving such Person's right to receive some or all of such
payment or benefit (the " _Waived Benefits_ "), to the extent necessary so
that all remaining payments and benefits applicable to such Person shall not
be deemed a parachute payment subject to the deduction restrictions imposed
by Section 280G of the Code, and accepting in substitution for the
Waived Benefits the right to receive the Waived Benefits only if approved by
the equityholders of the Company in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder.
Prior to the Closing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval by such number of
equityholders of the Company in a manner that complies with the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder,
including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations, of the right
of each Person described in this _Section 7.06_ who has executed the waiver
described therein to receive or retain, as applicable, such Person's Waived
Benefits. The Company shall provide Parent for its reasonable review and
comment advance copies of all documents and communications by which it
intends to seek the waiver and approvals described in this _Section 7.06_ and
shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any executed waivers and
evidence of the equityholder approval contemplated by this _Section 7.06_.

documented, out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in connection with the
Company's or its Affiliates' obligations under this _Section 7.08_ , including

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i)

efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law or result in the waiver of such
privilege, including by providing such information in redacted form as

Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement will require any officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing; provided that

not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company, its Subsidiaries
and its or their respective marks, products, services, offerings or
intellectual property rights and (ii) are used solely in connection with a
description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger.

Subsidiaries and their respective Company Representatives from and
against any and all losses actually suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Financing or the performance by the Company or any
Company Representative of the provisions contained in this Agreement relating
to the Financing, including to the extent arising from any action taken by
them at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.08_ and any
information misused by the Financing Sources in connection therewith, except
to the extent resulting from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct in information provided hereunder by any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as determined in a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

  



  

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or any of its
representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.08_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that Parent and

Article VIII _ 
  
 COVENANTS OF PARENT_

  



  

8.01 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
the Company pursuant to any and all indemnification agreements between the
Company and any of its current or former directors and officers and any
Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and any indemnification provisions
under the Company Governance Documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the Persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such
provisions, and all other current and former directors and officers of
Company being referred to collectively as the " _D andO Indemnitees_"). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses covering the period before the
Effective Time that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and
during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended
or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.
Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of this
Agreement in favor of the DandO Indemnitees shall survive the Merger and
therefore shall be enforceable against the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company shall obtain a six-year "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date with respect to those persons
who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Company's directors and officers currently
covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; provided that, such "tail" policy shall provide such coverage for six
years from the Closing Date and shall be obtained from the Company's or
Parent's current insurance company or another reputable insurance company,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (such policies, the " _D andO Tail
Policies_"); _provided_ , that 100% of the premium for the DandO Tail Policies
shall be a Transaction Expense.

  



  

(c) This  _Section 8.01_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by
the DandO Indemnitees, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation. If the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
8.01_.

  



    

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.02 _Regulatory Filings_. Subject to _Section 10.02_ , the Parent
shall (a) make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under any Laws
or regulations applicable to the Parent required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, (b) coordinate and cooperate with the
Company in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
Company may reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing and
(c) (i) supply promptly any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested in connection with such filings and (ii) make any
further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable
in connection therewith.

  



  

8.03 _Payments to Optionholders and Other Individuals_. In order to
ensure compliance with applicable Tax withholding requirements, any payments
made hereunder to any Stockholder, Optionholder or other individual
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, disbursements of any portion of the
Merger Consideration), shall, at the request of the Representative or the
discretion of the Parent, be made through the payroll processing system of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

8.04 _Form S-8_. Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8, to the extent such form is available, for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to each Unvested Option assumed by Parent in the
Merger as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the
Closing Date, and shall exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any of such
Unvested Options remain outstanding.

  



  

8.05 _Employee Matters_. For the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to the employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company who
are employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries on and immediately after the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") employee benefits and regular
compensation (disregarding long-term incentive compensation) no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date. With respect to each benefit plan, program,
practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent (the " _Parent Plans_ ")
in which Continuing Employees participate following the Closing Date, for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits,
service with the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or predecessor
employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be
treated as service with Parent; provided that, such service shall not be
recognized for purpose of accruals of benefits or to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent
that such service was not recognized under the applicable Plan. Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition (or
actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plan that is a group
health plan to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted or construed to confer upon any employee
any right with respect to continuance of employment by or other service with
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, nor shall this Agreement interfere in any
way with the right of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to terminate or
change any Continuing Employee's or service provider's employment or other
association, compensation or benefits at any time, or require Parent or any
Subsidiary to continue the employment or services of any employee or service
provider following the Effective Time and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment of, or interfere in any way with, the right of
Parent or any Subsidiary to amend, terminate or otherwise discontinue any or
all plans, practices or policies of Parent or any Subsidiary in effect from
time to time.

8.06 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange
and obtain (x) the Committed Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a
whole (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto set forth in the
Debt Fee Letters), described in the Debt Commitment Letter, or (y) any other
financing (together with the Committed Financing, the " _Financing_ ") that
is in an aggregate amount sufficient, together with Parent's cash on hand, to
(I) make all payments contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the
Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_
in connection with or as a result of the Merger) as and when due and (II) pay
all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by the Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the Merger, including, if necessary, executing
and delivering all such documents and instruments as may be reasonably
required under the Debt Commitment Letter and using (and causing its
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Debt Fee Letters, negotiate and enter into a definitive
financing agreement with respect to the Committed Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "
_Financing Agreement_ ") (and comply with and maintain in effect the
Financing Agreement) so that the Financing Agreement is in effect as promptly
as practicable (taking into account the Marketing Period) but in any event no
later than the Closing;

  



  

(ii) satisfy, or cause their respective representatives to satisfy,
as promptly as practicable and on a timely (taking into account the
Marketing Period) basis all conditions to the Committed Financing that are
applicable to Parent and the Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing Agreement that are within their control (except that such obligation
shall not be breached in respect of any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a result of the Company's failure to comply with _Section 7.08_
); and

  



  

(iii) in the event that all conditions contained to the Committed
Financing and the Merger have been satisfied or waived, enforce the
funding obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and Financing Agreement
in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Financing Agreement.

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy
or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company to the extent that such
amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Committed
Financing from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter delivered
as of the date hereof (unless Parent or Merger Sub has a corresponding amount
of excess available cash on hand or net proceeds of other Financing that are
to be available to Parent or Merger Sub at the Closing such that the
representation set forth in _Section 6.09_ of this Agreement will still be
true and correct taking into account such commitment decrease, the then-
applicable cash on hand and such net proceeds of other Financing), (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Committed Financing in a manner that
would make it less likely that the Committed Financing would be funded
(including by making the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur) or otherwise prevent or delay or impair the ability or likelihood of
Parent to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreement. Parent shall not agree to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation
or rescission of any Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Company and shall not release or consent to
the termination of the obligations of the Committed Financing Sources under
the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company or
in accordance with _Section 8.06(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and
Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, documentation agents
or entities in similar roles without the prior written consent of the
Company. Upon any amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of, or
waiver of, the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement in accordance
with this _Section 8.06(b)_ , Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the
Company and references herein to "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Financing
Agreement" shall include and mean such documents as amended, supplemented,
modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section 8.06(b)_ ,
and references to "Committed Financing" shall include and mean the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement as amended,
supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section
8.06(b)_ , as applicable.

  



  

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute Financing (that is not
Committed Financing or Alternative Committed Financing) for all or
any portion of the Committed Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources so long as (i) such
substitution does not, as compared to the Committed Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Fee Letters on the date of this
Agreement, impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in each case, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent, delay or impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and
(ii) the Company shall have consented in writing to such substituted
Financing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, except as
contemplated in _Section 8.06(c)_ , in the event that any portion of the
Committed Financing becomes unavailable on the terms or conditions (including
the "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letters) or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement for any
reason or any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement shall
be withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any reason (but without
limiting the obligations of Parent in the last sentence of _Section 8.06(b)_
and in _Section 8.06(a)(iii)_ ), (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the
Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain, as promptly (taking into account the Marketing Period) as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Closing), and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to, alternative debt financing from the same or alternative debt Committed
Financing Sources (the " _Alternative Committed Financing_ ") in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or replace any unavailable portion of the Committed
Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter (including any
associated engagement letter and related Debt Fee Letters) with respect to
such Alternative Committed Financing (collectively, the " _New Debt Commitment
Letter_ "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the Company (with
only the fee amounts and market flex terms redacted from the Debt Fee
Letters in a customary manner (so long as the redaction does not cover terms
that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or termination
of the Alternative Committed Financing)); _provided_ , that Parent shall not
be required to obtain Alternative Committed Financing on terms and conditions
that are less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those in the Debt
Commitment Letter that such Alternative Committed Financing and New Debt
Commitment Letter would replace. In the event any Alternative
Committed Financing is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered
into in accordance with this _Section 8.06(d)_ , references herein to (A)
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include and mean the Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) "Committed Financing"
shall include and mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as modified pursuant to the preceding clause (A).

  



  

(e) Parent shall (i) give the Company prompt written notice of any
default, breach or threatened default or breach (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to make the likelihood that the Committed Financing (or any
Alternative Committed Financing) would be funded less likely of which Parent
or any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives becomes aware or
any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission or threatened
withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof; provided, that in
no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information
shared among Parent and its professional advisors in connection with matters
contemplated by the foregoing clause (i) that is subject to attorney-client
or similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a manner that would not waive such privilege,
and (ii) promptly upon the Company's request, otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice (A) of the receipt by Parent or delivery by Parent of
any notice or other communication, in each case with respect to (x) any
actual or potential default under or breach of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement by Parent, or any withdrawal,
termination, repudiation or rescission or threatened withdrawal,
termination, repudiation or rescission thereof by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement or (y) any dispute or
disagreement between or among parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreement with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or
the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing, and (B) if at any
time for any reason Parent believes that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreement that is required for Parent to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby or, if applicable, will be
unable to obtain Alternative Committed Financing. Parent shall promptly
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be under any
obligation to disclose any information shared among Parent and its
professional advisors in connection with matters contemplated by the
immediately preceding two sentences that is subject to attorney-client or
similar privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a manner that would not waive such privilege.

other Financing is a condition to the Closing.

conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 4.03(b)_ or _Section 4.03(c)_
shall not have been satisfied or duly waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefit of such condition but all other conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article_ _IV_  shall have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,

the End Date) or waived, then the End Date shall be automatically extended
without further action of the parties to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on
September 29, 2017; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Marketing Period has
commenced and is continuing but the Closing has not yet occurred as of the

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) by the Parent, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company or the Representative set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ shall be or have
become untrue, in either case, such that any of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ _4.01(a)_ , _4.01(b)_ or _4.01(c)_ would not be satisfied as of
the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue; _provided_ , _however_ , that, until such date as
the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section 3.01_ , if such inaccuracy of
the representation and warranties contained in _Article V_ or breach is
curable through the exercise of reasonable best efforts and for so long
as the Company or the Representative continues to exercise such reasonable
best efforts, the Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.01(e)_ (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ if Parent shall have materially breached
this Agreement or if such breach by the Company or the Representative is cured
such that such conditions would then be satisfied); or

  



  

(f) by the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on
the part of the Parent or the Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub shall be or
have become untrue, in either case, such that any of the condition set forth
in _Section_ _4.02(a)_ or _4.02(b)_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, until such date as the Closing should occur pursuant to
_Section 3.01_ , if such inaccuracy of the representation and warranties
contained in _Article VI_ or if such breach is curable by the Parent and the
Merger Sub through the exercise of reasonable best efforts and for so long as
the Parent and the Merger Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, the Representative and the Company may not terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.01(f)_ (it being understood that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(f)_ if the Company
shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by Parent or
Merger Sub is cured such that such conditions would then be satisfied).

  



  

9.02 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. If a party
hereto wishes to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , then
such party shall deliver to the other parties to this Agreement a written
notice stating that such party is terminating this Agreement and setting forth

Article X _ 
  
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS_

  



  

10.01 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and
when reasonably requested by any party hereto and at such requesting party's
expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

10.02 _Regulatory Filings; Efforts_.

  



  

(a) The Company and the Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
United States Department of Justice the notification and report form required
by the HSR Act for the Merger contemplated hereby within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the date hereof or such later date as may be agreed by the
parties and to provide any additional or supplemental information and
documentary material requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act, (ii) with respect to any other Governmental Body, promptly make any
other filings or reports, and submit any information and documentation
required for the Merger contemplated hereby, pursuant to any Other Antitrust
Regulations, (iii) subject to _Section 10.02(c)_ and _10.02(d)_ , cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or Other Antitrust Regulations, as applicable, as soon as practicable after
the date hereof, and (iv) subject to _Section 10.02(c)_ and _10.02(d)_ , avoid
any impediment to the consummation of the Merger under any applicable Laws
(including the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Regulations) which would cause the
conditions set forth in _Sections 4.03(b)_ and _4.03(c)_ not to be satisfied
as of the Closing, including using reasonably best efforts to take all such
action as may reasonably be necessary to resolve such objections (if any) as
the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Body or Person may assert under
any applicable Laws (including the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Regulations)
with respect to the Merger which would cause the conditions set forth in
_Sections 4.03(b)_ and _4.03(c)_  not to be satisfied as of the Closing. Each
of the Company and the Parent shall furnish to each other's counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Regulations. The Parent shall be
responsible for the filing fees payable in connection with the filings
described in the first sentence of this _Section 10.02_.

  



    

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Company and the Parent shall: (i) promptly notify each other
of any oral or written communication received from any Governmental Body, and
(ii) subject to applicable law, furnish the other party copies of all
correspondence, filings, applications, submissions, notifications, documents,
and communications (and memoranda setting forth substance thereof) between
them and their respective affiliates on one hand, and any Governmental Body
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, including advanced
drafts thereof and the reasonable opportunity to comment on them. Except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Body and applicable law, each party
will consult and cooperate with the other, and will consider in good faith,
the views of the other party, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust
Regulations. To the extent permitted by any such Governmental Body, each
party will permit authorized representatives of the other party to be
present at each meeting or teleconference relating to any investigation or
legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body
in connection with any such investigation or legal proceeding. Parent shall
have the sole right to devise and implement the strategy for obtaining any
necessary clearance or approval, for responding to any request, inquiry, or
investigation, for defending any lawsuit challenging the Merger, and for
leading all meetings and communications with any Governmental Body that has
authority to enforce the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Regulations; provided
however, that Parent shall consult with the Company and consider in good faith
views expressed by the Company and its advisors concerning the foregoing.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing shall require Parent to take any action that will require,
or be deemed to require, Parent or the Company to take any action described
in this _Section 10.02(c)_ that could reasonably be expected to have or
result in a "Material Adverse Impact," including but not limited to any
Material Adverse Impact that would result from (i) disposing or transferring
any asset, including those of Parent or Company; (ii) licensing or
otherwise making available to any Person, any technology or other
Intellectual Property of Parent or Company; (iii) holding separate any assets
or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of Parent or Company;
or (iv) changing or modifying any course of conduct or otherwise making any
commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding future operations
of the Parent or Company's business to obtain any approval from any
Governmental Body or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any
Governmental Body under the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Regulations or to
prevent the entry of any decree, judgment, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or any order that would otherwise make the Agreement, Merger, or
any contingent agreements unlawful. " _Material Adverse Impact_ " means any
material reduction in the value (including any reasonably anticipated economic
benefit), measured either individually or in the aggregate, of Parent, the
Company or the combined businesses, expected from any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or contingent agreements, Parent shall not be obligated to defend
any action or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Regulations, or if any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order is entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or
enforced by a court or other Governmental Body, which decree, judgment,
injunction or other order would make the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or
delay consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby, Parent is not required
to take any action to contest or resist any such action or proceeding or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any such decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger contemplated by this Agreement or to have such decree, judgment,
injunction or other order repealed, rescinded, or made inapplicable so as to
permit consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable and in any event on or prior to the End Date.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
_Section 10.02_ shall not apply to any matters relating to Taxes.

  



  

10.03 _Government Permits_. The Company will cooperate with Parent
to use reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare any amendments or take any
other necessary steps, if reasonably requested by Parent, to transfer current
Permits, including export and import licenses, agreements and other approvals
issued by a Governmental Body, to such entity as Parent may designate.

  



  

10.04 _CFIUS Approval_. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use its or their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof. Such reasonable best efforts shall include, without limitation,
promptly (and not later than 15 Business Days after the date hereof, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties) making any draft filing required
in connection with the CFIUS Approval in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800,
and promptly making any final filing in connection with the CFIUS Approval
and in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 after receipt of confirmation that
CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing, and providing any
information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S.
government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

10.05 _ITAR Notices_.

  



  

(a) If the Company is registered under or has an outstanding
application for registration under the ITAR, each of the Company and
Parent shall: (a) in the case of the Company, promptly (but in no event later
than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date) submit an ITAR 60-Day Notice;
(b) promptly provide all relevant information within their respective control
and requested by DDTC in connection with the ITAR 60-Day Notice; and (c) keep
each other generally apprised of communications with, and requests for,
additional information from such Governmental Body, and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the 60-Day Notice Condition. Subject
to applicable Law, the Company and the Parent will consult and cooperate with
one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of the Company or Parent relating to proceedings under the ITAR,
including the preparation and timely filing with DDTC of notices pursuant to
Section 122.4(a) of the ITAR, and the preparation and timely submission to
DDTC of requests to transfer or amend licenses, agreements and
other authorizations under the ITAR.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to any term or
take any action in connection with the efforts to satisfy the 60-Day Notice
Condition, whether or not requested by any Governmental Body as requirements
or conditions to mitigate any ITAR concerns or otherwise, that would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Article XI _ 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

11.01 _Indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Parties_. From
and after the Closing, each Indemnifying Securityholder, severally and not
jointly, based on their respective Indemnity Allocation Percentages, shall
indemnify the Parent and each of its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees or agents (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
(subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this _Article XI_  and
the Escrow Agreement) against, and hold them harmless from (a) the matters set
forth in _Section 11.01_ of the Disclosure Schedule and (b) any and all out-
of-pocket loss, liability, damage, Tax or expense (including reasonable legal
fees) suffered or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnified Parties
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") to the extent resulting from any breach by the
Company of any of the Fundamental Representations (without giving effect to
any materiality or similar qualification limiting the scope of such
representation or warranty solely for the purpose of determining the amount of
any such loss, liability, damage, Tax or expense) or from fraud committed by
or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and, in each case, to the extent such Losses
are determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction or in a
written agreement of Parent and the Representative; _provided_ , that, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under this
_Section 11.01_ until the total amount which the Parent Indemnified Parties
would otherwise recover under this _Section 11.01_ exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent of any such excess; and the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under this
_Section 11.01_ or otherwise an aggregate amount in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Deductible and Cap shall not apply in the case of Losses resulting from
fraud committed by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, "fraud" shall mean as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, an actual, intentional and knowing common law fraud
(and not a constructive fraud or negligent misrepresentation or omission)
and, with respect to fraud committed by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
fraud shall mean statements of the Company Representatives that are (i) known
by them to be false, made with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity
thereof or without reasonable grounds for belief and (ii) made by them with an
intent that Parent rely thereon.

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

11.02 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the
Parent Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy against the
Indemnifying Securityholders with respect to any and all Losses or Claims
resulting from this Agreement or any right or obligation under this Agreement,
including as to this Agreement's existence, enforceability, validity,
interpretation, performance, breach or damages, including claims in tort
(other than any Losses or Claims resulting from fraud committed by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), shall be pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 3.03(g)_ , this _Article XI_ , _Section 12.14_ , the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement, and the terms and conditions of each Stockholder Letter
of Transmittal, Optionholder Letter of Transmittal and Warrant Holder Consent
Agreement. Except for the Parent pursuant to _Section 3.02(e)_, no
Person shall have any obligation to fund the Indemnification Escrow Account.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: (a) Claims by a Parent
Indemnified Party for Losses due to fraud committed by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the Escrow Account, but only after
(1) satisfying all other pending claims that are not claims for fraud
committed by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (2) making appropriate reserves
as provided in the Escrow Agreement for any unresolved claim, and (ii)
second, if the Escrow Account is insufficient after such satisfaction or
reserve, at the election of the Parent Indemnified Party, directly from each
Indemnifying Securityholder, severally in accordance with such
Indemnifying Securityholder's Indemnity Allocation Percentage of the Losses
and not jointly, up to (and not in excess of) the aggregate Merger
Consideration received by such Indemnifying Securityholder hereunder; and (b)
no Indemnifying Stockholder shall be liable for fraud committed by any Person
(including any Person or Company Representative acting on behalf of the
Company), other than fraud committed by the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such
Indemnifying Stockholder aided, abetted, committed, knowingly facilitated or
otherwise participated in such fraud.

  



  

11.03 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
11.01_ shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 11.05_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which a Parent Indemnified Party shall have, prior
to the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a Claim by
delivering a written notice to the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders).

  



  

11.04 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) In the event of a Claim or demand made by any non-Affiliated
Person against a Parent Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such
Parent Indemnified Party shall notify the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders, Vested Optionholders and Warrant Holders (the " _Indemnifying
Securityholders_ ")) in writing of the Third-Party Claim promptly (and in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days) following receipt by such
Parent Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Securityholders shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Parent Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Representative promptly after the Parent Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Parent Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against a Parent Indemnified
Party in an amount which is less than the amount of Indemnification
Escrow Funds then available, the Representative shall be entitled to, at the
Indemnifying Securityholders' expense, participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Representative and reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative may not assume and
conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim if (i) a material part of such
Third-Party Claim seeks equitable relief (other than equitable Claims that
are ancillary to a Claim for monetary damages) or if (ii) such Third-Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Claim, indictment,
allegation or investigation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, by a Governmental Body.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall continue to be
entitled to assert any limitation on any Claims made by any Parent Indemnified
Party contained in _Sections 11.01_ and  _11.02_. Should the Representative
so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Representative
shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof. If the Representative assumes such defense, the Parent
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Representative, it being understood, however, that the Representative
shall control such defense. The Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Parent Indemnified Party for any period during which
the Representative has not assumed the defense thereof, if and only if it is
ultimately determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out of, resulted
from, related to or was in connection with a matter listed in _Sections 11.01_
and _11.02_. If the Representative chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim,
all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Representative's request) the provision to the Representative of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Representative shall
control the defense of any Third-Party Claim then the Representative shall be
entitled to settle such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that, the
Representative shall obtain the prior written consent of the Parent
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a Claim or
ceasing to defend such Claim if (i) pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed
against the Parent Indemnified Party, (ii) such settlement does not expressly
and unconditionally release the Parent Indemnified Party from all liabilities
and obligations with respect to such Claim, without prejudice or (iii) such
settlement is in an amount which is greater than the amount of Indemnification
Escrow Funds then available. Whether or not the Representative shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no Parent Indemnified Party shall
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any
Third-Party Claim for which any sums are recoverable from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds pursuant to _Section 11.01 _without the prior
written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



    

 | 80| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party determines that it
may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_  for an item
or matter that is not the subject of a Third-Party Claim, the Parent
Indemnified Party shall, promptly upon its discovery of such item or matter
(and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following such discovery),
notify the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders) in
writing of such Claim. Such notification shall (i) state that the
Parent Indemnified Party has paid or incurred Losses for which such Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
XI_ and (b) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included
in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or incurred and the
nature of the breach or Claim to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Parent Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled hereunder. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate
and assist the Representative and the Indemnifying Securityholders in
determining the validity of any Claim for indemnity by the Parent Indemnified
Party and in otherwise resolving such matters, such assistance and cooperation
to include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records
and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

  



  

11.05 _Survival_. The Fundamental Representations herein shall
survive the Effective Time for purposes of the indemnification provisions set
forth herein and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the date that
is nine (9) months after the Closing Date and no Claims pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise may be brought hereunder with respect to such
Fundamental Representations thereafter;  _provided_ that, for the avoidance
of doubt, if any claim for indemnification has been asserted prior to 5:00
p.m., Pacific time, on the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing
Date, such claim shall survive and continue in effect until final resolution
of such claim. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, none
of the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time and no Claims may be brought hereunder and no Losses may be
recovered with respect to such representations and warranties. All covenants
contained in this Agreement which are to be performed prior to the Effective
Time shall terminate as of the Effective Time and no Claims may be brought
hereunder and no Losses may be recovered for any breach thereof prior to the
Effective Time. The covenants contained in this Agreement which are to be
performed at or after the Closing shall terminate once such covenants are
fully performed; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Indemnifying Securityholders shall have any obligation or liability therefor.
Except for any Claims resulting from fraud committed by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (it being agreed that any such Claims shall terminate and may not be
brought after 5:00 p.m., Pacific time on the date that is five (5) years after
the Closing Date), no Claim for indemnification hereunder and no Losses may
be recovered for breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and other provisions may be made after the expiration
of the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 11.05_. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that
the foregoing respective survival periods and termination dates supersede any
applicable statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to such
representations, warranties and covenants and the right to make
indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement.

11.06 _Manner of and Limitations on Payment_. Subject to, and
in accordance with, the provisions of this _Article XI_ , any indemnification
of the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be
delivered to the Parent from the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Parent within ten (10) days
after the determination thereof in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Funds
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for a Parent Indemnified Party to
recover its Losses with respect to Losses claimed under _Section 11.01_ as a
result of breaches by the Company of any Fundamental Representations. No
Claim may be made against, and no Losses may be recovered from, any
Indemnifying Securityholder unless and until the Indemnification Escrow Funds

12.13 _Representative_. Effective upon approving this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby or by executing and delivering a
Stockholder Written Consent, Stockholder Letter of Transmittal, Optionholder
Letter of Transmittal or Warrant Holder Consent Agreement, each Stockholder
(other than Stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights for Dissenting
Shares), Vested Optionholder and Warrant Holder will, as a specific term of
the Merger, be deemed to have agreed that:

  



  

(a) The Representative is irrevocably constituted and appointed as
the representative, exclusive agent, proxy, and attorney in fact (coupled
with an interest) for all such Persons for all purposes under this Agreement
including the full power and authority on such Person's behalf: (i) to
consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith, (ii) to negotiate Claims and disputes arising under, or
relating to, this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments,
and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment of Closing Proceeds
contemplated by _Section 3.03_ and Claims for indemnification under _Article
XI_ ), (iii) to cause to be received or disbursed to, any Indemnifying
Securityholder any funds received on behalf of such Indemnifying
Securityholder under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any portion of the Merger Consideration) or otherwise, (iv) to direct
withholding of any amounts to be received by any Indemnifying Securityholder
pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
portion of the Merger Consideration) or to satisfy (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) any and all obligations or liabilities of any
Indemnifying Securityholder or the Representative in the performance of any of
their commitments hereunder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
satisfaction of payment obligations (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) in connection with the adjustment of Closing
Proceeds contemplated by _Section 3.03_ or the indemnification of the Parent
Indemnified Parties under _Article XI_ ), (v) to execute and deliver any
amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments,
and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (without
the prior approval of any Indemnifying Securityholder) and (vi) to take, or
refrain from taking, all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Securityholder or as deemed necessary by the Representative in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in
connection herewith. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative
and shall survive the Merger and the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of each Indemnifying Securityholder and shall be
binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Indemnifying Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of
his, her or its interest in the Indemnification Escrow Funds. All decisions
and actions by the Representative or omitted to be taken by the Representative
shall be binding upon each Indemnifying Securityholder and such Indemnifying
Securityholder's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by such Indemnifying Securityholder, and no Indemnifying Securityholder shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same,
except for decisions, actions or omissions of the Representative constituting
willful misconduct. The Representative shall have no duties or obligations
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, including any fiduciary duties,
except those set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and such duties
and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there
are no obligations of the Representative in any ancillary agreement,
schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule;

(b) Certain Indemnifying Securityholders have entered into an
engagement agreement with the Representative to provide direction to the
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement and the
Representative engagement agreement (such Indemnifying
Securityholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
" _Representative Group_ "), shall be liable to any Indemnifying
Securityholder for any act done or omitted hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement or under the Representative engagement agreement as the
Representative Group while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative
Group shall be indemnified, defended, held harmless and reimbursed by each
Indemnifying Securityholder severally (based on each Indemnifying
Securityholder's Indemnity Allocation Percentage), and not jointly, against
all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, fees, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of other skilled professional and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines and amounts
paid or incurred by the Representative Group in connection with any Claim,
action, suit or proceeding to which the Representative Group is made a party
by reason of the fact that such Person is or was acting as the Representative
Group pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the satisfaction of payment obligations on behalf of
the Indemnifying Securityholder) (collectively, the " _Representative
Expenses_ "). Any and all amounts paid or incurred by the Representative
Group in connection with any Claim, action, suit or proceeding to which the
Representative Group or such other Person is made a party by reason of the
fact that it is or was acting as the Representative Group pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement are on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders
(and, not for the avoidance, on behalf of the Representative in any other
capacity, as a Stockholder or otherwise);

  



  

(c) The Representative Group shall not incur any liability to any
Indemnifying Securityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of
the Representative Group for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of their duties hereunder.
The Representative Group shall have no liability in respect of any action,
Claim or proceeding brought against any such Person by any Indemnifying
Securityholder, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, if any such Person took or
omitted taking any action in good faith;

  



    

 | 91| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Representative represents and warrants that it is a limited
liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of Delaware, and it has the requisite limited liability company
power and authority, and has taken all limited liability company action
necessary or required, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform
its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Representative and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Representative, subject to the Laws of agency;

  



  

(e) The Representative may resign upon thirty (30) day notice in the
event of circumstances rendering it impracticable for the Representative to
continue to effectively serve, including amendments increasing
Representative's responsibilities without its consent or failure to pay
amounts due to Representative. The immunities and rights to indemnification
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Representative or any member
of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The rights and obligations of the Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, and the grant of authority to such
Representative set forth in this _Section 12.13_ may be assigned from time to
time or a vacancy in such position may be filled upon written consent of the
Indemnifying Securityholders receiving a majority-in-interest of the Merger
Consideration received in the aggregate by the Indemnifying Securityholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall be effective unless and
until (i) evidence of the consent referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence is provided to Parent and (ii) the assignee of such rights and
obligations becomes a party to this Agreement by executing a joinder in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent. Upon any such assignment, the Person
accepting and assuming the rights and obligations of the Representative shall
become, for all purposes, the Representative hereunder;

  



  

(f) If the Representative incurs or pays or causes to be paid, any
Representative Expenses (on behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders) in
connection with any obligation or liability of the Representative or of an
Indemnifying Securityholder in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchase Price Adjustments
or the indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Parties under _Article XI_
), any such Representative Expenses incurred may be reimbursed, first, when
and as incurred, from the Representative Holdback Amount, second, and, if not
so reimbursed from the Representative Holdback Amount, then the
Representative shall be reimbursed from any distribution of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying
Securityholders at the time of distribution, and third, the Representative
shall be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed directly by each
Indemnifying Securityholder severally (based on each Indemnifying
Securityholder's Indemnity Allocation Percentage), and not jointly, for such
amount(s)). The Indemnifying Securityholders acknowledge that the
Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Furthermore, the Representative shall not be required to take any action
unless the Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Representative in performing such actions.

  



    

 | 92| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) The Representative Holdback Amount shall be held by the
Representative in a segregated client account and shall be used (i) for
the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Representative for any
Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any Representative letter agreement, or (ii) as otherwise
determined by the Advisory Group. The Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Holdback Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Representative Holdback Amount, and
has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Indemnifying
Securityholders will not receive any interest on the Representative Holdback
Amount and assign to the Representative any such interest. Subject to Advisory
Group approval, the Representative may contribute funds to the Representative
Holdback Amount from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Indemnifying Securityholders. Following the resolution of all Claims and the
termination of the Representative's duties and obligations hereunder,
under the Escrow agreement and under the Representative engagement agreement,
and upon full reimbursement of all Representative Expenses incurred by the
Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement or under the Representative engagement agreement, the
Representative shall distribute, or caused to be distributed, all remaining
funds in the Representative Holdback Amount held by it on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders to Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Indemnifying Securityholders;

  



  

(h) The Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Final
Securityholder Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying Securityholder or other
party; and

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Representative Group and its Affiliates shall not be liable for any loss to
any Indemnifying Securityholder for any action taken or not taken by the
Representative Group or for any act or omission taken or not taken in
reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or decisions, communications or
writings made, given or executed by the Parent or the Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

12.14 _Sources of Recovery_.

  



  

(a) The Parent and the Merger Sub hereby agree and acknowledge that
its right to any payment to be made pursuant to _Article XI_ (together with
the Parent's rights under the Escrow Agreement) shall be the Parent
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts
owing to the Parent pursuant to _Article XI_.

  



  

(b) The Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that right to any
payment to be made pursuant to _Section 3.03(g)(i)_ shall be the Parent's
sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to the Parent
pursuant to _Section 3.03(g)(i)_.

  



    

 | 93| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying
Securityholders) hereby agrees and acknowledges that right to any payment to
be made pursuant to _Section 3.03(g)(ii)_ shall be the Representative's (on
behalf of the Indemnifying Securityholders) sole and exclusive source of
recovery for any amounts owing to the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Securityholders) pursuant to _Section 3.03(g)(ii)_.

  



  

12.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed
that each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any other party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any
party seeking an injunction or Order of specific performance shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any
such remedy shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

12.16 _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute the parties hereto as joint
venturers, alter egos, partners or participants in an unincorporated business
or other separate entity, nor in any manner create any principal-agent,
fiduciary or other special relationship between the parties hereto. No party
shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties) towards any other party
hereto except as specifically set forth herein.

12.17 _Protected Communications and Associated
Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
exhibits and schedules hereto and the other related agreements, the parties
hereto intend that all communications at or prior to the Closing between the
Company and the Stockholders (collectively, the " _Company Group_ ") or any
of them, on the one hand, and any of their attorneys, on the other hand,
specifically relating to the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, but subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 12.17_ , the " _Protected Communication_ "), and all associated
rights to assert, waive and otherwise administer the attorney-client
privilege and right of confidentiality of any member of the Company Group with
respect to the Protected Communication (the " _Associated Rights_ "), shall,
from and after the Closing, rest exclusively with the Stockholders and the
Representative (in its capacity as such) and shall not be transferred,
assigned, conveyed or delivered, by operation of law or otherwise, to Parent,
Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or any successor or assign
of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Parties Group_ ").
Accordingly, the parties hereby agree that, as of immediately prior to the
Closing, for the consideration set forth in this Agreement and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged: (i) all Protected Communication and Associated Rights are,
and shall be deemed for all purposes, transferred, assigned, conveyed and
delivered in full to the Stockholders, jointly and severally, and (ii) no
member of the Parent Parties Group shall have any right, title, interest or
benefit in or to any of the Protected Communication or any Associated Rights.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties acknowledge the decision of the
Delaware Chancery Court in _Great Hill Equity Partners IV, LP, et al v. SIG
Growth Equity Fund, I, LLP, et al_ (Civil Action No. 7905-CS,
Chancellor Strine, November 15, 2013) and desire to expressly exclude the
Protected Communication and Associated Rights from the assets, rights,
privileges and benefits of the Company that might otherwise be transferred or
assigned to any member of the Parent Parties Group by operation of law or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties expressly agree that the
Protected Communications and Associated Rights shall not include any
communications at or prior to the Closing between the Company Group or any of
them, on the one hand, and any of their attorneys, on the other hand: (a)
relating to: (i) the pre-Closing operation by the Company of its business
other than the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
or (ii) fraud committed by or on behalf of the Company; or (b) with respect
to which the attorney-client privilege could not validly be asserted by the
Company prior to the Closing. From and after the Closing, (a) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert any Protected Communications
against the Company Group in connection with any Claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Article XI_ brought by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Agreement and (b) neither the Stockholders nor the Representative
shall transfer, assign, convey or deliver to any other Person any right,
title, interest or benefit in or to any of the Protected Communication or any
Associated Rights.
