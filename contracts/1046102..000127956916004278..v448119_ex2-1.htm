Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a paying agent (the &ldquo;<U>Paying Agent</U>&rdquo;) for the purpose of effecting
the exchange of cash for Certificates which are converted into the right to receive payment pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.02</U>.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Paying Agent (or if agreed by the Company, the Company) will send to the holders of Company Stock,
the Stockholder Letter of Transmittal. At or after the Effective Time, each Stockholder shall surrender to the Paying Agent Certificates,
duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, together with a duly executed Stockholder Letter of Transmittal,
representing (i) the number of shares of Company Stock held by such holder or (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock represented
by the Certificates held by such holder which formerly represented shares of stock of IronPlanet, Inc.. On the Closing Date or,
with respect to any Certificates that have not been surrendered to the Paying Agent on the Closing Date, within two (2) Business

he, she or it would otherwise have been entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any shares of Company Stock are held by a
Stockholder in book entry form (&ldquo;<U>Uncertificated Stock</U>&rdquo;), the surrender of physical Certificates by the Stockholder
shall not be required by the Paying Agent in order to receive the consideration to which he, she or it is entitled under <U>Section&nbsp;2.02</U>.
At Closing, the Uncertificated Stock will automatically be converted into the right to payment pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.02
</U>and shall forthwith be canceled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the providing of an indemnity by such Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and the Representative,
against any Claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Stockholders&rsquo; Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the share(s)
of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, in the amounts, at the times, and in the manner contemplated by this <U>Article

interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity interest in, any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other Person. Except for the Company&rsquo;s interests in such Subsidiaries or as
otherwise set forth in <U>Section 5.02</U> of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, of record and
beneficially, all capital stock and other equity interests in each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens (other than
pledges to lenders in respect of Indebtedness to be repaid at Closing and Permitted Liens, if applicable), and all such capital
stock and other equity interests are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (to the extent such concept is applicable to
such equity interests). There are no outstanding options, warrants, rights, commitments, preemptive rights or agreements of any
kind to which the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound which would obligate
any of them to issue, deliver, purchase or sell any additional shares of capital stock, units, membership, or other equity or
profit interests of any kind in any of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Each of the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiaries is duly formed
or organized, validly existing and in good standing (or its equivalent, if applicable) under the applicable Laws of its jurisdiction
of formation or organization, and each of the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to own and operate
its properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing would reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiaries is
qualified to do business in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the conduct of business as now conducted
requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has made available to the Parent prior to the date hereof a true and complete
copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of each of its Subsidiaries (or such other organizational or governing documents
as may be applicable), each as amended to date (together, the &ldquo;<U>Subsidiary Governance Documents</U>&rdquo;), and each
such instrument is in full force and effect. None of the Company&rsquo;s Subsidiaries is in violation of the provisions of its
