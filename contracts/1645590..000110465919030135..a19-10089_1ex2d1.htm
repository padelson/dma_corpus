good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties
agree as follows:

 



 

 _Article I_

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the WBCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 



 

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted)
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at or immediately
prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted) waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date or
place is agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 



 

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties shall
file articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in such form as is
required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the WBCA, and shall make all other filings and recordings
required under the WBCA to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective on such date and time as the Articles of Merger are filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Washington or at such other date and time
as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger.
The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein
as the " _Effective Time_ ".

 



 

Section 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the WBCA. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of

 



     

 

 



 

the Company and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities,
debts and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation
Articles of Incorporation_ "), except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Cray Inc." and subject to _Section 6.06_, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Bylaws_ "), except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Cray Inc." and subject to _Section 6.06_, until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.06. _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, each of the Parties
shall take all necessary action to ensure that the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the
Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to
execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a member
of the Company Board to be effective as of the Effective Time (and, if and to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent at least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, will also use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain letters
of resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, from any directors of any
Subsidiary).

 



 

Section 1.07. _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.

 



 

Section 1.08. _Taking of Necessary Action_. If at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the board
of directors of the Surviving Corporation and

 



     

 

 



 

officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary
action, consistent with this Agreement, on behalf of the Company, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 _Article II_

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 



 

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any other capital
stock of the Company, or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) __Capital Stock of Merger Sub_._ Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) __Cancellation of Cancelled Shares; Conversion of Converted Shares__. Each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is at such time owned (i) by the Company as treasury stock
or (ii) by Parent or Merger Sub, in each case shall be automatically cancelled
and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (other than Merger Sub) (the " _Converted Shares_ ") will automatically
be converted into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage
of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) __Conversion of Company Common Stock__. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i)
the Cancelled Shares or the Converted Shares in accordance with _Section
2.01(b)_, (ii) the Company Restricted Shares and (iii) except as provided in
_Section 2.01(d)_, the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive $35.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (each such certificate, a " _Certificate_ "),
and/or each holder of Book-Entry Shares, that, in either case, immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) __Dissenting Shares__. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective

 



     

 

 



 

Time that are held by any holder who did not vote in favor of this Agreement
or the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who exercises dissenters
rights when and in the manner required under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_,
but instead such holder shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted
with respect to the payment of the fair value of such shares under the
applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. At the Effective Time,
the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided for pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose any such right under Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA,
then such right of such holder under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA shall cease
and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to convert (or have been converted)
at the Effective Time into, and shall become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written notices (or of any
threats with respect thereto) that the Company receives from or on behalf of
its shareholders to exercise dissenters rights in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other
instruments served pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and received by the
Company relating to shareholders dissenters rights, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for fair value under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand. Any Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock for which dissenters rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Exchange Fund and Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) __Paying Agent__. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Prior to, at or immediately after the Closing (but in any event no
later than the Closing Date), Parent, on behalf of Merger Sub, shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Subject to _Section 2.02(g)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) __Certificate Exchange Procedures__. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal

 



     

 

 



 

(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable for each such share of Company Common Stock
covered by such Certificates. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.02(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article II_. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

(c) __Book-Entry Shares__. With respect to uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and each
holder of Book-Entry Shares to ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to
such holder or its nominees, upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares held of
record by such holder or its nominees in accordance with customary surrender
procedures (including receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form and/or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), the Merger Consideration for each such Book-
Entry Share pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and each such Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to any Book-Entry Share shall only be made
to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Share is registered.

 



 

(d) __No Further Transfers of or Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock__.
All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or cancellation of Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as the case may be. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation for transfer, it shall be cancelled against delivery of the
applicable Merger Consideration to the holder thereof as provided in this
_Article II_.

 



 

(e) __Termination of the Exchange Fund__. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for (subject to applicable state, federal or other
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), payment of their claims for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) __No Liability__. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the applicable Merger Consideration would escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such
time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) __Investment of Exchange Fund__. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.

 



 

(h) __Lost Certificates__. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) __Treatment of Company Stock Options__.

 



 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, (A) each then-outstanding Company
Stock Option that is vested and is not an Underwater Option (each, a " _Cash-
Out Option_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such Cash-Out Option multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
of such Cash-Out Option, without any interest thereon, and subject to all
applicable Tax

 



     

 

 



 

withholdings. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set forth in
this _Section 2.03(a)(i)_ within five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Stock
Option that is not a Cash-Out Option or an Underwater Option (each, a " _Roll-
Over Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an
option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire (A) that number of whole
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common
Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Roll-Over Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, (B) at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
of such Roll-Over Option by (2) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 2.03(a)(ii)_, each such Parent Stock
Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Roll-Over Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including all applicable vesting acceleration
provisions).

 



 

(iii) All Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, that are
outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time with an exercise price
per share that equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration (each, an "
_Underwater Option_ ") will not be assumed by Parent and shall automatically
be cancelled and terminated without consideration upon the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) __Treatment of Company RSU Awards__.

 



 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is then-
outstanding and vested shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such vested Company RSU Award multiplied by (2) the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and subject to all applicable Tax
withholdings. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts set forth in
this _Section 2.03(b)(i)_ within five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is then-
outstanding and unvested shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted
into a restricted stock unit award that corresponds to shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, a " _Parent RSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of clause (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying a performance-vesting Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall equal 50% of the number of shares covered by the Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the remainder of such
covered shares shall be forfeited. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 2.03(b)_, each Parent RSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be

 



     

 

 



 

subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all
applicable vesting acceleration provisions), provided that any such Parent RSU
Award corresponding to a performance-vesting Company RSU Award shall no longer
be subject to performance-based vesting and shall be subject only to continued
service through the one-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs.

 



 

(c) __Treatment of Company RSA Awards_. _Effective as of the Effective Time,
each Company RSA Award that is then-outstanding and unvested and that is held
by a non-employee director of the Company shall vest, be cancelled and be
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then underlying such Company RSA Award multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and subject to all
applicable Tax withholdings. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the amounts
set forth in this _Section 2.03(c)_ within five (5) Business Days following
the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) __Resolutions__. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.03_.

 



 

(e) __Parent Actions__. At the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume all the
obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding
Parent Stock Option and Parent RSU, and the agreements evidencing the grants
thereof, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each
Company Stock Plan shall be adjusted to reflect shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Company Stock Plan. Parent
shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
no more than five Business Days) after the Effective Time, a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), to the extent such form is
available, relating to the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the
Parent Stock Options and Parent RSU Awards. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or statements for so long as Parent Stock Options and Parent RSU
Awards remain outstanding.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 2.04. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts (a) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and (b) shall be paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent within the time and in the manner required by
applicable Law.

The Company has the sole and exclusive right to bring a claim or suit (and to
recover any damages, royalties, costs or other recoverable amounts) against
any other person for past, present or future infringement of any Owned Company
Intellectual Property.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has a valid, legal and
enforceable right to use or practice under all Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the Company under the Third Party
Intellectual Property Licenses. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Owned
Company Intellectual Property together with any Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Third Party Intellectual Property Licenses constitute
all of the material Intellectual Property and material Intellectual Property
Rights necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

 



 

(g) Prior to or as of the date hereof, the Company has not granted to any
person (including any to Governmental Authority pursuant to a Company
Government Contract or Company Government Subcontract as required by Law,
regulation or contract), under any Owned Company Intellectual Property, (i)
any exclusive license or rights, or (ii) any express, formal covenant not to
assert or enforce any Owned Company Intellectual Property (other than rights
granted to customers, distributors, resellers, sales agents, marketing agents,
contractors, manufacturers, logistics contractors, and product support
contractors in the Ordinary Course of Business) or (iii) non-exclusive license
or rights that materially deviate in scope from the licenses granted by the
Company in the Ordinary Course of Business. No Owned Company Intellectual
Property that is exclusively licensed to any person is used in or necessary
for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted. The Company has not assigned any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights used in or necessary for the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

 



 

(h) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps in
accordance with standard industry practices to protect its rights in its Owned
Company Intellectual Property and maintain the confidentiality of all Trade
Secrets and other confidential information of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with respect to which the Company or its Subsidiaries owes an obligation of
confidentiality to a third party, including the use of industry-standard tools
designed to safeguard any such information that is accessible through computer
systems or networks. The Company has not received any written notice from any
person that there has been an unauthorized use or disclosure of any Trade
Secret of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring all
employees, as well as all consultants and contractors who participate in the
development of any Intellectual Property or who have access to Trade Secrets,
to execute a confidentiality and assignment agreement in the Companys
standard form, which form has been made available to Parent. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have enforced such policy, except where for any failures to
enforce that, individually or in the aggregate, have not been and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No employees, consultants
or contractors of the Company or

 



     

 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries have retained any rights to any material Intellectual
Property or material Intellectual Property Rights that would have constituted
Owned Company Intellectual Property under any such agreements absent such
retention of rights and no claims with respect to retention of rights have
been made. To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee, consultant or
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of any such
agreement in any material respect.

 



 

(i) The Companys and its Subsidiaries development, sale, advertising,
marketing, distribution or other commercial exploitation of the Company
Products, and all of the other activities or operations of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, have not and do not infringe upon
(directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise), misappropriate, dilute
(solely with respect to Marks) or violate, any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party except as has not had, and
would not have, a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2016, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any
Action asserting that such infringement, misappropriation or violation has
occurred. Since January 1, 2016, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written request or invitation to take a license
under any Patents owned by a third party.

 



 

(j) Since January 1, 2016, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
claimed or brought any Action, or provided any notice claiming any third party
has misappropriated, infringed, diluted (solely with respect to trademarks) or
violated any Owned Company Intellectual Property or other Intellectual
Property Rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights exclusively licensed to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
has any third party committed any such misappropriation, infringement,
dilution or violation that could form the basis of such an Action or notice
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(k) No Owned Company Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding
Judgment restricting or limiting in any material respect the use or practice,
right to use or practice, licensing or other exploitation thereof by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(l) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement,
including the consummation of the Merger, will not, with respect to any
Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to any other Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (i) result in Parent
or any of its Affiliates granting, or being obligated to grant, to any third
party any rights (including expanded rights) with respect to Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights, except for such obligations
applicable to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under Owned
Company Intellectual Property resulting from Contracts to which the Company or
its Subsidiaries are a party immediately prior to the Closing Date and which
apply only to the same extent as currently applicable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) result in the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
being obligated to pay any royalties or other payments to any third party at a
rate in excess of that which is payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries
had the Merger not occurred.

 



     

 

 



 

(m) The Company has made available to Parent lists of all Open Source
Materials that comprise, are incorporated into, or combined, distributed or
made available for download with any Company Products that are (i) distributed
or made available over a network to third parties, and (ii) commercially
available as of the date hereof, in each case, as generated by the scanning
and reporting tool used by the Company or otherwise made available through the
Companys responses to Parents diligence requests.

 



 

(n) During the four (4) years prior to the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or complaint that
it has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of any license to any
Open Source Materials. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or has breached any of the
material terms or conditions of any material license to any Open Source
Materials in any material respect. The Company has not used, incorporated,
combined or distributed any Open Source Materials with any Software of the
Company Products that the Company intends to keep proprietary in a manner that
requires that such Software for such Company Products be (i) disclosed or
distributed or otherwise made available in source code form, (ii) licensed for
the purpose of making derivative works, (iii) redistributable at no charge or
minimal charge or (iv) licensed under the same license as such Open Source
Materials.

 



 

(o) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a member of or party to
any patent pool, standards-setting organizations, multi-party special interest
industry standards body, trade association or other organization pursuant to
the rules of which it is obligated to license any existing or future
Copyrights or Patents to any person or to refrain from asserting any existing
or future Copyrights or Patents against any person.

 



 

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has intentionally included
in the Company Products any disabling mechanisms or protection features that
are designed to disrupt, disable, harm or otherwise impede in any material
respect the normal and authorized operation of, or provide unauthorized access
to, a computer system or network or other device on which Company Products are
stored or installed or damage or destroy any normal and authorized data or
file without the users consent.

 



 

(q) The Company and its Subsidiaries implement policies and procedures
materially consistent with generally accepted industry standards to identify
and protect against viruses, worms, and other malicious Software routines
adversely affecting the information technology systems used in connection with
the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses. The Company and its Subsidiaries have disaster recovery and
business continuity plans, procedures and facilities materially consistent
with generally accepted industry standards for the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2015,
there have been no unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the security of such
information technology systems.

 



 

(r) Prior to or as of the date hereof, no source code of any Software used in
any Company Product has been disclosed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any person (including to any Governmental Authority pursuant
to a Company Government Contract or Company Government Subcontract as required
by Law, regulation or contract), except (i) for

 



     

 

 



 

disclosure to employees or individual independent contractors of the Company
or such Subsidiaries on a need-to-know basis and who are bound by
confidentiality agreements with respect to such disclosure or (ii) to escrow
agents under source code escrow agreements with such escrow agents that
include reasonable non-disclosure provisions. Section 3.16(r) of the Company
Disclosure Letter includes a true and complete list of all such escrow
agreements and arrangements and the Company has made available to Parent all
such agreements. No condition has occurred that would be sufficient to entitle
the beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which the
Company or any Subsidiary has deposited any such source code for Company
Products to require release of such source code from escrow. The consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not
constitute a source code escrow release condition to require release of such
source code for Company Products from escrow.

 



 

(s) No Governmental Authority nor any university, college or other academic
institution has ownership rights or any ownership interest in or to any Owned
Company Intellectual Property.

 



 

(t) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed or made
available, or agreed to distribute or make available (including by
contribution to an open source project or community), any material Software
developed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as Open Source Materials
that the Company intends to remain proprietary.

 



 

(u) Each Company Product has been designed, developed, manufactured,
assembled, sold, installed, repaired, licensed and otherwise made available by

of the Company, threatened in writing to assert any material claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) under or based upon any contractual
obligation or warranty provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) under or based upon any other warranty relating to any
Company Product, except for such assertions that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(w) The Company has no Knowledge of any defects in the Company Products that
would have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has disclosed in writing to
Parent all material information relating to any problem or issue with respect
to any Company Product that materially and adversely affects, or is reasonably
expected to materially and adversely affect, the value, functionality or
fitness for the intended purpose of such Company Product. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (A) there have been and are no defects,

and are, no claims asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

by valid and currently effective insurance policies issued in favor of the
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries that are customary and adequate for
companies of similar size in the industries and locations in which the Company
operates, except where the failure to have such policies would not be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company has made
available to Parent copies of all material insurance policies issued in favor
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a named insured or otherwise a beneficiary, as well

the Company, no insurer issuing any such Material Policy has been declared

that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover
Proposal, (ii) provide any nonpublic information concerning the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to any person or group in connection with any Takeover

potential Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof
instruct each person (if any) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement and confidential
agreements that have expired pursuant to their terms) relating to a Takeover
Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company
promptly to return to the Company or destroy all information, documents, and

businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to such person or
any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement, and shall enforce (including by seeking an
injunction) the contractual rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such agreement with respect thereto, and shall enforce, and not
waive, terminate or modify without Parents prior written consent, any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other
agreement with such person; _provided_ that the Company may waive any
standstill or similar provisions to the extent necessary to permit a person to
make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board, a Takeover Proposal,
conditioned upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Takeover Proposal
to Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as contemplated by this _Section 5.02_
( _provided_ , _further_ that the Company may only take such action if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law). The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits
the Company from providing to Parent the information required to be provided
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.02_.

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any license of Intellectual Property Rights entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business), or (2) shares of Company Common Stock or any
other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary Securities, which together with
any other shares of Company Common Stock or other Company Securities or
Company Subsidiary Securities beneficially owned by such person or group,
would represent 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary Securities, (b) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or
group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or other Company Securities or Company Subsidiary
Securities, (c) any merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group (or the shareholders of any
person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting

more of the aggregate fair market value of the consolidated assets (including
Intellectual Property Rights) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (d) any reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend,
liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business represents 20% or more of
the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Takeover

in a person or group owning, directly or indirectly, (a) more than 80% of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (b) more than 80% of the
aggregate fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) to be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company
from a financial point of view than the Merger, in each case, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including after giving effect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing pursuant to _Section 5.02(e)_) that the Company
Board determines to be relevant and which the Company Board determines to be
reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms (including,
in the case of a cash transaction (in whole or in part), the Company Board
determining that financing is then fully committed or reasonably determined to
be available), taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines to be
relevant.

contrary contained in _Section 5.02(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, (i)

party that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.02_, and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take such action described in clause (A) or (B) of
this _Section 5.02(b)_ would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that the Company shall substantially
concurrently provide to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any person and which was not
previously provided to Parent), and/or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that prior to or concurrently with the Company
taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) of this _Section 5.02(b)_,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination of
the Company Board as provided for in this _Section 5.02(b)_.

 



 

(c) __Notice to Parent of Takeover Proposals__. The Company shall promptly
(and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing in the event that the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal, or any initial
request for nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries related to, or from any person or group in connection with, any

that the Company do so (or subsequently withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify (or publicly propose to do so), in a manner adverse to Parent, such
recommendation against such Takeover Proposal) or fail to issue a press

_Section 5.02(d)(vi)_ (to the extent related to _Section 5.02(d)(i)_ or
_Section 5.02(d)(v)_)) in response to an Intervening Event; _provided_ that
(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(2) in the case of _Section 5.02(e)(x)_, the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that the applicable Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, (3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub, at least four (4) Business Days in advance, that it will take the
applicable action referred to in _Section 5.02(e)(x)_ or _Section
5.02(e)(y)_ and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor (a "
_Notice of Intended Recommendation Change_ ") (which notice shall not itself
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), and (4) the Company has complied
in all material respects with the following additional covenants:

 



 

(i) if such action is being taken pursuant to _Section 5.02(e)(x)_, and if
requested by Parent, after providing any such Notice of Intended
Recommendation Change, the Company shall, shall cause its directors and
officers to and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good
faith during any such four (4) Business Day period (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(and in any event including any amendment to any price term thereof) shall
require a new Notice of Intended Recommendation Change and compliance with the
other requirements of this _Section 5.02(e)_ anew except that references
herein to a four (4) Business Day period shall be deemed to be references to a
two (2) Business Day period) regarding any written proposal by Parent to amend
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (or
two (2) Business Day period in the case of a material amendment) the Company
Board again makes the determinations described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
_Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to _Section
5.02(e)(y)_:

 



 

(1) such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made as a result of an event,
fact, development or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets
or operations of the Company and that was not known or reasonably foreseeable
by the Company Board as of the date hereof and becomes known to the Company
Board after the date hereof (each, an " _Intervening Event_ "); _provided_
that in no event shall any of the following constitute or be deemed to be an
Intervening Event: (I) any event, fact, development or circumstance resulting
from any breach of this Agreement by the Company, (II) the receipt, existence
or terms of any Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or any
consequences thereof, (III) any action taken by any party pursuant to and in
compliance with the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and
any consequences of such action, (IV) general changes in the industry in which
the Company operates (unless such changes disproportionately affect the
Company as compared with other participants in the industry in which the
Company operates, and then only to the extent of such disproportionate
effect), (V) the fact, in and of itself, that the

 



     

 

 



 

Company exceeds any internal or published projections or (VI) changes, in and
of themselves, in the price of the Company Common Stock; and

 



 

(2) during any such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
any written proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby and at the end of such
four (4) Business Day period the Company Board again makes the determinations
described in clause (1) of this _Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to such
Intervening Event.

 



 

(f) __Communications with Stockholders__. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.02_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this _Section 5.02_. In addition,
nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from
making the following communications, and no such statements will be deemed, in
and of themselves, to constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change: (i) a
"stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable
Takeover Proposal, (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Recommendation or
(iv) a factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys
receipt and review of a Takeover Proposal, the terms thereof and the identity
of the person making such Takeover Proposal, and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto, _provided_ that such public statement contains
an express reaffirmation of the Recommendation. Nothing in this Agreement will
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from making any other statement to
the stockholders of the Company (including regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that
the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, has
determined in good faith is required by applicable Law; _provided_ that
nothing in this sentence shall permit the Company Board to make any Adverse
Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in
accordance with, _Section 5.02(e)_.

 



 

 _Article VI_

 



 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 



 

Section 6.01. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than 20 Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, in
consultation with Parent, and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Subject to _Section 5.02(e)_, the Company and the Company Board
shall include the Recommendation in the proxy statement to be filed with the
SEC in connection with seeking the Requisite Company Vote (including the
letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates that is

 



     

 

 



 

required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included
in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement, and each of the Company and Parent covenants
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) will, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or on the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of any material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not false or misleading. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments (written or oral) of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements
thereto, prior to filing such documents with the SEC or disseminating them to
the Companys stockholders and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all responses to requests for additional information, and shall consider
any comments proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company will cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as
promptly as practicable, and in no event more than five (5) Business Days,
after the later of (i) the expiration of the ten (10)-day waiting period
provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) the date
on which the Company learns the SEC staff has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of any material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Parties and correct such information, and the Company shall file an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC.

 



 

(b) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and
notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable, and in no event more than forty-five (45) days after
the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or the date on which the Company learns the
SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") with a
record date and meeting date to be selected after reasonable consultation with
Parent, and, subject to an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 5.02(e)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Within three (3) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon the reasonable request of
Parent), the Company shall conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule
14a-13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting that is twenty (20) Business Days after

 



      

 

 



 

the date of such "broker search." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
that if at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement, Parent
reasonably determines in good faith that the Requisite Company Vote is
unlikely to be obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting, including due to
an absence of quorum, then Parent shall have the right to require an
adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of this Agreement; _provided_
, _further_ , that no such single adjournment or postponement shall delay the
Company Stockholders Meeting by more than seven (7) days from the prior-
scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding
the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if (i) there are holders of an
insufficient number of shares present or represented by proxy at the Company
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum, (ii) the Company determines in
good faith that it must solicit additional votes in favor of this Agreement to
obtain the Requisite Company Vote or (iii) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law (as determined
by the Company in good faith after consultation with Parent) or a request from
the SEC or its staff; _provided_ that no such adjournment or postponement
shall delay the Company Stockholders Meeting by more than seven (7) days from
the prior-scheduled date (after giving effect to any prior adjournment or
postponement) or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding
the Outside Date. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the
Company shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for
approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any
Takeover Proposal for approval by the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_, the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
afford to Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice
to the Company, to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties,
books and records (but excluding any confidential information contained in
personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such information is prohibited
by Privacy Laws and any documents, records or information that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the process that led to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement or, subject to the disclosure
requirements set forth in _Section 5.02_, to any Takeover Proposal) and to
those employees of the Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access, and,
during such period, and subject to the limitations described in parentheses
above in this _Section 6.02_, the Company shall furnish to Parent, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, (a) all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (b) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
or state securities laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would (i) reasonably be expected
to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or violate any

 



     

 

 



 

confidentiality obligations to a third party (in which case the Company will
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents and the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to institute
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practical in the
circumstances), or (ii) contravene any applicable Law. Parent and the Company
shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives (as
applicable) to comply with, all of their respective obligations provided in
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the
Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied, in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable; (ii) obtain
all necessary Governmental Authorizations of or by any Governmental Authority
and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with, and
notices to, such Governmental Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR Act)
and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid an Action by, any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) vigorously defend or
contest any Action brought by any private party that would otherwise prevent
or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Litigation. " _Transaction Litigation_ " means any Action
commenced or threatened against any Party or any of its Affiliates by any
private party relating to, arising out of or involving this Agreement
(including any stockholder litigation, regardless of whether the claims
therein are brought directly by stockholders or on behalf of the Company or
otherwise), the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or
that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Transaction Litigation shall
not include any Action brought or threatened by any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees
to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby reasonably
promptly after the date hereof, (ii) make appropriate filings pursuant to the
Foreign Merger Control Laws of Austria, Germany, Japan, South Korea and, in
the event that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority requests a Merger
Notice to be submitted, the United Kingdom (collectively, " _Specified Foreign
Merger Control Laws_ "), formally or in draft form (where pre-filing
consultation is required), reasonably promptly after the date hereof, (iii)
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
Specified Foreign Merger Control Laws, and (iv) use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause

 



     

 

 



 

to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with
this _Section 6.03_ to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods, or receipt of required Governmental Authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act and the Specified Foreign Merger Control Laws as
soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall request
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. No Party shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or withdraw its
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made
pursuant to any Specified Foreign Merger Control Law or other regulatory Law
unless each of the other Parties has given its prior written consent to such
extension or withdrawal.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this _Section 6.03_ nor the
"reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to require
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, in order to obtain any required approval from any Governmental
Authority or any third party, to: (i) (A) sell, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such
action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to,
any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other
encumberment, or holding separate, before or after the Effective Time, of any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take
any other action or agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on
freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes
in, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses
or interest therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) if taking any such
action described in clause _(i)_ or _(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries. For the
purposes of this _Section 6.03(c)_, a material adverse effect shall be
measured relative to the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, regardless of whether such actions are imposed on, or affect Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other Party apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or any of its
Representatives, or the Company or any of its Representatives, as the case may
be, from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and
Parent will furnish to the other Party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Party may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly informing the other Party of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any substantive presentations or submissions to a
Governmental Authority, giving the other Party the opportunity to review in
advance any proposed substantive submissions to a Governmental Authority and
considering in good faith any comments provided by the other Party on such
submission, and supplying each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between any

 



     

 

 



 

Party, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand,
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that each Party shall be entitled to redact any information relating to
valuation. Each of the Company and Parent will give the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to attend any meetings, or to participate in any
material communications with, a Governmental Authority to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
_Section 6.01(a)_, and not this _Section 6.03(d)_, shall govern the matters
referred to in _Section 6.01(a)_.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall keep each other reasonably informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation, but only to the extent that doing so
would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Party, jeopardize any legal
privilege of such Party with respect thereto, it being agreed that each Party
will reasonably cooperate with the other Parties to permit such inspection of
or to disclose such information in a manner that does not compromise or waive
such privilege with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing and the Company shall cooperate fully with Parent (and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to cooperate
fully with Parent) in connection with, and shall consult with and permit
Parent and its Representatives to participate in, the defense, negotiations or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and the Company shall give due
consideration to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation.
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
its or their Representatives to, compromise, settle, come to a settlement
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent thereto unless in
each case Parent shall consent thereto in advance in writing.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the
delisting of the Company and of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

 



 

(g) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time all required
consents, approvals or waivers from any third party in connection with the
Merger, including as required under any Material Contracts, and participate in
any related discussions or negotiations with Parent upon Parents reasonable
request; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses in connection
therewith, unless Parent agrees to pay or promptly reimburse the Company or
its applicable Subsidiary therefor if this Agreement shall be terminated in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 6.04. _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed
or purports to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or this
Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby, then the
Company and the Company Board, as applicable, shall take all action necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated

 



     

 

 



 

as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act
to eliminate the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse Recommendation
Change shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing
any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Employee_ "), for so long as such Company Employee remains employed
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during such period, (i) base salary (for
the avoidance of doubt, excluding any supplemental pay) that is at least equal
to that provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) cash incentive compensation opportunities (including with respect
to individual target bonus levels) that are no less favorable than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries); (iii) other employee benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (iv) subject to _Section 6.05(e)_, upon a termination
without cause of a Company Employee, severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 



 

(b) Each Company Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors, if applicable,
for purposes of eligibility for vacation and service recognition awards under
the employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of
their Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee becomes a participant, and
eligibility under the Family and Medical Leave Act; _provided_ that foregoing
service credit shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) With respect to each health and welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of Company Employees, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) under such plan to the extent that
such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were waived or satisfied under
the comparable health or welfare benefit plans of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) each Company Employee (or his or her
eligible dependents) to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by the Company Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) under any similar
Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under such plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
anticipated Effective Time, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is
necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plans (collectively, the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the day prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs. Following the Effective Time and as soon as
practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the
assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to
the extent permitted by Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plan_"), permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans to participants)
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash (or in the case of loans,
notes), in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume, perform and discharge in
accordance with their applicable terms (including any applicable rights to
amend or terminate any such arrangements) all obligations of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries under the Company Stock Plans, each Company Benefit

respect to indemnification, exculpation, limitation of liabilities and

expenses in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.06(a)_, from and after the Effective Time, in
the event of any threatened or actual Action, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in
a capacity as a member of any board committee), or officer of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including payment of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with
any such threatened or actual Action. Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party has validly sought indemnification
under such indemnification agreement; _provided_ that no Indemnified Party
will be liable for any settlement of such matter effected without his or her
prior written consent. Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations
under this _Section 6.06(b)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a

such coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of
such policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium
for such

 



     

 

 



 

insurance policies in excess of 300 % of the annual premium paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (which
amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section 6.06(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter) (the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Premium, if and to the extent available commercially, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable
national insurance company (with comparable credit ratings to the Companys
existing carrier) the material terms of which, including with respect to
coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to any
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (prior to the
Closing Date) may (after reasonable consultation with Parent), or at Parents
written request prior to the Closing Date will, or Parent or the Surviving
Corporation upon the Effective Time may, obtain in lieu of the insurance
contemplated by the preceding sentence a prepaid (or "tail") directors and
officers liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6) years from the Effective Time,
covering each person who is covered by such policies on the date hereof on
terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those
of such policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that the maximum
premium for such tail insurance policy shall not be in excess of the Maximum
Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such tail policy may not be
amended, modified or cancelled or revoked by the Company, Parent or the

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and other
assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation and Parent, respectively,
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.06_ unless assumed by operation of Law.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions
of this _Section 6.06_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs. The provisions of
this _Section 6.06_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by contract or otherwise.

the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form mutually
agreed to by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) to the extent the
content of any press release or other public statement is substantially the
same as a statement previously issued in accordance with this _Section 6.07_,
no separate approval shall be required in respect of such content to the
extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press release or other
public statement, and (b) the Parties may make public statements in response
to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analysts conference calls, so long as any such
statements are consistent with the initial press release and other press
releases and public statements made jointly by the Parties or made by one
Party in accordance with this _Section 6.07_ and do not reveal material
nonpublic information regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Merger Sub, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a

and its Subsidiaries at such time).

may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispositions of Company Securities (including derivative

director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.10. _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise,

complete control and supervision over their own business and operations.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 6.11. _Intellectual Property Matters_. The Company will use reasonable

the amounts contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 8.03(e)_)
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the termination
thereof or any matter forming a basis for such termination). If the Company

Section 9.03. _Interpretation_.

 



 

(a) When a reference is made herein to an Article, a Section, Annex or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or a Section of, or an Annex or
Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 



 

(b) The table of contents, headings and index of defined terms contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and
effect of the word "shall." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The word "or" when used herein is not exclusive. Any
references herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean U.S. dollars. The words "as
of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" and words of similar
import shall be deemed in each case to refer to the date of this Agreement as
set forth in the Preamble hereto.

 



 

(d) The phrase "made available," when used in reference to anything made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to
mean uploaded to and made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives in complete and unredacted form no less than one (1) Business
Day prior to the date hereof in the online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company by Merrill Corporation under the name "Project Peahi."

 



 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against any Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 



 

(f) References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
All terms defined herein shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein.

 



 

(g) All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Letter shall
have the meanings ascribed to them herein. Any information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify (i) the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number and (ii) in the case of information set forth in
_Article III_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each other Section or
subsection of _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such information is relevant to such other Section or
subsection. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as
an exception to a representation or warranty or covenant, as

 



     

 

 



 

applicable, shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) The definitions contained herein are applicable to the singular as well as
the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine
and neuter genders of such terms.

 



 

(i) Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and annexes hereto or thereto, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents and certificates delivered
pursuant hereto, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and

 



     

 

 



 

understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the

that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.05. _Third-_ _Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as specifically
provided in the provisions of _Section 6.06_ (with respect to which the
Indemnified Parties shall be the sole third-party beneficiaries) or (b) from
and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms
of and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor
any other agreement contemplated hereby is intended to or shall confer upon
any person other than the Parties hereto and thereto any legal or equitable
rights or remedies. The representations and warranties herein are the product
of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 8.05_ without notice or liability
to any other person. The representations and warranties herein may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters.

 



 

Section 10.06. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may transfer or assign
all or any part of their respective rights, in whole or in part, under this
Agreement or under any related document to any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (it being understood that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder). No assignment by any Party in violation
of this Agreement shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 10.07. _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW,
IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BE BASED UPON, RELATE
TO OR ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR
THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO ANY LAWS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF
ANOTHER JURISDICTION; _PROVIDED_ THAT MATTERS RELATING TO (A) ARTICLE I AND
(B) THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE COMPANY BOARD AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
MERGER SUB SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 10.08. _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle
County in the State of Delaware, for the purpose of any Action directly or
indirectly based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby, or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect to such Action shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined,
exclusively in such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any Action so brought.
Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any Action may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the
addresses set forth in _Section 10.03_. Nothing in this _Section 10.08_
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 10.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO OR
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 



 

Section 10.10. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the Merger

 



     

 

 



 

or the transactions contemplated hereby) is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree
that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with _Section 10.08_, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in
equity.

 



 

Section 10.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.12. _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered
by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable
document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.

Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
