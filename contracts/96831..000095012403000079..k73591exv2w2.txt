defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend Sections 2.3.1, 2.4.1
and 10.1 of the Agreement as described herein and to add a new Section 9.6.7
to the Agreement.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises
herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Purchaser, Sellers and
Invensys agree to amend the Agreement as follows:  1. Section 2.3.1 is
hereby amended by adding, immediately after the phrase "minus the Escrow
Funds", the following:   "and, if a certificate from the Canadian Minister
of National Revenue  under Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) with a
limit at least  equal to the allocation to Fasco Motors Limited (set forth in
Section  2.4.1) is not received on or prior to the Closing Date, minus the 
Canadian Withholding Amount"  2. Section 2.4.1 is hereby replaced in its
entirety with the following:   Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate (i)
39,250,000 Canadian dollars  to Fasco Motors Limited (Canada) and (ii) the
balance of the Initial  Purchase Price (which shall be determined by
subtracting the amount  described in clause (i) as converted to US dollars at
the closing  mid-point US dollar spot rate shown in the Financial Times
published on  the second Business Day before the Closing) among the
remaining  Companies at or prior to Closing. Within thirty (30) days
following the  later of the determination of the Adjustment Amount or the
Pension Plan  Assets Adjustment, Sellers and Purchaser shall agree upon a
revised  purchase price       allocation to reflect such adjustments in
accordance with the character  of each such adjustment and in a manner that
is consistent with the  allocation of the Initial Purchase Price; provided,
that, for purposes  of Section 2.4, no such adjustments shall be allocable to
Fasco Motors  Limited (Canada).  3. The following is added to the Agreement
as a new Section 9.6.7:   9.6.7 Notwithstanding the issuance of a
certificate from the Canadian Minister of National Revenue as described in
Section 2.3.1, in the event that the Canadian authorities reject, challenge,
or invalidate such certificate or seek an adjustment of any kind from
Purchaser with regard to the Canadian Withholding Amount, such rejection,
challenge, invalidation, or adjustment shall constitute a Seller Tax Act
subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 9.6.1.  4. Section
10.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the following defined
term in alphabetical order:   "Canadian Withholding Amount" shall mean the
amount that is required to be withheld by the Purchaser (or any Affiliate of
the Purchaser that purchases the shares of Fasco Motors Limited (Canada))
pursuant to Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (based upon the
allocation to Fasco Motors Limited (Canada) set forth in Section 2.4)
converted to US dollars at the closing mid-point US dollar spot rate shown in
the Financial Times published on the first Business Day before the
Closing.  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the
failure to obtain a certificate under Section 116 of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) shall not constitute a condition to Closing.  6. Except as set
forth herein, the Agreement is not otherwise amended in any respect.  7.
This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.  8. This
Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.       2   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties
hereto have caused this Amendment to be executed by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first written above.   TECUMSEH
