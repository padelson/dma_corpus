         WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend Sections 2.3.1, 2.4.1 and 10.1 of
the Agreement as described herein and to add a new Section 9.6.7 to the
Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises herein contained
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, Purchaser, Sellers and Invensys agree to amend
the Agreement as follows:

1.       Section 2.3.1 is hereby amended by adding, immediately after the phrase
"minus the Escrow Funds", the following:

         "and, if a certificate from the Canadian Minister of National Revenue
         under Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) with a limit at least
         equal to the allocation to Fasco Motors Limited (set forth in Section
         2.4.1) is not received on or prior to the Closing Date, minus the
         Canadian Withholding Amount"

2.       Section 2.4.1 is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following:

         Sellers and Purchaser agree to allocate (i) 39,250,000 Canadian dollars
         to Fasco Motors Limited (Canada) and (ii) the balance of the Initial
         Purchase Price (which shall be determined by subtracting the amount
         described in clause (i) as converted to US dollars at the closing
         mid-point US dollar spot rate shown in the Financial Times published on
         the second Business Day before the Closing) among the remaining
         Companies at or prior to Closing. Within thirty (30) days following the
         later of the determination of the Adjustment Amount or the Pension Plan
         Assets Adjustment, Sellers and Purchaser shall agree upon a revised
         purchase price



<PAGE>

         allocation to reflect such adjustments in accordance with the character
         of each such adjustment and in a manner that is consistent with the
         allocation of the Initial Purchase Price; provided, that, for purposes
         of Section 2.4, no such adjustments shall be allocable to Fasco Motors
         Limited (Canada).

3. The following is added to the Agreement as a new Section 9.6.7:

                  9.6.7 Notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate from the
Canadian Minister of National Revenue as described in Section 2.3.1, in the
event that the Canadian authorities reject, challenge, or invalidate such
certificate or seek an adjustment of any kind from Purchaser with regard to the
Canadian Withholding Amount, such rejection, challenge, invalidation, or
adjustment shall constitute a Seller Tax Act subject to the indemnification
provisions of Section 9.6.1.

4. Section 10.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the following
defined term in alphabetical order:

                  "Canadian Withholding Amount" shall mean the amount that is
required to be withheld by the Purchaser (or any Affiliate of the Purchaser that
purchases the shares of Fasco Motors Limited (Canada)) pursuant to Section 116
of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (based upon the allocation to Fasco Motors
Limited (Canada) set forth in Section 2.4) converted to US dollars at the
closing mid-point US dollar spot rate shown in the Financial Times published on
the first Business Day before the Closing.

5. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the failure to obtain a
certificate under Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) shall not
constitute a condition to Closing.

6. Except as set forth herein, the Agreement is not otherwise amended in any
respect.

7. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

8. This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
