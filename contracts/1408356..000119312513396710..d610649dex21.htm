a California corporation and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub One") Zoom Acquisition LLC, a California limited liability
company and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub Two" and

RECITALS

 

A. The boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Subs and the Company have
determined it is advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and
their respective stockholders or shareholders, as the case may be, that Parent
and the Company enter into a business combination transaction in accordance
with the California Corporation Code (the "CCC") pursuant to which, among
other things, Merger Sub One will merge with and into the Company (the "First
Step Merger"), and, in furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement and
the Merger. As soon as practicable following the First Step Merger, and as
part of a single integrated transaction, Parent will cause the Company, as the
surviving entity in the First Step Merger, to merge with and into Merger Sub
Two, with Merger Sub Two continuing as the surviving entity (the "Second Step
Merger" and, taken together with the First Step Merger, the "Merger"). For
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
that this Agreement will be, and is hereby, adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368 2(g) of the U.S. Income
Tax Regulations promulgated under the Code (the "Treasury Regulations").

B. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (i) the Company will be the
surviving corporation of the First Step Merger, (ii) Merger Sub One will be
the merged corporation and shall cease to exist in accordance with the CCC,
(iii) all issued and outstanding Company Capital Stock will be converted into
the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration as set forth herein
and (iv) certain issued and outstanding Company Options will be assumed and
certain issued and outstanding Company Options will be cancelled.

C. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter
into this Agreement, (i) each of the Key Employees listed on Schedule
7.2(h)(ii) shall enter into a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement
with Parent, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(collectively, the "Key Employee Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation
Agreements"), and (ii) each Key Employee shall execute an offer letter
(collectively, the "Key Employee Offer Letters"), each to be effective as of
the Effective Time.

D. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, as a material inducement to Parent and Merger Subs to enter
into this Agreement, certain holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or
Company Options set forth in Schedule I (each, a "Designated Securityholder")
shall execute and deliver to Parent and Merger Subs (i) Voting Agreements, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a "Voting
Agreement" and collectively, the "Voting Agreements") and (ii) Joinder and
Waiver Agreements, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(each, a "Joinder Agreement" and collectively, the "Joinder Agreements"). E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Subs, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, mutual agreements, covenants and other promises
set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereto hereby agree

Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company, or the
holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock:

 

(a) _Merger Sub One Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub One or the
Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

consideration therefor and shall thereupon cease to exist.

 

(c) _Dissenting Shares of Company Capital Stock_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 2.7, Dissenting Shares shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.8.

(d) _Company Capital Stock Generally_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of
any Company Shareholder, at the Effective Time each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other

issued and outstanding shares of the Company Preferred Stock shall be
converted into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the approval of the
Company Shareholders as set forth in the Shareholder Written Consent and
section 3.1(d) of the Companys Articles of Incorporation.

(f) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(i) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option set forth in Schedule
2.7(f)(i) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Continuing Employee shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Common
Stock (collectively, the "Assumed Options"). Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, each such Assumed Option will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and the
agreements evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including the vesting schedule thereof, except that (A) each such
Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_ (2) the Per Share
Merger Consideration and rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such Assumed Option shall
be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Assumed Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_ (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, rounded up to the nearest whole cent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the exercise price of the Assumed Options, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such Assumed Option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such Assumed Option shall be determined in order to comply with
Section 409A, and in the case of any Assumed Options to which Code Section 421
applies by reason of its qualification under Code Section 422, Code Section
424\.

 

(ii) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, each Company Option that is not set forth on Schedule
2.7(f)(i) that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Holders of Unvested Company Options that are terminated and
cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.7(f)(ii) shall be entitled to receive the
payment of cash consideration, less applicable Tax withholding, in exchange
for the cancellation of such options in connection with the consummation
of the First Step Merger as set forth in Schedule 2.7(f)(ii) (such cash
consideration, the "Unvested Option Cashout"). The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each such holder an
executed Option Cancellation Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (an "Option Cancellation Agreement"). To the extent that,
Parent, the Interim Surviving Entity or the Final Surviving Entity pays
to the Holders of Unvested Options pursuant to such holders Option
Cancellation Agreement following the Effective Time such portion of the
Unvested Option Cashout not paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
such portion of the Unvested Option Cashout so payable by Parent, the Interim
Surviving Entity or the Final Surviving Entity (together with any employer-
side Tax obligations attributed thereto) shall be deemed to be Change of
Control Fees.

 

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the review and approval of
Parent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by Section 2.7(f)(i) and 2.7(f)(ii) under the Plan
and all Company Option agreements and any other applicable plan or arrangement
of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal),
including adopting all resolutions and giving all requisite notices to each
holder of Company Options. Materials to be submitted to the holders of Company
Options in connection with any notice required under this Section 2.7(f)(iii)
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld.

(g) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. No outstanding Company Warrants, if any,
shall be assumed by Parent, and the Company shall cause each such Company
Warrant to be either (i) exercised by the

 



17  holder of such Company Warrant in full or (ii) to the extent not exercised
in full, terminated, cancelled or automatically converted into shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as of immediately prior to
the Closing, either pursuant to its terms or pursuant to an agreement with the
holder thereof.

(h)  _Tax Consequences_. No party hereto shall take any action, or fail to
take any action (including after the Closing Date), which is inconsistent with
the intent that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization," unless required
by any applicable legal requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder of
Company Capital Stock regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any of the
Tax consequences to the Company or any holder of Company Capital Stock of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements
contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company and the holders
of Company Capital Stock are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby.

(i)  _Withholding of Taxes_. The Company, Parent, the Interim Surviving
Entity, the Final Surviving Entity and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock, a Company
Option or a Company Warrant such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(j) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the First Step Merger, but in lieu thereof, each Company
Securityholder that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender
of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in Section 2.14, receive from Parent
an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
less the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated by Section 2.7(g)
which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product
of: (i) such fraction, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Closing Price.

2.8 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Company Shareholder who has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such Company Shareholders dissenters rights
under applicable Law (any such shares, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration for such Company Shareholders shares of Company Capital Stock
set forth in Section 2.7, but in lieu thereof, such Company Shareholder shall
be entitled to such rights as are provided by applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.8(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters rights under applicable Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock, as
applicable, set forth in Section 2.7 and upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares in accordance with the terms of Section 2.10.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demand for
dissenters rights or other payment received by the Company pursuant to the
applicable provisions of applicable Law, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such

 



18  demands. Any written communication to be made by the Company to any Company
Shareholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and shall not be presented to any Company Shareholder prior to the
Company receiving Parents consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that Parent, the Interim Surviving Entity, the Final Surviving Entity
or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting
Shares in excess of the value of the Merger Consideration that otherwise would
have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement
(except for cash payments paid by the Company (using the Companys cash) in
compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.8 prior to the Effective Time
in respect thereof) or (ii) incurs any Losses (including attorneys and
consultants fees, and out of pocket costs and expenses, and including any
such fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending against or settling any action or proceeding) in respect of
any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares and excluding any
such Losses incurred and paid by the Company (using the Companys cash) prior
to the Effective Time) ((i) and (ii) together "Dissenting Share Payments"),
Parent shall be entitled to recover, under the terms of Article VIII, the
amount of such Dissenting Share Payments.

on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders, on the other hand. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall determine all disputed items and amounts and
its decision in respect thereof shall be final and binding upon Parent and the
Shareholder Representative; and

 

(C) for all purposes of and under this Agreement, the Actual Closing Net
Working Capital shall mean the Closing Net Working Capital based upon (1) all

representatives (including accountants and counsel) (subject to the execution
and delivery by the Shareholder Representative of a confidentiality agreement
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) with reasonable access

21 2.10 _Closing Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Escrow Amount Deposit_. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, and in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof, Parent shall
deposit the Escrow Amount, out of the Merger Consideration otherwise
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.7, with the Escrow Agent.

 

(b) _Expense Escrow Deposit_. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, and in any event within one (1) Business Day thereof, Parent shall
deposit the Expense Escrow Amount, out of the Merger Consideration otherwise
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.7, with the Escrow Agent.

 

(c) _Closing Payments_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, after consultation with Parent and in
compliance with applicable Law, the Company shall mail a letter
of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the
"Letter of Transmittal") to each Company Shareholder at the address set forth
opposite each such Company Shareholders name on the Spreadsheet. 

(ii) Upon surrender of a certificate that formerly represented their
respective shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates")
for cancellation to Parent or its agent, together with the Letter of
Transmittal, Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8 and any other
instruments that Parent or its agent reasonably requests (the "Exchange
Documents"), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive from Parent or its agent in exchange therefor,
that portion of the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company
Capital Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.7 (determined, solely for purposes of
this Section 2.10(c), as if the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration required
to determine the Merger Consideration in accordance with the definition
thereof was the Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration), less the sum of (A)
such Company Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount contributed
with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(a) and (B) such Company
Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the Expense Escrow Amount contributed
with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(b). Parent or its agent shall
deliver such consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be
delivered in a book-entry or similar position through The Depository Trust and
Clearing Corporation or any other depository or similar functionary, credited
to an account for the benefit of such Company Shareholder) specified in the
preceding sentence to a Company Shareholder promptly following the receipt by
Parent or its agent of such Company Shareholders Company Stock Certificates
and Exchange Documents, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto. Upon the surrender of any such Company Stock
Certificate, the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall thereupon be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding
after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate purposes
thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.7.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2.10(c) and subject to the
Companys timely compliance with Section 6.14, in the event that any Company
Shareholder delivers Company Stock Certificates and duly completed and
executed Exchange Documents for his, her or its shares of Company Capital
Stock to Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered the applicable consideration for
such shares of Company Capital Stock to such Company Shareholders in
accordance with Section 2.10(c)(ii) within one (1) Business Day after the
Closing Date.

(d) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business
Days) following the determination of the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.9(a)(iv), (i) in the event that the Final Adjusted
Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Adjusted Merger Consideration
(such 

 



22  difference, the "Shortfall Amount"), Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release from the
Escrow Fund and deliver to Parent either (A) if a portion of the Escrow Fund
is comprised of shares of Parent Common Stock, such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as is equal to the Shortfall Amount divided by the Closing Price
or (B) if the Escrow Fund is comprised solely of cash, an amount in cash
equal to the Shortfall Amount, or (ii) in the event that the Final Adjusted
Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Adjusted Merger
Consideration (such excess, the "Excess Amount"), Parent or its agent shall
deliver to the Company Shareholders, in accordance with each such Company
Shareholders Pro Rata Portion, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Excess Amount.

 

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All consideration
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of Interim Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Interim Surviving Entity
or the Final Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.12 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Subs, the Interim Surviving Entity, the
Final Surviving Entity or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock for any shares transferred or amounts paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. At any time following the last day of the six (6) month period
following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require its agent
to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all Merger
Consideration that has been deposited with such agent pursuant to this
Agreement, and not disbursed pursuant to Section 2.7, and thereafter
the Company Shareholders shall be entitled to look only to Parent for their
claims, as general creditors thereof, with respect to shares of Parent capital
stock and any and all cash amounts that may be payable to such Persons
pursuant to Section 2.7 or Section 2.10. No interest shall be payable for the
cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2.12 and which are subsequently delivered to the Company Shareholders. 

2.13 _Transfers of Ownership_. If any payments are to be made to a Person
other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment
of any portion of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

2.14 _Surrender of Company Stock Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Company Stock Certificates_. No portion of the Merger Consideration shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect
to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall have
surrendered such Company Stock Certificate and the Exchange Documents
pursuant hereto. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or its agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required
pursuant to Section 2.7; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or its agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the Person who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates to either (a) deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably
direct, or (b) provide an indemnification agreement in a form and substance
acceptable to Parent or its agent, against any Claim that may be made against
Parent or its agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.15 _Additional Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Capital Stock
hereunder, and any other applicable numbers or

 



23  amounts, shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Capital Stock occurring or having a record date on or after
the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.16 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Interim Surviving Entity and after the Second Step
Merger, the Final Surviving Entity, with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company, Parent, Merger Subs, and the officers and directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Subs are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

subject, in the case of the Interim Financials, to normal year-end adjustments
and except that the Interim Financials do not contain footnotes and other

correct and complete in all material respects and present fairly in all
material respects the Companys consolidated financial condition, operating
results and cash flows as of the dates and during the periods
indicated therein, subject in the case of the Interim Financials to normal
year-end adjustments, which are not material in amount or significance in any
individual case or in the aggregate. The Companys unaudited consolidated
balance sheet contained in the Interim Financials is referred to hereinafter

such term is defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with the Company Auditors
or any of its other auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during
any of its past three full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-
date. The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become
a party to, any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K). The Company has identified all uncertain Tax positions
contained in all Returns filed by the Company, and has established adequate
reserves and made appropriate disclosures in the Financials in accordance
with the requirements of Financial Interpretation No. 48 of FASB Statement No.

licensed by or from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise used
or occupied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real
Property"), including the name of the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master
lessor and/or lessee, the date and term of the lease, license, sublease or
other occupancy right and each amendment thereto.

copies of all leases, lease guaranties, subleases, agreements for the leasing,
use or occupancy of, or otherwise granting a right in or relating to the
Leased Real Property, including all amendments, terminations
and modifications thereof ("Lease Agreements"); and there are no other Lease
Agreements affecting the Leased Real Property or to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound, other than those identified in Section 3.10(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule. All such Lease Agreements are valid and effective
in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
Lease Agreements, any existing material default, or event of default (or
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material
default), and no rentals are past due. The Company has not received any
written notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or
counterclaim with respect to any such Lease Agreement, which has not been
fully remedied and withdrawn. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently
occupies all of the Leased Real Property for the operation of its business.
There are no other parties occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased
Real Property. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owes brokerage
commissions or finders fees with respect to any such Leased Real Property or
is a party to any Contract or subject to any Claim that may require the
payment of any real estate broker commissions. The Company has performed in
all material respects all of its obligations under any termination agreements
pursuant to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other
occupancy agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing material liability with respect to such terminated agreements.

 

(c) The Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair in all
material respects, and is suitable for the conduct of the business as
presently conducted. Neither the operations of the Company on the Leased Real
Property nor, to the Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, including
the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect any
applicable building code, zoning requirement, ordinance, rule, regulation or
statute relating to such property or operations thereon, and any such non-
violation is not dependent on so called non-conforming use exceptions. There
is not existing, the Company has not received any written notice of, and to
the Knowledge of the Company, there is not presently contemplated or proposed,
any eminent domain, condemnation or similar action, or, to the Companys
Knowledge, zoning action or proceeding, with respect to any portion of the
Leased Real Property. To the Companys Knowledge, (i) there are no Laws now in
existence which would require the tenant of any Leased Real Property to make
any material expenditure to modify or improve such Leased Real Property to
bring it into compliance therewith, and (ii) the Company shall not be required
to expend more than $50,000 in the aggregate under all Lease Agreements to
restore the Leased Real Property at the end of the term of the applicable
Lease Agreement to the condition required under the Lease Agreement (assuming
the conditions existing in such Leased Real Property at the end of the term is
the same as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing).

 

(d) The Company or its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the
case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of
its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for
use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens

financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate under the
Fairness Hearing Law for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any

Commissioner has denied Parents application for a California Permit
following the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts by Parent to appeal

the Closing the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall obtain knowledge
of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Soliciting Materials in order to make statements contained or
incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable
Law; _provided_ that Parent shall only be required to provide notice of any
such facts to the extent such facts relate to information furnished in

(h) Promptly following receipt of written consents of the shareholders of the
Company constituting the Required Shareholder Approval, the Company shall
deliver notice of the approval of the First Step Merger and the other actions
approved by written consent of the shareholders of the Company, pursuant to
603(b) of the CCC (the "Shareholder Notice"). In the event the Company holds a

shareholders of the Company who have not executed the Shareholder
Written Consent, the Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of
the shareholders meeting (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") and shall not

Company Shareholders Meeting without the consent of the Parent.

(i) In the event that the Parent issues an Election Notice to the
Company pursuant to Section 6.1(c), the parties hereto agree to cooperate to
take such other actions necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_. The Company shall provide Parent and its

Subsidiaries as identified by Parent; and (b) during business hours and upon
reasonable advance written notice to the Company, copies of internal financial
statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon

deemed to amend or modify any representation or warranty set forth herein,
the Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or
otherwise limit, affect or prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of
Parent.

 

6.3 ___Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company or Parent, as the case
may be, shall give prompt notice to the other of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time, and (b) any failure of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply in all material respects
with or satisfy in all material respects any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company in writing, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or this Section 6.3 shall
not (x) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice provided hereunder or (y) be deemed to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentations,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

6.4 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 6.2 or pursuant
to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the

 



61  effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by
the terms of the Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the
Shareholder Representative shall not be required to return or destroy any
information pursuant thereto until such time as its responsibilities hereunder
are complete. In this regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent Common
Stock is publicly traded and that any information obtained during the course
of due diligence and negotiation of this Agreement and the Related Agreements
could be considered to be material nonpublic information within the meaning of
federal and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and
agrees not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or transactions
regarding the Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable securities Laws.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Reciprocal Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, following Closing, the Shareholder Representative
shall be permitted to disclose information as required by Law or to employees,
advisors or consultants of the Shareholder Representative and to the
Indemnifying Parties, in each case who have a need to know such information,
provided that such persons either (a) agree to observe the terms of this

Shareholder Representative of at least as high a standard as those imposed on
the Shareholder Representative under this Section 6.4.

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. The Company shall not (nor will it permit the
Company Representatives to) directly or indirectly issue any statement or
communication to any third Person (other than their respective legal counsel,
accountants or representatives that are bound by confidentiality
restrictions) regarding the existence or subject matter of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including with respect to any claim or
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the
interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination hereof), without
the consent of Parent; _provided,_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
the Company may, subject to Parents consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), issue communications regarding the
existence or subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby to its Employees, customers and suppliers, as reasonably necessary for
the Company to maintain its business relationships with such Persons or to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement, (b) any information
reasonably relevant for enforcing the Companys rights or defending against
assertions by Parent may be disclosed to any Governmental Entity or an
arbitrator or other involved party (e.g., opposing counsel, expert witnesses,
investigators) in connection with any legal proceedings involving a dispute
between Parent and the Company, or the interpretation, making, performance,
breach or termination hereof or thereof, (c) unless otherwise prohibited by
this Agreement, the Company Representatives may make statements to any third
Person (but not public statements or announcements) to the extent that
such information otherwise has been made public by Parent and (d) following
the public announcement of the Merger, the Shareholder Representative may
publicly announce the fact that it has been engaged to serve as the
Shareholder Representative in connection with the Merger, _provided_ that
such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein. Parent shall not
issue any statement or communication to any third Person (other than its
representatives that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including with respect to any claim or dispute arising out of or related to
this Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or
termination hereof), without first providing the Company with an opportunity
in advance to review and comment on such statement or communication, except
that this restriction shall be subject to Parents and its Affiliates
obligation to comply with applicable securities Laws and the rules of the
NASDAQ Global Market and Parent may, after consultation with the Company,
issue communications regarding the existence or subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to its Employees, customers
and suppliers, as reasonably necessary for Parent to maintain its business
relationships with such Persons or to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company have mutually
agreed upon a joint press release for the announcement of the First Step
Merger and this Agreement and related employee, customer and
supplier communications (the "Communications Plan") and the Company may issue
such joint press release, and the Company and the Company Representatives may
communicate with employees, customers and suppliers in accordance with
such Communications Plan, _provided_ , that Parent shall be entitled to make
any changes to such press release or Communications Plan subject to the
Companys consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

 



62 6.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be
taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and
regulations to satisfy all of the conditions to the obligations of the other
parties hereto and to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
to obtain all necessary waivers, consents approvals of any Governmental Entity
with respect to the consummation of the Merger and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity and to remove any
injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if any proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that Parent and the
Company shall consult and cooperate with one another as to the appropriate
response; _provided, further,_ that Parent shall not be required to agree to
(a) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of
any business, assets or properties of Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or of the Company, (b) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company to conduct their
respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold
or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in
the case of Parent, the businesses of the Company, or (c) the imposition of
any impediment on Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company under
any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal
restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices
(any such action described in (a), (b) or (c), an "Action of Divestiture").
Nothing herein shall require Parent or the Company to litigate with any
Governmental Entity. 

6.7 _Contract Consents, Amendments and Terminations_. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain all necessary consents,
waivers and approvals of any parties to any Contract as are required
thereunder in connection with the First Step Merger and/or the Second Step
Merger or for any such Contracts to remain in full force and effect, all of
which are required to be listed in Section 3.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
(b) provide all notices required under any Contract in connection with the
First Step Merger and/or the Second Step Merger, all of which such Contracts

Agreement Date and (e) terminate each of the agreements listed on Schedule
6.7(e) (the "Terminated Agreements"), effective as of and contingent upon the
Closing, including sending all required notices, such that each such
agreement shall be of no further force or effect immediately following the
Effective Time. Such requests for consents, waivers, approvals, modifications,
terminations or notices shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the foregoing. In the event that the other parties to any such Contract,
including a lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property, conditions its
grant of a consent, modification, waiver, termination or approval (including
by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or
otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent, modification or
termination request regarding the First Step Merger and/or the Second Step
Merger, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration, including increased rent payments or other payments under the
Contract or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty),
the Company shall be responsible for making all such payments (the "Consent
and Modification Fees"). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay (using
the Companys cash): (i) all Consent and Modification Fees; and (ii) all (A)
change of control, bonus, severance or other similar payments that are or will
be incurred by the Company with respect to Employees of the Company as of the

63  Company, the Company Securityholders or any other Person for any costs,
claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain
such consents, waivers, approvals, modifications or terminations providing

6.8 _Expenses and Fees_.

 

(a) If the First Step Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred by
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, including all
legal, accounting, financial advisory, and consulting fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Third Party Expenses"), shall be the obligation of the Company,
excluding any Covered SEC Costs. The Company shall provide Parent with a
statement of Estimated Third Party Expenses and an estimate of all Change of
Control Fees showing detail of both the paid and unpaid Third Party Expenses
and Change of Control Fees incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date, or
anticipated to be incurred or payable by the Company after the Closing Date
(the "Statement of Expenses"), at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, and the Statement of Expenses shall be certified by the
Companys Chief Financial Officer as true, correct and complete as of the
Closing Date. The Company shall pay (using the Companys cash) all of its
Third Party Expenses and any Change of Control Fees on or prior to the Closing
Date. Any of the Companys Third Party Expenses or any Change of Control Fees
that are not reflected on the Statement of Expenses and not accounted for in
the calculation of the Base Merger Consideration ("Excess Expenses and Fees")
may be paid out of the Escrow Fund.

 

(b) If the First Step Merger is not consummated, each party shall pay its own
fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith, and neither party shall be
liable to the other party for any costs or expenses incurred in connection
herewith, except that Parent will promptly reimburse the Company for any
Covered SEC Costs.

 

6.9 _280G Approval_. The Company shall promptly, submit to the shareholders of
the Company for approval by the requisite vote (in a manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of shareholders of the Company as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that
may, separately or in the aggregate, constitute a "parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which
determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent), such that all such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that (A) a
vote of the shareholders of the Company was solicited in conformance with
Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and that such
requisite shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any Section 280G
Payment (the "280G Approval"), or (B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained
with respect to any Section 280G Payment and as a consequence, that such
payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they
would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the
280G Waivers, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the
vote of the shareholders of the Company.

 

6.10 _Pre-Closing Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Each person who becomes an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing shall
be required by the Company to enter into and execute, an Employee Proprietary
Information Agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enforceable
and effective as of such employees first date of employment or service. Each
Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing shall be
required by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into and execute,
a Consultant Proprietary Information Agreement with the Company enforceable
and effective as of such consultant or contractors first date of service.

 



64 (b) The Company shall, prior to the Closing, cause each officer and director
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to execute a resignation and release
letter in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Director
and Officer Resignation Letter"), effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the Closing, pay
in full all bonus or other obligations owed pursuant to any "phantom stock"
or similar plan and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to receive
written acknowledgments and releases from each individual paid pursuant to any
"phantom stock" or similar plan that all payments due to such individual have
been paid.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the Closing, pay
in full all severance obligations under applicable Law to any Employee who
has been terminated prior to the Closing.

6.11 _Post-Closing Employee Matters_. Parent or its Affiliates may offer
certain U.S. Employees, including the Key Employees, employment by Parent, its
Subsidiaries, the Interim Surviving Entity and/or the Final Surviving Entity
as a Continuing Employee, to be effective as of the Closing Date, upon proof
of a legal right to work in the United States (such employees offered such
employment, the "Offered Employees"). Such employment will: (i) be set forth
in offer letters on Parents standard form, (ii) be subject to and in
compliance with Parents applicable policies and procedures, including
employment background checks and the execution of Parents employee
proprietary information agreement, governing employment conduct and
performance, (iii) have terms, including the position and salary, which will
be determined by Parent, (iv) include, if applicable, a waiver by the Employee
of any future equity-based compensation to which such Employee may otherwise
have been entitled, and (v) supersede any prior express or implied employment
agreements, arrangement or offer letter in effect prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (iii), the offers provided to the
Offered Employees shall provide for terms and conditions that maintain
substantially (x) the aggregate economic value of the total cash compensation
(including base salary, base hourly wage, target bonus and other cash-based
incentive payments, but excluding equity compensation) of each Continuing
Employee, and (y) the aggregate economic value of the benefits under the
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements for the benefit of such
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents and beneficiaries, in each
case, as provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, so as to not implement any substantial aggregate reduction in
the value of compensation, benefits, rights or entitlements during such
period (the "Offered Terms"), and following the Closing Date, Parent shall or
shall cause its Affiliate who is employing such Continuing Employee to
maintain the Offered Terms. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in
the foregoing sentence shall prohibit Parent or its Affiliates from reducing
or otherwise modifying any component of compensation or benefits of any
Continuing Employee. Effective as of, and following, the Closing, to
the extent permitted or required by applicable law, Parent or Affiliate will
cause any employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements in which
any Continuing Employee participates that is a health or welfare benefit plan
(collectively, "Parent Welfare Plans") to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, requirements for insurability, exclusions and service
conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents), (ii) honor any
payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximums under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in satisfying any
applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under a
corresponding Parent Welfare Plan during the same plan year in which such
payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii) with respect to any
medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee
following the Closing. No Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall be
entitled to assert any claim hereunder and nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as limiting the power of the Parent or its Affiliates to amend or
terminate any particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy,
or interpreted as requiring the Company or Parent or any of their Affiliates
to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period of time.

 



65 6.12 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company and any ERISA Affiliate
shall terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation
plans, programs or arrangements and any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan")
(unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans
shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the
Company, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plans
have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the board of
directors of the Company or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval
of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require. In
the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then such
charges and/or fees shall be included in Third Party Expenses and shall be
the responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) _Termination of PEO Arrangement_. The Company shall terminate
its services agreement with TriNet, Inc. (the "PEO Arrangement"), effective

Company evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the PEO Arrangement
has been timely and properly terminated in accordance with this Section
6.12(b), pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company and
any other appropriate entity. Any termination fee or similar expense resulting
from the termination of the PEO Arrangement shall be borne solely by the
Company and no such fee or expense shall be borne by Company Employees or by
Parent.

6.13 _Agreements and Documents Delivered at Signing or Immediately
Following Signing_. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,

Agreement, as the case may be, to remain in full force and effect through the
Closing Date.

together with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice to the
IRS on behalf of the Company after the Closing.

 

6.16 _Tax Matters_.

expense of the Company, for the preparation and filing of any Return of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is required to be filed on or before the

executed notice addressed to each such Tax Service Provider permitting such
Tax Service Provider to disclose to Parent and its agents confidential
information relating to the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
covenants set forth in this Section 6.15 shall survive the Closing and the

deliver to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
executed payoff letters or final invoices, as applicable, from each lender,

(whether or not then due and payable), in each case (i) that sets forth the
amount to be paid on or prior to the Closing Date, together with wire transfer
instructions, (ii) evidencing that the payment of such amount would result in
the full repayment, satisfaction, release, and discharge of all current and
future obligations of the Company (and, in the case of hedging, swap or
similar agreements, the complete unwind and settlement of such arrangements)
in respect of such item (except obligations for indemnification and
reimbursement that expressly survive repayment in full) and of all current and
future Liens relating to such item and (iii) contemplating the delivery of
UCC-3 termination statements and mortgage releases that when filed or
recorded, as the case may be, will be sufficient to release any and all Liens
relating to such item.

efforts to cause the Joinder Agreements to be executed on or prior to the

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving
effect to the conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock into shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time).

 

6.22 _Commercial Agreement between Company and Parent_. Parent confirms and
agrees that from the Agreement Date until the earlier of the Effective Time
or the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX Parent shall

dollar ($3,000,000) aggregate credit limit with the Company established in

"Required Minimum Weekly Cash Payment" on a timely basis, in each case for
each weekly period listed in Schedule 6.22 commencing upon the Agreement Date.
The Company shall provide written notice to

 



68  Parent of any breach by Parent of the foregoing covenant and shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to cure such breach within two (2) Business Days of
such notice being delivered to Parent. In the event that Parent does not cure
such breach within such two (2) Business Day period and the Company is
required to draw down amounts under its WF Line of Credit as a direct
consequence of such breach (such amounts, the "Credit Line Advance Amount"),
the parties agree that the amount of the Credit Line Advance Amount so drawn
in accordance with this Section 6.22 (which may, for the avoidance of doubt,
be less than the aggregate amounts drawn down by the Company under its WF
Line of Credit) shall not constitute, or be included in the calculation of,
Closing Indebtedness for the purposes of Section 2.9(a)(i) hereof and shall
not be deducted in the calculation of the Base Merger Consideration.

6.23 _Indemnification of Company Officers and Directors_.

Company set forth in Schedule 6.23(a) (the "Company Indemnitees"), including
any provisions existing in the Articles of Incorporation or the bylaws of the
Company as of the Agreement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of Parent, the Interim Surviving Entity and the Final Surviving
Entity or their successors (i) shall be subject to any limitation imposed by
applicable Law and (ii) shall not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee
who is also an officer or director of the Company from his or her obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall such Company Indemnitee have any right
of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from Parent, the
Interim Surviving Entity or the Final Surviving Entity or their successors
with respect with any Loss claimed by any of the Indemnified Parties against
such Company Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Company Shareholder
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent shall
have no obligation to maintain the existence of the Interim Surviving Entity
or the Final Surviving Entity for any specified period following the Effective
Time and (ii) this Section 6.23(a) is intended to benefit each Person who was

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a quote for the
purchase of a prepaid directors and officers liability policy or policies
(the "Tail Policy") that will remain in effect until the six (6) year
anniversary of the Effective Time the material terms of which, including
coverage and amount are comparable to those of the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance policy (copies of which have been
made available to Parent prior to the Agreement Date). At Parents request,
the Company shall purchase such Tail Policy prior to the Closing Date, and
the Company and Parent shall each contribute fifty percent (50%) of any
payments with respect to such Tail Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that to
the extent any payments payable by the Company with respect to such Tail
Policy have not been paid by the Company prior to the Closing, then such
payments shall be deemed Third Party Expenses or Excess Third Party Expenses,
as the case may be.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.23 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnitees (it being expressly
agreed that the Company Indemnitees shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.23). The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.23 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnitee without the express written consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee.

6.24 _Option Bonus Agreement_. The Company shall (a) deliver to each holder
of Vested Company Options with respect to such Company Options, except for
Assumed Options set forth on Schedule 2.7(f)(i) and Vested Company Options
granted in 2013, an option bonus agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, including the terms set forth on Schedule 6.24 (an
"Option Bonus Agreement"); and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain duly executed Option Bonus Agreements from each such holder.

 



69 6.25 _Charter Amendment_. The Company shall promptly submit to the
shareholders of the Company for approval by such shareholders of the Company
as is required by applicable Law, the Charter Documents and any Contracts
between the Company and its shareholders, an amendment to the Articles of
Incorporation in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (the

the requisite shareholder consent with respect to the Charter Amendment.

 

6.26 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the request of another party

Indemnifying Party for Losses in respect of any Indemnifiable Matters under
or pursuant to (A) Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be limited to an amount equal to
such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the property in the Escrow Fund,
for this purpose excluding the Additional Escrow Amount; (B) Section
8.2(a)(ii) through Section 8.2(a)(viii), shall be limited to the portion of
the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration received by such Indemnifying Party or
Parties and (C) Section 8.2(a)(ix) shall be limited to an amount equal to
such Indemnifying Partys or Parties Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund, for
this purpose including the Additional Escrow Amount, in addition to any
related Indemnifiable Matters pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i).

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.4, no Indemnified Party or
Parties shall be entitled to recover any Losses in respect of any
Indemnifiable Matters under or pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Party or Parties
are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $1,000,000
(the "Threshold"), in which case the Indemnified Party or Parties shall be
entitled to the full amount of all such Losses from the first dollar
(including the amount of the Threshold).

(c) In determining the amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII, the gross amount of the
indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually
received by such Indemnified Parties (excluding any costs incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in recovering or seeking to recover any insurance
proceeds and net of any related premium increases), (ii) any indemnification
payments actually received by such Indemnified Parties under Contracts in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any costs
incurred by the Indemnified Parties in recovering or seeking to recover such
payments) and (iii) any amounts accrued, reflected or otherwise taken into
account in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, in each case
related to such Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party
shall have any obligation to seek recovery under any insurance policy or from
any third party Persons if such Indemnified Party reasonably determines in
good faith that recovery would be unlikely.

8.4 _No Indemnification Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement:

 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Company or
Parent for any willful or intentional breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth in this Agreement, any Related Agreements or in any
certificates or other instruments required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement if the First Step Merger is not consummated;

 

(b) (i) any Indemnifying Party or Parties committing, or having Knowledge of,
any fraud or intentional misrepresentation with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall indemnify, and hold the Indemnified
Party or Parties harmless for, any Losses paid, incurred or sustained by the
Indemnified Party or Parties or any of them (including the Company), as a
result of such fraud or intentional misrepresentation; and (ii) none of the
Indemnified Partys or Parties equitable or legal claims arising out of fraud
or intentional misrepresentation shall be limited or waived by this
Article VIII or this Agreement with respect to any Person committing such
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or any Person who has Knowledge of such
fraud or intentional misrepresentation;

 



77 (c) Any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss
under this Article VIII notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party
or Parties had Knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to
such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related
thereto;

 

(d) Nothing shall prohibit Parent from seeking and obtaining recourse against
any Company Securityholder in the event that Parent issues more than the
portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration or Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration to which such Company Securityholder is entitled pursuant to
Article II;

 

(e) If an Indemnified Partys or Parties claim under this Article VIII may be
brought under different sections of Section 8.2(a) then such Indemnified
Party or Parties shall have the right to bring such claim under any applicable
section it chooses in accordance with this Article VIII;

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any party hereto to
apply for equitable remedies to enforce the other party or parties
obligations hereunder; and

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Indemnified Party
or Parties to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the parties
thereto.

8.5 _Indemnification Claims Procedures_.

 

(a) _Making a Claim for Indemnification; Claim Certificate_. If an Indemnified
Party or Parties believes that it has or may acquire a right to
indemnification under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party or Parties may
make an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a) by delivering a
certificate (a "Claim Certificate") to the Shareholder Representative, with a
copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Indemnified Party or
Parties are seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund), and/or to one or more
Indemnifying Party or Parties (if and to the extent that the Indemnified
Party or Parties are seeking recourse directly against any such Indemnifying
Party or Parties), (i) stating that such Indemnified Party or Parties have
paid, sustained or incurred (or reasonably anticipate that they will have
to pay, sustain or incur) Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail,
to the extent known, the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained or incurred, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the
Indemnifiable Matter to which such item is related; _provided, however,_ that
the Claim Certificate need only specify such information to the knowledge of
such Indemnified Party or Parties as of the Claim Date, shall not limit any
of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party or Parties, and may be
updated and amended from time to time by the Indemnified Party or Parties by
delivering an updated or amended Claim Certificate to the Shareholder
Representative or applicable Indemnifying Party or Parties, as the case may
be, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Indemnified
Party or Parties are seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund). The date of
delivery of a Claim Certificate is referred to herein as the "Claim Date" of
such Claim Certificate (and the claims for indemnification set forth therein).

 

(b) _Objecting a Claim for Indemnification; Objection Notice_.

 

(i) Following its receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Shareholder
Representative (or in the case of a claim directly against one or
more Indemnifying Party or Parties, such Indemnifying Party or Parties) may
object to any item(s) or amount(s) set forth therein by delivering written
notice thereof (an "Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Party or Parties
submitting such Claim Certificate at the addresses of such Indemnified Party
or Parties set forth in such Claim Certificate, with a copy to the Escrow
Agent (if and to the extent that the Indemnified Party or Parties are seeking
recourse against the Escrow Fund); _provided_ that to be effective such
Objection Notice must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party or Parties
(and, in the case of a claim for recourse against the Escrow Fund, to the
Escrow Agent) prior to 5:00 p.m. California time on the forty-fifth (45th)
calendar day following the Claim Date of the Claim Certificate (such deadline,
the "Objection Deadline" for such Claim Certificate and the claims for
indemnification set forth therein) and (ii) set forth in reasonable detail the
nature of the objections to the claims in the Claim Certificate in respect of
which the objection is made.

 



78 (ii) If the Shareholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party or Parties,
if indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such Indemnifying
Party or Parties) does not object as provided in Section 8.5(b)(i) to any item
or amount set forth in an Claim Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline
for such Claim Certificate, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgement by the Shareholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party
or Parties, if indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such
Indemnifying Party or Parties) that the Indemnified Party or Parties is
entitled to the full amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Claim
Certificate (and such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably
established) with respect to the Indemnifying Party or Parties against whom
indemnification has been sought (any such claim, an "Unobjected Claim").

(iii) With respect to an Unobjected Claim against the Escrow Fund, promptly
following the Objection Deadline for the Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to any Indemnified
Party or Parties that have previously delivered such Claim Certificate an
amount equal to the amount of Losses set forth in such Unobjected Claim. With
respect to an Unobjected Claim for which the Indemnifying Party or Parties are
directly liable beyond the Escrow Fund hereunder, within thirty (30) days of
a claim becoming an Unobjected Claim, the applicable Indemnifying Party or
Parties shall make the applicable payment to such Indemnified Party or
Parties, subject to Section 8.3, Section 8.4 and Section 8.7.

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(i) In case the Shareholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party or
Parties in the case of a claim for indemnification sought directly from an
Indemnifying Party or Parties) timely delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 8.5(b)(i), the Shareholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party or Parties) and Parent (for itself and on behalf
of any other Indemnified Party) shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties and to resolve objections in the Objection
Notice with respect to each of such claims. Either party may, but shall not be
obligated to, initiate non-binding mediation of the dispute with the
assistance of a neutral arbitrator belonging to and under the rules of the CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution. The party requesting the mediation shall
arrange for mediation services, subject to the approval of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Mediation shall take place in Santa
Clara County, California during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time, but with at
least ten (10) Business Days written notice to all parties. If one party
initiates mediation, the parties (A) shall participate in the mediation in
good faith and shall devote reasonable time and energy to the mediation so as
to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the
dispute and (B) shall not pursue other remedies while such mediation is
proceeding. If the Shareholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying
Parties) and Parent reach an agreement, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent and, in
the case of a claim directly against the Indemnifying Parties, to the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof.

 

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation (and, if
applicable, mediation) prior to ninety (90) days following the date an
Objection Notice is deemed properly delivered, given and received pursuant to
Section 10.1, either Parent or the Shareholder Representative (or the
objecting Indemnifying Party or Parties) may bring suit in the courts
identified in Section 10.8 to resolve the matter. The decision of the trial
court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate
shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance
with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall distribute the amounts from the
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

 



79 8.6 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party or Parties
become aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which such
Indemnified Party or Parties in good faith believes may result in an
Indemnification Claim, such Indemnified Party or Parties shall as promptly as
practicable notify the Shareholder Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party
or Parties, such Indemnifying Party or Parties) of such claim. The Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or
Parties (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly
from an Indemnifying Party or Parties, such Indemnifying Party or Parties
shall be entitled), at its or their expense, to participate in, but not to
determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim or settlement
negotiations with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Shareholder
Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings,
notices and communications with respect to the Third Party Claim to the
extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating
to any Indemnified Party and Parent shall keep the Shareholder Representative
reasonably informed and updated as to the status of the Third Party Claim at
all times pending resolution thereof. The failure to so notify the Shareholder
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party or Parties, such Indemnifying Party or
Parties) of the commencement of any such Claim will relieve the Indemnifying
Parties from liability in connection therewith only if and to the extent that
such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying
Parties to defend their interests in such Claim. The Indemnified Party or
Parties shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of,
and to settle, any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with the
consent of the Shareholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification
is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party or Parties, such
Indemnifying Party or Parties), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim
shall be determinative of (i) the amount of Losses relating to such matter,
or (ii) unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by the Shareholder
Representative, the existence of an Indemnifiable Matter. In the event that
the Shareholder Representative has consented to any such settlement with
respect to an Indemnification Claim under Section 8.2(a), the Indemnifying
Party or Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VIII to the amount of any Third Party Claim by the
Indemnified Party or Parties against the Escrow Fund or against the
Indemnifying Party or Parties directly, as the case may be, with respect to
such settlement. In the event that the Shareholder Representative has
not consented to any such settlement or indicates that it will not consent to
such settlement, in each case within five (5) Business Days following the date
the Shareholder Representative was provided notice of the settlement, the
Shareholder Representative shall give the Indemnified Parties written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the objections to such
settlement (a "Settlement Objection") by the end of such five (5) Business Day
period. Unless Parent believes that Parent or any of the Indemnified Parties
would be materially prejudiced by the failure to settle within thirty (30)
days, in which case Parent shall notify the Shareholder Representative and
attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes with the Shareholder
Representative regarding the Settlement Objection prior to the failure to
settle such Third Party Claim becoming materially prejudicial, the Indemnified
Parties shall not enter into any settlement with respect to the relevant
matter for a period of thirty (30) days from the date that the Shareholder
Representative delivers the Settlement Objection to the Indemnified Party or
Parties (the "Stand-down Period"), and during the Stand-down Period, the
Shareholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties shall discuss the terms
of such settlement in good faith and shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties and to resolve the objections in
the Settlement Objection with respect to such settlement.

8.7 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
Indemnified Party or Parties under Section 8.2(a), at the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any act
of the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with Section 2.10(a) such deposit of
the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow fund to be governed by the terms
set forth herein. The Escrow Amount (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") shall be
available to compensate the Indemnified Party or Parties for any claims by
such parties for any Losses paid, incurred or sustained by them and for which
they are entitled to recovery under this Article VIII. The Escrow Agent may
execute this Agreement following the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing,
and such later execution, if so executed after the Agreement Date, shall not
affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the Agreement Date between
the other signatories hereto.

 



80 (b) _Distribution of Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
11:59 p.m., California time, on the date that is eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period").

 

(ii) On the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent and
the Shareholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A)
retain in the Escrow Fund an amount of Parent Common Stock (valued at the
Closing Price) or cash, if applicable, equal to the Subsequent Escrow Amount,
which Subsequent Escrow Amount shall remain a part of the Escrow Fund and (B)
distribute any Parent Common Stock or cash, as the case may be, remaining in
the Escrow Fund (after setting aside an amount of Parent Common Stock (valued
at the Closing Price) or cash, as the case may be, equal to the Subsequent
Escrow Amount) to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with such
Indemnifying Parties respective Pro-Rata Portions.

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days following the expiration of the Escrow
Period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to distribute any Parent Common Stock or cash, as the case may
be, remaining in the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance
with their respective Pro-Rata Portions following such termination as provided
in Section 8.7(b)(v); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not
terminate, and the Escrow Agent shall not disburse any shares of Parent
Common Stock or cash, as the case may be, from the Escrow Fund with respect to
any amount in respect of any unsatisfied claims specified in any Claim
Certificate in accordance with Section 8.2 ("Unresolved Claims") delivered
prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and
circumstances existing prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period, and any
such amount shall not be distributed to the Indemnifying Party or Parties at
such time and shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such Unresolved Claims
have been resolved or satisfied pursuant to this Article VIII.

 

(iv) Promptly following such time as all claims for indemnification for
Indemnification Matters under Section 8.2(a)(ix) have been fully resolved,
Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to the Indemnifying Parties an amount equal to the
Additional Escrow Amount minus the amount of all Losses of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to Indemnification Matters under Section
8.2(a)(ix). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Additional Escrow Amount
may be distributed to the Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund only in
connection with any Losses paid, incurred or sustained by the Indemnified
Party or Parties, or any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of,
arising out of or in connection with Indemnifiable Matters under Section
8.2(a)(ix) and (B) the existence, availability or unavailability of the
Additional Escrow Amount as part of the Escrow Fund shall not impair or alter
Parents ability to seek recourse to the remainder of the Escrow Fund in
connection with such Indemnifiable Matters under Section 8.2(a)(ix) or
otherwise.

(v) As soon as all such claims have been resolved, Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver
the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, not required to satisfy such
Unresolved Claims, (A) first, to the Shareholder Representative for any
Shareholder Representative Expenses, and (B) second, to the Indemnifying
Party or Parties. Deliveries of shares of Parent Common Stock or cash out of
the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Party or Parties pursuant to this Section
8.7 shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund, with the amount delivered to each
Company Securityholder rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) (with
amounts 0.005 and above rounded up), in respect of cash and rounded down, to
the nearest share, in respect of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any property in the Escrow Fund deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement to any former holder of Company Capital Stock such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law or under any applicable legal
requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



81 (vi) For purposes of this Agreement, if the Escrow Fund consists of (A) shares
of Parent Common Stock, the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund to be returned to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any
indemnifiable Losses, if any, shall equal the applicable amount of the Losses
divided by the Closing Price and (B) cash, the amount of cash in the Escrow
Fund to be returned to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any indemnifiable
Losses, if any, shall equal the applicable amount of the Losses.

 

(c) _Sale of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund and Expense Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) Within seven (7) days following the Closing Date, the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent written notice that it, on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties, has elected to either (A) direct the Escrow Agent to
cause to be sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund,
with the net sale price of such sale being contributed directly to the
Escrow Fund, or (B) hold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund until the release of the Escrow Fund in accordance with this
Section 8.7. The Shareholder Representative hereby notifies Parent that
immediately after the Closing it shall direct the Escrow Agent to cause to be
sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Expense Escrow Fund, with
the net sale price of such sale being contributed directly to the Expense
Escrow Fund.

 

(ii) In the event that the Shareholder Representative notifies Parent that the
Shareholder Representative is making the election described in Section
8.7(c)(i)(A) above, then within seven (7) days following the Closing Date, the
Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit J (an "Escrow Sale
Instruction Letter") that the Shareholder Representative has elected to direct
the Escrow Agent to cause to be sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Escrow Fund. As part of the same Escrow Sale Instruction Letter with
respect to such sale of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund, or
pursuant to a separate Escrow Sale Instruction Letter which the Shareholder
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent within seven (7) days
following the Closing Date, the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to sell all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Expense
Escrow Fund.

 

(iii) If Parent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall not receive notice
from the Shareholder Representative delivered pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 8.7(c)(i) or Section 8.7(c)(ii), as applicable, within the time
period set forth therein, then the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of
itself and the Indemnifying Parties) shall have irrevocably waived its right
to cause to be sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow
Fund and/or the Expense Escrow Fund prior to the disbursement of such shares
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

(iv) If the Shareholder Representative notifies Parent of its election to
cause to be sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund
in accordance with Section 8.7(c)(i) and delivers an Escrow Sale Instruction
Letter to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8.7(c)(ii) within the time
period set forth therein, the Escrow Agent shall cause all of the shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund and in the Expense Escrow Fund to be
sold as promptly as practicable, with the net sales price realized from such
sale (but no additional consideration) being contributed directly to the
Escrow Fund, or the Expense Escrow Fund, as applicable.

(v) In the event that any shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund or
Expense Escrow Fund are sold at a price below the Closing Price, in
compliance with this Section 8.7(c): (A) neither the Shareholder
Representative nor any of the Indemnifying Parties shall have any liability to
any Indemnified Party or to the Indemnifying Parties as a result of such sale
below the Closing Price, and (B) neither Parent, Escrow Agent or any
Indemnified Party shall have any liability to any Indemnifying Party or
Indemnifying Parties as a result of such sale below the Closing Price.

 



82 (d) _Protection of Escrow Fund and Expense Escrow Fund_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund and the Expense
Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such funds as trust funds
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of
(A) the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and
Section 2.10 and (B) the Expense Escrow Fund only in accordance with the
terms of Section 8.8.

(ii) If the Escrow Fund or Expense Escrow Fund includes cash, such cash shall
be invested in U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of not more than ninety
(90) days and any interest paid on such cash shall be added to the Escrow Fund
or Expense Escrow Fund, as the case may be, and become a part thereof. For any
period of time before such U.S. Treasury bills can be purchased by the Escrow
Agent or after such bills mature, the cash, if any, in the Escrow Fund and/or
the Expense Escrow Fund, if any, shall be invested in a U.S. Bank money market
deposit account, as fully described on the attached Exhibit K and any
interest paid on such cash shall be added to the Escrow Fund and/or the
Expense Escrow Fund, as the case may be, and become a part thereof and
available for satisfaction of claims, in the case of the Escrow Fund, and
available for satisfaction of Shareholder Representative Expenses, in the case
of the Expense Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any
investment losses including without any limitation any market loss for any
investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a payment required
hereunder. Should the Escrow Agent be directed by the Shareholder
Representative under Section 8.7(c) to sell shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Escrow Fund and the Expense Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
protected in acting upon such instructions provided by the Shareholder
Representative in executing such trade(s). The Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for any loss in the event that any shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Escrow Fund are sold at a price below
the Closing Price.

(e)  _Tax Reporting_.

(i) For all U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax reporting and
withholding purposes the Indemnifying Parties shall not be treated as having
received or contributed any portion of the Escrow Amount, or as owners of any
portion of the Escrow Amount, including any interest or other income or gains
from investment of the Escrow Amount, until it is released and distributed to
them. Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund for tax purposes
and shall report any income earned by the Escrow Fund, until the Escrow Fund,
if any, is distributed to the Indemnifying Parties. Any amounts released to
the Indemnifying Parties from the Escrow Fund shall be (A) treated as
additional consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) composed of
an interest element and a principal element, the interest element to
be computed and reported in accordance with the imputed interest rules of the
Code and which Parent shall provide to the Escrow Agent prior to each
distribution from the Escrow Fund. Each of Parent and, prior to the Closing,
the Company and, after the Closing, the Shareholder Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Indemnifying Party to provide to
the Escrow Agent any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, (which must be originally
executed) or any similar form requested by the Escrow Agent; _provided_ , that
the Escrow Agent shall rely upon (and obtain copies from Parent as necessary,
to the extent Parent has received such forms prior to the Closing) all tax
forms used and collected by Parent in connection with Closing payments
pursuant to Section 2.10(c)(ii).

 

(ii) The Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the
absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law, and shall remit
such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Company hereby represent and
warrants to the Escrow Agent that (A) there is no sale or transfer of an
United States Real Property Interest as defined under IRC Section 897(c)
in the underlying transaction giving rise to this Agreement; and (B), except
as provided in the Spreadsheet, no Indemnifying Party is subject to
withholding on payments made in connection with the Merger, other than backup
withholding on failure to provide any required tax documentation. The
Indemnifying Parties agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless
from any liability or obligation on account of taxes, assessments, additions
for late payment, interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental
charges that may be assessed or asserted against the Escrow Agent in
connection with or relating to any payment made or other activities performed
under the terms of this

 



83  Agreement, including without limitation any liability for the withholding or
deduction of (or the failure to withhold or deduct) the same, and any
liability for failure to obtain proper certifications or to report properly
to governmental authorities in connection with this Agreement, including costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), interest and
penalties, except to the extent such amounts relate to the Escrow Agents
fraud or gross negligence, failure to withhold, or failure to perform any
backup withholding. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold
harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

(iii) Parent shall make an affirmative communication to the Escrow Agent if
the securities being exchanged, redeemed, or sold are classified as "Covered
Securities" under the Internal Revenue Service Cost Basis Reporting
regulations.

(iv) If such securities are classified as "Covered Securities," Parent is
responsible for providing the required information to the Escrow Agent for
sending accurate and complete Form 1099-B information to the Company
Securityholders. The required information shall be each Company Shareholders
date of acquisition and each Company Shareholders cost basis of the
applicable security, and any such other information that the Escrow Agent may
request to be in compliance with the IRS 1099-B reporting regulations under
the Internal Revenue Code. The information shall be provided timely to Escrow
Agent so it can meet its obligations to send Form 1099-B information to the
applicable Company Shareholders and the IRS by the applicable
reporting deadlines.

(v) The parties acknowledge that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest
attributable to the Expense Escrow Amount, and interest thereon, held in the
Expense Escrow Fund shall be allocable to the Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with each Holders respective Pro Rata Share of the Expense Escrow
Fund.

 

(f) _Escrow Agent s Duties_.

 

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in
any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the Agreement Date which are signed by an officer of Parent, and may
rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith.

(ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, awards of
arbitrators and written instructions of Parent. In case the Escrow Agent obeys
or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, award of
arbitrator or instructions, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of
the parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or award being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been
entered without jurisdiction.

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

 

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

 



84 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except as a result of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith
believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal
counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this
Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.
The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the
authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to
this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy
or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents
and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by
final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for
damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the
clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow, except
all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader
Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: 50% to be paid by
Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of the
Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portions;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event any Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay his or her Pro
Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent
may at its option pay such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Agent
Interpleader Expenses and recover an amount equal from such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such action, the
Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

(vii) Parent and the Indemnifying Parties and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including
allocated costs of in house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on
Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
his/her duties under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from
this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent
Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be
paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of each Indemnifying Partys
respective Pro Rata Portions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any
Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the
Agent Indemnification Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Agent
Indemnification Expenses and recover an amount equal from such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.

 

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty
(30) days written notice to Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow
agent by Parent, subject to the consent of the Shareholder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment, and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and
liability under this Agreement.

 



85 (g) _Fees_. The Company and Parent shall each contribute fifty percent (50%)
of all fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder in
accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent any such fees payable by the Company have not
been paid by the Company prior to with the Closing, then such fees shall be
deemed Third Party Expenses or Excess Third Party Expenses, as the case may
be. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services
of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this
Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any
service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an
officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the
terms of this Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent
is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow
Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated
for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in house counsel, and expenses occasioned
by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.

__(h) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent
in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act. __

 

8.8 _Shareholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the First Step Merger and this Agreement by
the Indemnifying Parties, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to
have agreed to appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its agent
and attorney-in-fact, as the Shareholder Representative with full power and
authority to act for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and
receive notices and communications, to direct the Escrow Agent to cause to be
sold all of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund and the
Expense Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.7(c), to authorize payment to
any Indemnified Party or Parties from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by such Indemnified Party or Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a), to
object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and request mediation as provided in this Agreement and
comply with orders of courts and awards of mediators with respect to such
claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
request mediation and comply with orders of courts and awards of mediators
with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party or Parties against
any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party or Parties or any dispute between any Indemnified Party or
Parties and any such Indemnifying Party, to authorize the sale of all of the
shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund and deliver an Escrow Sale
Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8.7(c)(i), and to
execute all such documents necessary or appropriate in the sole opinion of the
Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. The
Shareholder Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed
by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Shareholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Shareholder Representative may be filled by the vote of holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder
Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying
Parties.

 

(b) The Expense Escrow Amount (collectively, with any interest accrued
thereon, the "Expense Escrow Fund") shall be available to pay directly, or
reimburse the Shareholder Representative for,

 



86  Shareholder Representative Expenses (as defined in Section 8.8(c) below)
that are incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Shareholder Representative and that arise out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Shareholder Representatives duties
hereunder. From time to time prior to the end of the Escrow Period, the
Shareholder Representative may deliver a written certificate (a "Shareholder
Representative Certificate"), signed by the Shareholder Representative, to the
Escrow Agent (A) stating that the Shareholder Representative is entitled to be
paid, or to be reimbursed, from amounts then available in the Expense Escrow
Fund the aggregate amount of the Shareholder Representative Expenses incurred
by the Shareholder Representative that are set forth in the Shareholder
Representative Certificate, and (B) certifying that all such Shareholder
Representative Expenses set forth in such Shareholder Representative
Certificate were reasonably and actually incurred by the Shareholder
Representative in connection with the administration of its duties and the
fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Shareholder
Representative Certificate delivered by the Shareholder Representative to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 8.8(b) shall contain a reasonably
detailed description of all Shareholder Representative Expenses for which
payment or reimbursement is sought by the Shareholder Representative. The
Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for making any assessments of any
Shareholder Representative Certificate and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon its contents. Provided the Shareholder Representative
Certificate delivered by the Shareholder Representative complies with the
requirements set out in this Section 8.8(b), the Escrow Agent shall promptly
distribute to or as directed by the Shareholder Representative, to the extent
such amount is then available in the Expense Escrow Fund, the aggregate amount
of the Shareholder Representative Expenses set forth in such
Shareholder Representative Certificate.

(c) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties
shall indemnify the Shareholder Representative and hold the Shareholder
Representative harmless against any losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs or expenses (including the
fees and expenses of counsel and experts and all expenses with respect to
document location, duplication and shipment) arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder Representatives
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Shareholder Representative
(collectively, "Shareholder Representative Expenses"), in each case as such
Shareholder Representative Expense is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Shareholder Representative Expense is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder
Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such
indemnified Shareholder Representative Expenses to the extent attributable to
such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Shareholder Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such
Shareholder Representative Expenses shall be recovered by the Shareholder
Representative from (i) funds in the Expense Escrow Fund and (ii) to the
extent the funds in the Expense Escrow Fund are insufficient, if then
available after satisfaction of all claims of an Indemnified Party or Parties,
the amounts in the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution thereof to the
Indemnifying Parties; provided, that while this section allows the Shareholder
Representative to be paid from the Expense Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund,
this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to
promptly pay such Shareholder Representative Expenses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholder Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Shareholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge
and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation
or removal of the Shareholder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, shall constitute a decision of the
Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties.
The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative.

 



87 (d) After the completion of the Shareholder Representatives responsibilities,
the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute
any cash remaining in the Expense Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with such Indemnifying Parties respective Pro Rata Portions of the
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund, with the amount delivered to each
Indemnifying Party rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) (with amounts
0.005 and above rounded up).

venue of any court within San Francisco County, State of California, in

matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California for such persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Subject to
the terms of Section 8.5, each party agrees not to commence any legal
proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

10.8  _Dispute Resolution_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Section 10.8, the parties hereto agree that any legal proceeding by or against
any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of this Agreement shall
be brought exclusively in any federal court in the U.S. District for the
Northern District of California. By execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes arising under the this Agreement and not as a general
submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter
or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the
address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such
service of process shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
law. The parties hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any
action or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought
before the foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason, or that it or any of its property is immune from the above-described
legal process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any
other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of
any amount to which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final
judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

 

10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
_WAIVES_ ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR

 



91  COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.10 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person such
as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow
Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a
legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant
documentation. The parties hereto each agree to provide all such information
and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure
compliance with federal law.

 

10.11 _Security Procedures_.

 

(a) Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall each deliver to Escrow
Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate naming the officers who have
the authority to execute and amend this Agreement. Exhibit L names the
authorized representatives who are authorized to provide disbursement
instructions with respect to the Escrow Funds, and Escrow Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer or
authorized representative. In the event funds transfer instructions are given,
whether in writing or by facsimile, Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to one or more of
the person or persons designated in Schedule 10.11 who is different from the
person who gave the transfer instruction, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated.
The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a
writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent. If Escrow Agent is
unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified, Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to any one or more of Parents or the Shareholder
Representatives (as applicable) authorized officers as prescribed
on Purchasers banking resolutions which shall include the titles of
treasurer or assistant treasurer for Parent. Escrow Agent and the
beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer to Parent may rely solely upon any
account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Parent to identify
(i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank, or (iii) an intermediary
bank. Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Fund for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number in a manner consistent with the
written instructions from (i) Parent, to the extent that it relates to
payments to Parent and/or (ii) the Shareholder Representative, to the extent
that it relates to payments to the Shareholder Representative or the
Indemnifying Parties. Parent and the Shareholder Representative each
acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this Section are
