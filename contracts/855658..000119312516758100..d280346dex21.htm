Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Canyon Bridge Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "
and, collectively with the Company and Parent, the " _Parties_ ").

 

RECITALS

A. The Parties intend to effect a merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub
with and into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ ").

B. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (1) determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (2) adopted resolutions
approving and declaring the advisability of this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (3) resolved to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement on the terms and

delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and Parent, its
sole stockholder, (2) adopted resolutions approving and declaring the
advisability of this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby, and (3) resolved to recommend that Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement on the terms and subject to

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Canyon

G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, Parent, the Company and the Escrow Agent have executed and
delivered an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant to which
Parent has deposited an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee with the
Escrow Agent. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein and intending to
be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the
Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

Section 1.02 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE VII, the closing
(the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger (a) will take place at 12:00 p.m., Pacific
Time, at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto,
California, as soon as practicable (but in no event later than five Business
Days after all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than
conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the Party entitled to
the benefit of the same, or (b) will occur at such other place, time and date
as will be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent (the date upon
which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the Company will file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree
upon and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.04 _Effect_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will
be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter will, by virtue of or in
connection with the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended, will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



2 (b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
the Company and Merger Sub, the Company Bylaws will be amended and restated
in their entirety to be the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation will be "Lattice Semiconductor Corporation" and, as so amended,
will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be. Unless Parent, in its sole
discretion, determines otherwise, the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_ . At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holders of
any Shares or shares of common stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") that is held by the Company as treasury stock
and each Share that is owned by a Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")
will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will
cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) will be converted into the right to receive $8.30 in cash (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All such Shares, when so converted, will no longer
be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares (" _Certificates_ ") and each holder of
such Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are not
represented by Certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, to be paid, without interest, in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.02(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
Section 2.02(h)). As and to the extent provided in Section 2.06, the right of
any holder of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration will be subject to
and reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax Law.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
shares of common stock of Merger Sub will be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. 

 



3 Section 2.02 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Shares_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
U.S.-based bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares
for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) in
accordance with Section 6.14, Parent and the Company will cause the Escrow
Agent to release all funds held in the Escrow Account to the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Shares, and (ii) Parent will deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, cash in an amount sufficient, after taking into account the amount
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i), to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be delivered pursuant to Section
2.01(b). All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent (including cash from
the Escrow Fund deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 6.14) is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ". Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section
2.02(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as
described in Section 2.03 shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand; _provided_ that the Parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under
this Section 2.02 or otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to
pay Merger Consideration with respect to Shares as to which its holder has
purported to deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been
withdrawn prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b): (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (including a provision confirming that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holders Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in accordance
with the Paying Agents customary procedures with respect to securities
represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Paying Agent or Parent, the holder of such Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange for such properly surrendered Shares an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and (ii) the
Merger Consideration. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax is not applicable.

 



4 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Share represented by a Certificate
and each Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares)
shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Article II, without any interest thereon, and subject to deduction for any
required deduction for withholding Taxes pursuant to Section 2.06. All cash
paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject
to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other income received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Shares after the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date will be delivered to Parent and any holder of Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to Tax or other applicable Law.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which
the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g)  _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund will be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
investments shall be in (i) short-term obligations of the United States (or
any instrumentality or agency thereof) with maturities of no more than 30
days or guaranteed by the United States (or any instrumentality or agency
thereof) and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, (ii)
commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, with maturities
of no more than six months, or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$2.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available) with maturities of no more than six months. No
gain or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Shares
following completion of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all
interest and other income earned on the Payment Fund will promptly be paid to
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent. No investment of

 



5  the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from promptly
making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses from
any such investment that diminishes the Payment Fund below the level required
for the Paying Agent to make the payments required to be made by it pursuant
to this Article II, Parent shall promptly provide or cause to be provided
additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Companys
stockholders at the Effective Time in the amount necessary to ensure the
Payment Fund is sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the payments
contemplated to be made by it pursuant to this Article II, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

(h) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration, except that Parent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
to deliver a bond in such customary amount as it may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.03 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL.
Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably
lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.01(b). The Company will notify Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other written instruments received by the
Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent will have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer
to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 2.04  _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) _Vested In-the-Money Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to
purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any
Company Stock Plan with an exercise price per Share less than the Merger
Consideration (an " _In-the-Money Company Stock Option_ ") that is vested
(after taking into account (i) the measurement of any corporate performance
goals that are required to be measured at or prior to the Effective Time under
the terms of such outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Options as set forth
in Section 2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (ii) any accelerated
vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the
terms of such outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock

 



6  Option) and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such vested
outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Options, the " _Vested Company Options_
") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder of
such Vested Company Option, be canceled and converted into the right of such
holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Share of such Vested Company Option and (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Vested Company Option.

 

(b) _Unvested In-the-Money Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Option that is not a Vested Company
Option shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
of such In-the-Money Company Stock Option, be canceled and converted into the
right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in
cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding
Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Share of such unvested and outstanding In-the-
Money Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
unvested and outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Option, which cash amount
will be payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in accordance with
the vesting schedule applicable to such unvested In-the-Money Company Stock
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c)  _Other Company Stock Options_. All Company Stock Options which are not
In-the-Money Company Stock Options and any other Company Stock Options that
are not granted under any Company Stock Plan shall be canceled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for no consideration.

(d) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock
units (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") granted under any Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding and unvested (after taking into account any accelerated vesting
that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the
terms of such Company RSU) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such unvested Company RSU, an " _Unvested RSU_ ") shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of any holder of such Unvested RSU, be canceled
and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an
amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)
the number of Shares that remain subject to such Unvested RSU, which cash
amount will vest and become payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to
and in accordance with the vesting schedule and issuance or delivery schedule
applicable to such Unvested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each Company RSU granted under a Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding and vested (after taking into account any accelerated vesting that
is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of
such Company RSU) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such vested
Company RSU, a " _Vested RSU_ ") shall, automatically and without any action
on the part of any holder of such Vested RSU, be canceled and converted into
the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares
that remain subject to such Vested RSU, which cash amount will become payable
by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in accordance with the issuance or
delivery schedule applicable to such Vested RSU as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 



7 (e) _Payments_. To the extent necessary, Parent shall provide to
the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the obligations (i)
under Section 2.04(a) no later than the Effective Time and (ii) under Section
2.04(b) and Section 2.04(d) on or as soon as reasonably practicable following
the applicable vesting or issuance or delivery date. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay or cause to be paid any amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) as soon as administratively practicable, but no later than
ten Business Days, following the Effective Time. All payments in respect of
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs will be treated as a right to receive a
series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such payment will be
considered a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Section 409A of
the Code (including for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)). All payments in respect of Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, only be due and
payable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A)
or in a manner exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in
reliance upon Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

(f) _Treatment of Company Stock Plans; Other Corporate Actions_. The Company
Board or a committee thereof shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are reasonably necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plans, effective
as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be required to issue
Shares or other share capital of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to
any Person pursuant to or in settlement of a Company Stock Option or Company
RSU. Without liming the foregoing, the Company agrees to take any and all
actions necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.04, including making any determinations or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof.

Section 2.05 _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the
Companys 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), (a) no new
offering period will commence after the date of this Agreement and, to the
extent not already provided for under the terms of the ESPP as of the date of
this Agreement, no Company Employees or other persons will be permitted to
begin participating in the ESPP, and no participants will be permitted to
increase elective deferrals in respect of the current offering period
under the ESPP, in each case after the date of this Agreement, (b) any
offering period under the ESPP that is in effect immediately prior to the date
of this Agreement will terminate no later than five days prior to the
Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be
used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and (c) such
Shares will be treated as other outstanding Shares in accordance with Section
2.01(b) of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each fractional Share
held by any participant under the ESPP (if any) will be canceled and
extinguished at the Effective Time, and be converted into the right to receive
a commensurate fractional portion of the Merger Consideration, without
interest, payable to the holder of each such fractional Share.

Section 2.06 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amount otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Law related to Taxes. If the Paying Agent, the
Surviving

 



8  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and remits
such amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.07 _Adjustments_. The Merger Consideration will be automatically
adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Shares), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Shares occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
2.07 will be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or
enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

or Company Bylaws is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and performance by the Company of the provisions hereof will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or

obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien in or upon any of the properties, assets or rights of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under, or give rise to any increased, additional,

Company Material Adverse Effect.

and those filed by the Company with the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, if any, including any amendments thereof, being collectively
referred to as the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). Each Company SEC Document (i)
at the time filed, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the

Documents (i) complied at the time it was filed in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with (A) the

which would not be material, and the absence of notes that, if presented,
would not differ materially from those presented in the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents). The Company is,

in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of October 1, 2016, and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the quarter ended October 1,
2016.

Letter has not been modified, amended or altered. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, to the extent the consent of the Company may be
required by Section 6.03(a), the Equity Commitment Letter will not be amended
or modified without the prior written consent of the Company. The Equity
Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated.

 



34 (b) Except as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, there are
no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Equity Investor to provide
the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Equity Investor to
reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth Section 7.01 and Section 7.02, as of the date of this
Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or
that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.

(c) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and
Section 7.02, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter, together with the cash of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, will provide Parent with cash on the Closing Date sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and
the Financing, in each case on the Closing Date.

 

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any
Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article III (as qualified by the Company
Disclosure Letter), neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates nor any
other Person on behalf of the Company makes any express or implied
representation or warranty (and there is and has been no reliance by Parent or
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives on any such
representation or warranty) with respect to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or their respective businesses or with respect to any other
information provided, or made available, to Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereunder, including the accuracy or
completeness thereof. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees
that neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
Liability or other obligation to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person resulting
from Parents or Merger Subs or their respective Representatives or
Affiliates use of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, including any information made available in the
electronic data room maintained by the Company for purposes of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereunder, teasers, marketing materials,
consulting reports or materials, confidential information memoranda,
management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, responses to
questions submitted on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives or in any other form in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereunder, unless and to the extent any such
information is included in a representation or warranty contained in Article
III (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Letter).

the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under

the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal or (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making

a Takeover Proposal or an inquiry, proposal or request for information that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, contact the Person

or request constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to, or result in, a
Superior Proposal, and to inform such Person of the provisions of this Section
5.02.

 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent,
in writing, in the event the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective Representatives receives (i) a Takeover Proposal or an inquiry,
proposal or request for information that is reasonably expected to lead to,
or result in, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) a request to engage in discussions or

Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request and 

 



41  a copy of such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request (or, where

written description of the Companys understanding of the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request), including
any modifications thereto. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably

promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal in accordance with Section 5.02(b)
and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

(d) Except as expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 5.02, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i)(A) withdraw, modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Company Board
Recommendation or the approval or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover
Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, or propose publicly to adopt, or
allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or
similar document or any other Contract relating to any Takeover Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.02(d) to the contrary, but subject
to Section 5.02(g), if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval an Intervening Event occurs or arises, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(d) to the
contrary, but subject to Section 5.02(g), at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval if (i) the Company receives from a third party a
Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (ii) a material breach by
the Company of this Section 5.02 has not led to the making of such Takeover
Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that (A) such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all
of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by
Parent and (B) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company Board may effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(c)(ii) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal.

 



42 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(f) unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, or Intervening Event,
as the case may be, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, (A) in
the case of any action being taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of any proposed definitive
Contract(s) with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (B) in the case of any action being taken in
connection with an Intervening Event, the facts underlying the Company Boards
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale and
basis for making an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such
Intervening Event;

(ii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or to
obviate the basis for an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(iii) following any negotiation described in Section 5.02(g)(ii), the Company
Board determines, after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent, that (A) in the case of
any action being taken in connection with a Takeover Proposal, such Takeover
Proposal (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent) continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law or (B) in the case of any
action being taken in connection with an Intervening Event, the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

The Parties agree that for purposes of calculating the Notice Period, (A) the
first Business Day will be the first Business Day after the date Parent has
received notice from the Company, (B) the fourth Business Day will end at 5:00
pm, Pacific time, on such date, and (C) in the event of any material
revisions to the terms of a Takeover Proposal after the start of a Notice
Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.02(g) with
respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to
have re-commenced on the date of such new notice except that in the event of
any such material revisions the Notice Period shall end at 5:00 pm, Pacific
time, on the later of (1) the date the Notice Period was originally scheduled
to expire and (2) the second Business Day following the delivery of the notice
setting forth such material revisions.

 



43 (h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 will prohibit the Company
Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will
the Company Board make an Adverse Recommendation Change except as permitted by
Section 5.02(f).

 

(i) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.02 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to be a breach
of this Agreement by the Company.

for the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company shall
consult with Parent in good faith regarding the foregoing. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the filing thereof. The Company shall obtain and furnish
the information required to be included in the Proxy Statement, shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub with any comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff with respect thereto, shall respond as promptly as practicable to
any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement, and shall cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders at the earliest practicable date. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub will promptly furnish all information concerning such
Person and its Affiliates to the Company, and provide such other assistance to
the Company, as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, and the
Proxy Statement will include all information reasonably requested by Parent
and Merger Sub to be included therein. If at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Merger, the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
partners or officers should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
such document would not contain any

 



44  misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties and the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall give Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC
for mailing to the Companys stockholders, the Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold (on a date selected by the Company and reasonably
acceptable to Parent) the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory
vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith. The Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company
Board Recommendation, include such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, except, in each case, during such time as a
valid Adverse Recommendation Change is in effect. The Company may,
without the prior consent of Parent, make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required under
applicable Law is timely provided to the Companys stockholders within a
reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside counsel), in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if required by applicable Law or a request from
the SEC or its staff or (iii) if, on a date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present; _provided_ that (A) the duration of any
such adjournment or postponement shall be limited to the minimum duration
reasonably necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise to
such adjournment or postponement, (B) no single such adjournment or
postponement shall be for more than five Business Days except as may be
required by federal securities Laws, and (C) in the case of clause (iii), the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed to later than the date
that is ten Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent.
All other postponements or adjournments shall require the prior written
consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Company agrees that (i) its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other Person of any Takeover Proposal or
the occurrence of an Intervening Event and (ii) unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Companys obligation to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting will
not be affected by the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



45 Section 6.02 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent
Merger Sub, and the Equity Investor, and their respective Representatives,
reasonable access during normal working hours upon reasonable advance notice
to the officers, employees, agents, assets, properties, offices, plants and
other facilities, books and records of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , however, that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Equity Investor, or their respective Representatives, may access or enter
onto any property, office, plant or other facility, or otherwise inquire about
or investigate the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries operations, for
purposes of conducting any environmental site visit, assessment,
investigation (including any testing, sampling or intrusive measures) without
the prior, express written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 6.02 to the contrary, the Company may withhold any document or
information the disclosure of which (i) would cause a violation of applicable
Law or (ii) would be reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege (
_provided_ that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure (or as much as possible) in a manner that would not
be reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege). If any material is
withheld by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it
will, to the extent possible without violating Law or risking a loss of legal
privilege, inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld.
All information obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.02 will be held confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Bilateral Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated September 9, 2016 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Canyon Bridge Capital
Partners, Inc.

Section 6.03 _Financing Arrangements_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii) impose new or additional (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the receipt of the Financing,
(iii) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, or (iv) impede, prevent or
materially delay the Closing or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall have the right to permit the Equity Investor or any
other party to the Equity Commitment Letter to assign its or their commitments
thereunder to other equity financing sources, to the extent consistent with
the prior sentence and to the extent that this would not reasonably
be expected to impede, delay, prevent or adversely impact receipt of the HSR
Antitrust Clearance, the CFIUS Approval, or any other Regulatory Filing or
necessary approval or clearance under Section 6.04(a)(ii). Any reference in
this Agreement to the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this
Section 6.03 and "Equity Commitment Letter" will include such document as
amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.03.

 



46 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Equity Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy all conditions to funding
that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Equity Commitment Letter,
(iii) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) comply
with its obligations pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent will
notify the Company as soon as reasonably practicable if, at any time prior to
the Closing Date, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason, (ii) the Equity Investor or any other equity
financing source notifies Parent that it no longer intends to provide
financing to Parent in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter, or (iii)
for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to
obtain the Financing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.03 will require, and in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action
against the Equity Investor or any other financing source (including
any financing source of the Equity Investor) to enforce its rights pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) seek the Financing from any source
other than the Equity Investor or in any amount in excess of that contemplated
by the Equity Commitment Letter.

(d) Prior to the Closing, and without limiting its obligations pursuant to
Section 6.04, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, in each case, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement and consummation of
the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries), including by participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions at reasonable times and
with reasonable advance notice, and furnishing Parent and the Equity Investor
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery of a
request therefor to the Company by Parent (which notice shall state with
specificity the information requested) for such financial and other
information regarding the Company as is reasonably available to the Company at
such time and is customarily provided in connection with such financings; it
being understood that the Company shall have satisfied its obligations if the
Company shall have used its reasonable efforts to comply with such obligations
whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided.
The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this Section 6.03 that would: (i) require the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any directors of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Financing or execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any
existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement; (ii) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries; (iii) require the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the
Closing or have any obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
any agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective prior to the
Closing; (iv) cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any personal liability; (v)
conflict with any applicable Laws or the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or
the organizational documents of any Company

 



47  Subsidiary; (vi) reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or
breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both)
under, any Material Contract; (vii) prepare any financial statements or
information that are not available to it and prepared in the ordinary course
of its financial reporting practice; or (viii) require the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into any instrument or agreement that is
effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if
the Closing does not occur. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or Company Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any
action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.03
and any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent such
losses or liabilities arose out of or resulted from (i) information provided
in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of
its or their respective Representatives or (ii) the gross negligence, fraud,
bad faith or Willful Breach by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
its or their respective Representatives.

 

(e) If requested by Parent, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation
to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging for, at the Closing, the termination or
redemption of (i) the Indebtedness of the Company set forth in Section 6.03(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) any other Indebtedness of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries, together with the procurement of customary
payoff letters in connection therewith; _provided_ that in no event shall this
Section 6.03(e) require the Company to cause any such Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to be terminated prior to the Effective Time.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
provisions contained in this Section 6.03 represent the sole obligation of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger
and the other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and no other
provision of this Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto)
shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.

 

Section 6.04 _Required Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, including as required under any
Material Contract or Material Lease and (ii) obtain all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities, make all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings and take all reasonable best efforts to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity, including making
the Regulatory Filings and obtaining the HSR Antitrust Clearance and the CFIUS
Approval.

 



48 (b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced
in Section 6.04(a), Parent or Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and the Company Subsidiaries,
if applicable), on the other hand, shall (i) prepare and file with the FTC and
the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR
Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within 30 days following the date of this Agreement), (ii) jointly
prepare and pre-file with CFIUS a draft joint voluntary notice pursuant to the
DPA relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and then as
soon as reasonably practicable after CFIUS notification that the draft joint
voluntary notice meets all requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 800.402 of the
regulations, jointly file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the
DPA with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
promptly determine whether any other filings are required to be made with, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required
to be obtained from, any Governmental Entity under any other applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and if so, to prepare
and file any such filings and to seek any such other consents, approvals,
permits or authorizations (the filings described in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) collectively, " _Regulatory Filings_ ").

 

(c) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in
Section 6.04(a) or the obligations of the Parties under Section 6.04(b), each
of Parent and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
not prohibited by the applicable Governmental Entity, (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other Parties in the making of Regulatory Filings
(including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies, or
portions thereof, of all such documents to the non-filing Parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation, request or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity under any
applicable Law with respect to any Regulatory Filing, (ii) supply the other
Parties with any information and reasonable assistance that may be required
or reasonably requested in connection with the making of any Regulatory Filing
within a reasonable period, (iii) supply, within an allowed reasonable period,
any additional or supplemental information or assistance that may be required
or requested by the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS and any other applicable Governmental
Entity to which any such filing is made under any other applicable Law, and
(iv) subject to Section 6.04(f), use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the HSR Antitrust Clearance and the CFIUS Approval, in
each case as soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the
consummation of the Merger under any applicable Law, including using
reasonable best efforts to take all such action as may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental
Entity or Person may assert with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and the Company Subsidiaries,
if applicable), on the other hand, shall, to the extent practicable and unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity,
promptly inform the other Parties of any material communication from
any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated

 



49  by this Agreement in connection with any Regulatory Filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Entity relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Actions
initiated by a private party. If any Party or Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof shall receive a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to a Regulatory
Filing, then such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, the Parties will (i)
give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any
Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in
each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other Parties apprised with respect to

opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views
of the other with respect to, all material written communications (including
applications, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions) with a Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (vi) provide each other (or counsel of
each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all material written communications
to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby. Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one Party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis if allowed or required under applicable Law.

 

(e) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in
Section 6.04(a) or the obligations of the Parties under Section 6.04(b),
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including Section 6.04(f)),
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall offer to take (and if such
offer is accepted, to take or commit to take) all steps: (i) necessary to
obtain all consents, approvals or nonactions required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) necessary to avoid or
eliminate impediments under any Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ,
CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the
Merger and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the Outside Date, and, if
necessary, will participate in any Action in order to defend against any
action by any Governmental Entity or private party to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to (and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent) become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise
take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion
of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates,

 



50  (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets,
business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
any manner, (iii) agree to any Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence
mitigation arrangement, including any Special Security Agreement, National
Security Agreement or other mitigation arrangement, or (iv) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that to the extent necessary to obtain the HSR Antitrust Clearance or the
CFIUS Approval, the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) take or agree to take the actions set forth
in Section 6.04(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter and take or agree to take
other actions or accept other restrictions or conditions if, but only if, such
actions, restrictions or conditions, considered collectively, would not
reasonably be expected to (i) cause Parents control or ownership of the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to be passive or to
otherwise restrict the ability of Parent to control and operate the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
assets or operations by a requirement to enter into a Special Security
Agreement or similar arrangement, appoint a proxy or elect one or more
independent directors to the board of directors or governing body of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except
through a requirement to relinquish ownership rights permitted pursuant to the
following subsection; (ii) require Parent to divest, exclusively
license, transfer, hold separate, cease operating or otherwise relinquish
ownership rights with respect to one or more FPGA, CPLD or wireless business
units, product lines, assets or technologies of the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries whose total revenue (A) over the 12 month period
ended the date of this Agreement has exceeded, in the aggregate, $10.0
million, or (B) is anticipated to exceed in the period ending 24 months after
the date of this Agreement based on forecasts provided by the Company to
Parent, in the aggregate, $10.0 million or (iii) adversely affect in a
material manner the operation or management of the Surviving Corporations and
the Company Subsidiaries businesses, as conducted as of the date hereof,
except through a requirement to relinquish ownership rights permitted pursuant
to the preceding subsection.

 

(g) Parent shall adopt this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
and provide duly executed proof of such adoption to the Company immediately
following the execution of this Agreement.

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each
former and present director or officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws (and comparable governing documents of the Company
Subsidiaries) or in any Contract with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(which Contracts are set forth in Section 3.15(b)(vi) of the Company
Disclosure Letter), in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

 



51 (b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the directors and officers
liability insurance policies in effect as of the Effective Time by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries on terms and conditions not less favorable to
the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, except that in no event will Parent be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium
payable by the Company for such insurance policy in effect on July 1, 2016
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such insurance
can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount,
Parent will obtain the most advantageous policy of directors and officers
insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In
lieu of the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent
may in its discretion purchase if the Company declines to do so, a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the six-year
period from and after the Effective Time on terms and conditions not less
favorable to the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, _provided_ that without Parents consent, the cost of such "tail" policy
will not exceed the Maximum Amount.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. The
provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives
and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 6.06 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 8.02(b) and
Section 8.02(c), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not such transactions are consummated.

 

Section 6.07 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company will as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within two Business Days of being
served, notify Parent in writing of and give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of, any Action against the Company or
its Representatives by a holder of securities of the Company relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and no such settlement
will be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting
in any way the Companys obligations under Section 6.04, the Company will
cooperate, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to cooperate, in the defense against such Action.

 



52 Section 6.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 6.09 _Public Announcements_. The Parties agree that the initial press
release(s) to be issued with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall
be in a form mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of
Parent and the Company agree that no public release, announcement, press
conference, conference call with investors or analysts or other public
statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein
(or that could reasonably be expected to relate to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein) will be issued, held or made by any Party or
its Subsidiaries without prior consultation with and the prior consent of the
other Party, except as may be required by applicable Law, in which case the
Party required to make the release or announcement will use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the relevant Party
will consider such comments in good faith, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.09 will not apply to any release or
announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with any
Takeover Proposal.

 

Section 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that
purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire
or vote Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to
be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company
Board shall take all action reasonably available to it to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

Section 6.11 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the de-listing
by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, _provided_ the Company shall not be required to take
any action that would be effective or irrevocable prior to the Effective

Section 6.13 _Employees_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent to provide each Company Employee who
continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) at least the same level of base salary or
hourly wage rate, as the case may be, that was provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash
performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or cash-settled equity based
incentive opportunities) that are no less than the target annual cash
performance bonus opportunities in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance pay and
benefits to any Continuing Employee who incurs a "qualifying termination" at
any time during the one-year period following the Effective Time at levels
that are no less favorable than the levels of such severance pay and benefits
as in effect under the applicable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to
the Effective Time (where, for such purpose, "qualifying termination" shall
mean any termination of employment that would have resulted in severance pay
and benefits under such Company Benefit Plan if such termination had occurred
immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (iv) other employee benefits
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent to, pay the amount of any cash bonus
or commission that becomes earned and payable to eligible employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of those Company
Benefit Plans that are cash bonus or commission plans set forth in Section
6.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and made available to Parent by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, for the fiscal year in which the
Effective Time occurs in accordance with their terms.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent to, cause any
employee benefit plans (but excluding any defined benefit pension, retiree
welfare benefit or equity compensation plans) in which any Continuing Employee
is eligible to participate following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits thereunder, service with the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessor entities, in each case, to the
same extent such service was recognized under a

 



54  comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service). With respect to any Post-Closing Plan
that is a health or welfare benefit plan which replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause its
Affiliates to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions
and all waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee to the extent waived or
satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide
that Continuing Employees will be immediately eligible to participate in any
such Post-Closing Plan, without any waiting period, to the extent such
Continuing Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) credit each
Continuing Employee for any applicable amounts paid or eligible expenses
incurred (whether in the nature of co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts
applied toward deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses) by such Continuing
Employee (and his or her covered dependents) under the terms of the Company
Benefit Plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-
of-pocket requirements under the applicable Post-Closing Plan that replaces
such Company Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

 

(c) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation and paid time off to which
any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation and paid time
off policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent to, assume the liability for such accrued vacation and
paid time off and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued vacation
and paid time off in accordance with the practice and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent.

 

(d) The Company shall not implement any plant closing or layoff of employees
that implicates the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
or any similar applicable Law from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time without advance notice to Parent.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.13 or any other provision of this
Agreement (i) will confer upon any Company Employee or other individual
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) will be construed to
amend or modify, as of the date of this Agreement, any Company Benefit Plan
or any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement sponsored by Parent or its Affiliates, (iii) limits the ability of
Parent or its Affiliates to amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy or Contract that is assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, _provided_ any such amendment or
modification must comply with the terms thereof and applicable Law, (iv)
creates any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person
(including any Continuing Employee) other than the Parties, or (v) limits the
right of Parent or its Affiliates to terminate, in accordance with applicable
Law, the employment or service of any Company Employee or other individual
service provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

Association, as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ "), as collateral and security

funds to the Paying Agent);

Escrow Account following the release contemplated by the foregoing clause
(d)(i), unless prior to the expiration of such 10 day period Parent has
commenced an Action seeking to enjoin such release, in which case no funds
from the Escrow Account will be released unless and until (A) such Action has
been finally resolved and the Escrow Agent receives an Order setting forth
the manner in which all funds held in the Escrow Account are to be released or
(B) the Escrow Agent receives joint instructions from Parent and the Company
with respect to the release of the funds held in the Escrow Account; and

 

(e) 30 days following the date on which the Escrow Agent and the Company are
each advised in writing by Parent that this Agreement has been validly

funds held in the Escrow Account will be released to Parent or its designees
in accordance with the instructions set forth in such written notice from
Parent unless prior to the expiration of such 30 day period (i) the Company

Section 9.05 _General Interpretation_. The Parties agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, drafting, preparation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law
or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. In this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise provided or that
the context otherwise requires: (a) when a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Exhibit, Article, 

 



74  Section or Schedule, such reference is to an Exhibit, Article or Section of,
or a Schedule to, this Agreement; (b) the table of contents and headings for
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and do not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (c) whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation;" (d) the words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in
this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (e) references to any statute, rule
or regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes,
include any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes) and to any
section of any statute, rule or regulation include any successor to said
section; (f) references to any Contract are to such Contract as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time; (g) all terms defined
in this Agreement have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined
therein; (h) references to a Person are also to its successors and permitted
assigns; (i) the use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive; (j) references
to monetary amounts are to the lawful currency of the United States; and (k)
words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa and words
importing gender include all genders.

Section 9.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights
under this Section 9.06 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision (or part thereof) is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.07 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more consecutive counterparts (including by facsimile, or ".pdf"
transmission), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered (electronically or otherwise) to the other
Parties.

 

Section 9.08 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, the Escrow Agreement, the
documents and agreements contemplated hereby and the Confidentiality
Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities, except (i) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the former holders of Shares to receive the
Merger Consideration and the holders of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs
to receive such other payments, in each case as provided and to the extent set
forth in Article II, (ii) as provided in Section 6.05 (which is intended for
the benefit of the Company Indemnified Parties) and (iii) as provided in
Section 8.02(f) (which is intended for the benefit of the Equity Investor and
the other Specified Persons). In addition and notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Equity Investor and the other Specified Persons are
intended third party beneficiaries under this Section 9.08 and Section 9.12.

 



75 Section 9.09 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Dispute Resolution_.

(a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of Law (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Except with respect to an Arbitration Action, each of the Parties hereby
(i) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent such
court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court within the State of Delaware, or, if such federal court declines to
accept jurisdiction, any state court within the State of Delaware that has
jurisdiction) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees that it
will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in any court other than
such court, (iv) agrees that each of the other Parties will have the right to
bring any Action for enforcement of a judgment entered by such court and (v)
expressly and irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in
such court or that any such Action brought in such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action
will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.09(b), any Action (i) taken pursuant to Section
9.11 seeking an Order of specific performance or other equitable relief of
Parents obligations hereunder or (ii) taken by the Company against Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.02 seeking damages for fraud or Willful
Breach (any such Action referred to in subclauses (i) and (ii), an "
_Arbitration Action_ "), shall be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (" _SIAC Rules_ ") for the time being in force, which rules
are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the
arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 3 arbitrators.
The language of the arbitration shall be English. The Parties agree that any
arbitration commenced pursuant to this clause shall be conducted in accordance
with the Expedited Procedure set out in Rule 5.2 of the SIAC Rules. Each
of the Parties hereby expressly and irrevocably agrees that a final ruling in
such arbitral Action will be conclusive and may be enforced in any
jurisdiction by suit or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that Arbitration Actions will only be resolved in accordance with
Section 9.09(c), and any other Action or dispute arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, will
only be resolved in accordance with Section 9.09(b). 

 



76 Section 9.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of the other Parties and any purported assignment without
such consent will be void. Subject to the preceding sentences this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, the Parties will, subject to Section 9.11(b), be
entitled to an Order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to the granting of an Order of specific performance or other
equitable relief of Parents obligation to take the actions it is entitled to
take to cause the full funding of the Financing under the Equity Commitment
Letter and to consummate the Merger if and only in the event each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in Section
7.01 (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01(c) or 7.01(d) which
have not been satisfied due to any Action of a PRC Governmental Entity or
the impact of any Law or Order enacted or issued by a PRC Governmental
Entity, and to the extent a non-worldwide closing is possible) and Section
7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but each of which at such time is capable of being satisfied)
have been satisfied or waived; (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate
the Closing when required pursuant to Section 1.02; and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that it is ready, willing
and able to consummate the Closing and that if an Order of specific
performance or other equitable relief is granted and the Financing is
consummated, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of an Order of specific performance or other
equitable relief as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this Section
9.11(b) and to consummate the Merger and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by Section
8.02(c)), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (i) such grant of an Order of specific performance or other
equitable relief to cause the funding of the Financing and to consummate the
Merger and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 



77 Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.
