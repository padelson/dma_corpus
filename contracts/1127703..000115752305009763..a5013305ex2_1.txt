a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 2.4. Validity. Each Company, Holdings

3     Companies, Holdings and the Parent, as applicable, in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws

end of each calendar month which is completed prior to the Closing Date,
commencing October 31, 2005, Holdings shall cause to be delivered to the
Buyer monthly financial information of the Companies in the form of Exhibit
2.7(b) attached hereto.   (c) Each of the balance sheets referred to in
Section 2.7(a) and 2.7(b)(i) and (ii) presents (or will present) fairly the
financial condition, assets, liabilities and shareholders\' equity of each of
Holdings and the Companies as of its date; each such statement of earnings or
shareholders\' equity referred to above presents (or will present) fairly the
results of operations of each of Holdings and the Companies, as the case may
be, for the periods indicated; and each such statement of cash flows referred
to above presents fairly the information purported to be shown therein,
except, in each case, interim unaudited financial statements need not reflect
year-end adjustments. The financial statements referred to in Section 2.7(a)
and Section 2.7(b)(i), including all notes and schedules thereto, have been
(or will be) prepared in accordance with GAAP throughout the periods involved
(except, in the case of unaudited financial statements, for the absence of
footnotes and year-end adjustments) and are (or will be) in accordance with
the books and records of each of Holdings and the Companies, which books and
records are correct and complete in all material respects.    5     
(d) Each of the Companies maintains accurate books and records reflecting its
assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate internal
accounting controls over financial reporting which provide assurance that (i)
transactions are executed with management\'s authorization; (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements
of each of the Companies and to maintain accountability for the assets of
each of the Companies; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management\'s authorization; (iv) the reporting of assets is compared
with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and
other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and

current and timely basis. Neither the auditors nor the board of directors or
audit committee of either of the Companies or any of the Companies\'
corporate parents have been advised of: (x) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of the internal controls over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Section 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules
13d-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of either of
the Companies which could adversely affect either Company\'s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, or (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a role in the internal controls over financial reporting of the
Companies.   (e) At the dates of the aforementioned balance sheets, neither
Company had (or will have with respect to such balance sheets dated
subsequent to the date hereof) any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become
due, and whether or not required to be disclosed on a balance sheet prepared
in conformity with GAAP, not fully or properly reflected or reserved against
in such balance sheets, or in any notes thereto, other than liabilities
pursuant to contractual obligations identified in this Agreement or the
Company Disclosure Schedule.   (f) Holdings has delivered or made available
to the Buyer true, correct and complete copies of all filings required to be
made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by or with
respect to Holdings since December 31, 2001, including, Holdings\' (i) Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, as filed
with the SEC, (ii) proxy statements relating to all of Holdings\' meetings of
stockholders since December 31, 2001, and (iii) all other reports, statements
and registration statements (including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and
Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed by Holdings with the SEC since December
31, 2001 (collectively, the "SEC Filings"). As of their respective dates, the
SEC Filings did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (g) MEEMIC Insurance has $2 million on deposit with
the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Services.   (h) All
receivables, bonds, notes, debts, liabilities and other obligations of any
kind or nature owed to the Companies, including agent   
6     balances, represent arm\'s length transactions actually made in the
ordinary course of business, are collectible in the ordinary course of
business.   Section 2.8. Statutory Financial Statements.   (a) There have
been made available to the Buyer true, correct and complete copies of (i) the
statutory financial statements (including the annual reports filed in each
state in which MEEMIC Insurance is admitted or approved) for MEEMIC Insurance
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and (ii) the statutory
financial statements (including quarterly reports filed in each state in
which MEEMIC Insurance is admitted or approved) for MEEMIC Insurance for the
first two quarters in the year 2005, and Holdings will deliver to the Buyer
true, correct and complete copies of such statements for all quarters which
are filed prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Statutory Statements").   (b) The Statutory Statements each present (or
will present) fairly, on a consistent basis and in accordance with the
practices prescribed or permitted by the appropriate regulatory agencies of
each state in which the Statutory Statements have been or may be required to
be filed, the financial position of MEEMIC Insurance at the date of each such
statement and the results of MEEMIC Insurance\'s operations for each such
referenced period. Further, the exhibits and schedules included in the
Statutory Statements are fairly stated in relation to MEEMIC Insurance and
the Statutory Statements comply in all material respects with applicable
regulatory requirements.   (c) The amounts shown in the Statutory Statements
as reserves and liabilities for past and future insurance policy benefits,
losses, claims and expenses under insurance policies were computed in
accordance with commonly accepted actuarial standards consistently applied,
were fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles, were based
on actuarial assumptions that were in accordance with those called for in
policy provisions and met the requirements of applicable insurance laws, and
such amounts shown on Statutory Statements filed after the date hereof and on
or prior to the Closing Date will be so computed and based on the same
principles used in prior periods.   (d) MEEMIC Insurance has all necessary
letters of credit or other security devices in all cases where needed, and
all such letters of credit and security devices comply in all material
respects with all applicable laws and regulations, to enable it to take a
credit against its liabilities in, or increase its assets by, the amount of
the letter of credit or security device. Schedule 2.8(d) identifies all
letters of credit and other security devices held or maintained for the
benefit of MEEMIC Insurance to support receivable balances from unauthorized
reinsurers.   (e) All reserves and other similar amounts with respect to
insurance written by MEEMIC Insurance as established or reflected in the
Statutory Statements were computed in accordance with commonly accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied and are fairly stated in accordance
with sound actuarial principles that are in accordance with those called for
by the provisions of the related insurance contracts and in the related
reinsurance, coinsurance, and other similar Contracts of MEEMIC Insurance,
which meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of its
state of domicile and of the states in which such insurance contracts were
issued or delivered. All such reserves and related actuarial items held in
support of the insurance    7     contracts written by MEEMIC
Insurance, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to the
reserves and related actuarial items, will make good, sufficient and adequate
provision (under commonly accepted actuarial standards consistently applied
and fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles) to cover the
total amount of all reasonably anticipated matured and unmatured benefits,
dividends, claims, expenses and other liabilities of MEEMIC Insurance under
all insurance contracts under which MEEMIC Insurance has or will have any
liability (including, without limitation, any liability arising under or as a
result of any reinsurance, coinsurance, or other similar contract) on the
respective dates of such Statutory Statements. MEEMIC Insurance owns
assets that qualify as legal reserve assets under applicable insurance laws
in an amount at least equal to all such required reserves and other similar
amounts.   Section 2.9. Events Since December 31, 2004. Since December 31,

sharing plan, pool, joint underwriting association or similar arrangement

Reinsurance Agreement, and has satisfied all applicable underwriting
standards required thereunder in all material respects. All benefits to
MEEMIC Insurance reflected on the Statutory Statements in respect of the
Reinsurance Agreements are appropriately calculated under the terms of the
Reinsurance Agreements. All amounts owing by MEEMIC Insurance in respect of
the Reinsurance Agreements are properly reflected in the Statutory Statements
and in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles ("SAP"). The
termination of any Reinsurance Agreement will not result in adverse tax
consequences to MEEMIC Insurance. The reinsurance recoverables, net of
related reserves for uncollectible accounts, set forth on the Statutory
Statements are consistent with industry practice and past experience.   (c)
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.12(c), since December 31, 2004, no Contract

any such Contract.   (d) Holdings has made available to the Buyer written
summaries of all oral contracts and agreements referred to in this Section
2.12 and has made available to the Buyer with true and correct copies of all
of such written contracts and agreements. As used in this Agreement, the

contract, agreement, commitment, understanding and promise, whether written
or oral.    13      Section 2.13. No Default. Holdings, the respective
Company, or the Parent, as applicable, has performed, or is now performing,
the obligations of, and is not in default (and would not by the lapse of time
and/or the giving of notice be in default), nor has received notice of
default or notice of termination, in respect of any Contract. To the
knowledge of either Company, Holdings or the Parent, no other party who is a
party to or bound by any of the Contracts is in default thereunder. Each of
the Contracts is a legal, binding and enforceable obligation of or against
Holdings, the applicable Company, or the Parent, as applicable. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the knowledge of either Company,
Holdings or the Parent, there are no facts or circumstances which make a
default under, or termination or suspension of, any of the contracts or
obligations referred to in this Section likely to occur subsequent to the
date hereof nor has any third party raised any claim, dispute or controversy
with respect to such contracts or obligations.   Section 2.14. Renewal

conditions.   Section 2.15. Personal Property. Schedule 2.15 contains a list

(i) real property owned by either Company (the "Company-Owned Real
Property"), and (ii) real property leased, or under option to be leased, to
either Company (the "Company-Leased Real Property," and together with the
Company-Owned Real Property, the "Real Property"). No real property leased by
Holdings, the Parent or any other entity is occupied or used, in whole or in
part, by either Company.   (b) Schedule 2.16 sets forth a description of all
encumbrances, easements or rights of way of record granted on or appurtenant
to or otherwise affecting the Company-Owned Real Property. All Company-Leased
Real Property is held under valid and existing leases. The applicable Company
enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession of all Real Property. All
buildings or structures located on the Real Property and occupied by either
Company are of a general type or nature customarily used for office and

Owned Real Property has permanent rights of access to dedicated public
highways. There is not (i) any claim of adverse possession or prescriptive
rights involving any of the Company-Owned Real Property, (ii) any structure
located on any Company-Owned Real Property which encroaches on or over the
boundaries of neighboring or adjacent properties or (iii) any structure of
any other party which encroaches on or over the boundaries of any of such
Company-Owned Real Property. Except as set forth on    14     Schedule
2.16, none of the Company-Owned Real Property is located in a flood plain,
flood hazard area, wetland or lakeshore erosion area within the meaning of
any law, regulation or ordinance. No public improvements have been
commenced, neither Company, Holdings nor the Parent have received notice that
any public improvements are planned, which in either case may result in
special assessments against or otherwise materially adversely affect any
Company-Owned Real Property. Neither the whole nor any portion of the
Company-Owned Real Property is subject to any judgment, order or decree of
any governmental authority to be sold or is being condemned, expropriated or
otherwise taken with or without payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the
knowledge of either Company, Holdings or the Parent, has any such
condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed.   Section 2.17. Title;
Condition of Assets.   (a) Each Company has good and marketable title to all
of its respective real and tangible personal property, including, without
limitation, all such properties reflected in the Balance Sheet of such
Company, as applicable, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, security
interests, claims, pledges, licenses, equities, options, conditional sales
contracts, assessments, levies, easements, covenants, reservations,
restrictions, rights of way, exceptions, limitations, charges or encumbrances
of any nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") except those described on
Schedule 2.17 and, in the case of any Company-Owned Real Property, Liens for
taxes not yet due or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings (and which have been sufficiently accrued or reserved against in
the applicable Balance Sheet), municipal and zoning ordinances and easements
for public utilities, none of which interfere with the use of the property as
currently utilized. None of each Company\'s assets, business or properties is
subject to any restrictions with respect to the transferability thereof; and
such Company\'s title thereto will not be affected in any way by the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) All property and assets owned or
utilized by each Company are in good operating condition and repair in all
material respects.   Section 2.18. Environmental.   (a) No Hazardous
Materials (as defined in paragraph (e) below) have been used, stored or

any other affiliate of the Parent on, under, in, from or affecting any of the
Real Property, other than cleaning solvents and similar materials used in de
minimis amounts in the ordinary course of business and in compliance
with Environmental Laws (as defined below). To the knowledge of either
Company, Holdings or the Parent, no current or prior owner or occupant of the
Real Property has used Hazardous Materials on, under, in, from or affecting
the Real Property in violation of any Environmental Laws.   (b) No
Hazardous Materials have at any time been released into, stored or deposited
by Holdings, either Company, the Parent or any other affiliate of the Parent
within or on the Real Property, by Holdings, either Company, the Parent or
any other affiliate of the Parent into any water systems on or below
the surface of the Real Property, or by Holdings, either Company, the Parent
or any    15     other affiliate of the Parent directly or indirectly
onto any property or water system adjoining, adjacent to or abutting the Real
Property, or have been used by Holdings, either Company, the Parent or any
other affiliate of the Parent in the construction of any improvements located
on or about the Real Property.   (c) Neither Holdings, either Company, the
Parent nor any other affiliate of the Parent has received any notice of any
violations (nor do they know of any existing violations) of any applicable
laws governing the use, storage, treatment, transportation, manufacture,
refinement, handling, production or disposal of Hazardous Materials on,
under, in, from or affecting the Real Property and there are not any legal
actions or proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of either Company,
Holdings or the Parent, threatened by any person with respect to any such
violations.   (d) The Real Property is currently being, and has in the past
been, operated by Holdings, the Companies and the Parent in accordance with,

Employee Benefit Plans, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Employee Benefit Plans, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits payable under any Employee Benefit
Plans to any extent. Each Employee Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued in accordance with its terms without liability to
either Company or any ERISA Affiliate; provided, however, that the

statements prepared by the Companies or the Buyer with respect to periods on
or after the Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include each party making
all applicable information and documents in its possession relating to the
Companies available to the other party. Each of the parties shall also make
available to the other party, as reasonably requested and available,
personnel (including officers, directors, employees and agents) responsible
for preparing, maintaining, and interpreting information and documents
relevant to financial information of the Companies, and personnel reasonably
required as witnesses or for purposes of providing information or documents
in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to
financial information of the Companies. Each requesting party shall reimburse
the applicable counterparties for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by each such counterparty in complying with this subsection. No party is
required to provide the other with any confidential or proprietary
information of either Company, Holdings, Parent, the Buyer or any of the
Buyer\'s affiliates, as the case may be, after the Closing Date, except to
the extent required for the filing of financial statements and resolution or
investigation of such financial statements that relate to Pre-Effective
Periods. Any information, documents and/or other assistance provided pursuant
to this Section 4.18 shall be made without representation or warranty as to
its accuracy (except to the extent otherwise represented or warranted to
under Article II above).   Section 4.20. Reserve Adequacy Audit. The parties
agree that MEEMIC Insurance shall engage it current actuarial firm, or
another independent actuarial consultant mutually acceptable to the parties
(the "Actuary"), to conduct a normal reserve review as of each of December
31, 2005 and June 30, 2006 (the "Reserve Reviews"). In connection with the
June 30, 2006 Reserve Review, the Actuary shall determine its best estimate
of reserves (net of reinsurance, for purposes of this analysis all
reinsurance balances are assumed to be valid and fully collectible) for loss
and loss adjustment expense claim liability arising out of and in connection
with accident periods ending on or before the Closing Date ("Actuary\'s Best
Estimate"). The Actuary\'s Best Estimate shall be determined by calculating
the best estimate of reserves as of December 31, 2005 and rolling forward
such amount to the Closing Date by taking into    38     account
adjustments for claim payments during the period from December 31, 2005 up to
the Closing Date and adding thereto the estimated amount of ultimate losses
for claims incurred during such period, in each case as calculated
in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial standards consistently
applied; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs on or before January
6, 2006, the Actuary\'s Best Estimate will be calculated as of December 31,
2005 with no roll forward to the actual Closing Date. In the event that the
Actuary\'s Best Estimate is greater than the amounts so reserved in the
balance sheet of MEEMIC Insurance as of the Closing Date (or if the Closing
occurs on or before January 6, 2005, the audited balance sheet of MEEMIC
Insurance as of December 31, 2005), as prepared by MEEMIC Insurance
consistent with the Balance Sheets, Holdings and the Parent agree (subject to
the completion of the additional review process described below), jointly and
severally, to pay to the Buyer the amount by which such excess amount exceeds
$3,000,000, after factoring all of the associated tax benefits associated
with the increase in reserves based on a marginal tax rate of 35% (such
amount to be paid being referred to as the "Reserve
Deficiency Reimbursement"). Holdings and the Parent will have the option of
retaining a nationally recognized independent actuary of their choosing (the
"Second Actuary") and at their cost to perform an independent review of
reserves. If the results of the review of the Second Actuary result in a
decrease in the Reserve Deficiency Reimbursement by more than $1,000,000,
then the parties agree to have Actuary and the Second Actuary appoint a third
actuary (the costs of which will be shared equally by Holdings and the Buyer)
and the average of all three studies will be utilized for purposes of the
calculation of the Reserve Deficiency Reimbursement. Each party shall be
entitled to copies of the Reserve Review results when, and in the form,
delivered by the Actuary, the Second Actuary and the third actuary (subject
to each party delivering a standard form reserve release letter as may be
requested by the applicable actuary). Holdings and/or the Parent shall remit
the Reserve Deficiency Reimbursement to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the final June 30, 2006 Reserve Review results.   Section 4.21.
Continuation of Employee Plans.   (a) From and after the Closing, the
Employee Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement and at the
Closing, other than any Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Parent
(including, without limitation the Stock Ownership Plan and any of the
Parent\'s stock option plans) shall remain in effect with respect to the
current and former employees of the Companies (the "Company Employees")
covered by such Employee Benefit Plans at the Closing, until such time as the
Buyer shall otherwise determine. The Buyer agrees that it will honor all
Employee Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect at
the Closing, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be
required or permitted by the plans or applicable law. The Buyer will review
all Employee Benefit Plans to determine whether to maintain, terminate or
continue such plans.   (b) Company Employees who continue in employment
with the Companies ("Continuing Employees") who become participants in an
employee benefit plan of the Buyer or its affiliates ("Buyer Employee Plan")
shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any applicable
vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual
purposes unless specifically set forth herein) be given credit for meeting
eligibility and vesting requirements in such plans for service as an employee
of the Companies or any predecessor thereto prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that credit for benefit accrual purposes will be given only for
purposes of the Buyer\'s vacation    39     policies or programs. In
the event of any termination of any health plan of the Companies or
consolidation with any health plan of the Buyer or its affiliates, the Buyer
shall make available to Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-
provided health coverage on substantially the same basis as it provides such
coverage to other employees of the Buyer and its affiliates. Unless
a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a health plan
of Companies prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible
to participate in the Buyer\'s health plan, or unless a Continuing Employee
and/or a dependent of a Continuing Employee has an event which, under the
terms of the Companies\' health plan, results in a loss of coverage, no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall
terminate under any of the Companies health plans prior to the time such
Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in
the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Buyer and
their dependents. All Company Employees who cease participating in a Company
health plan and become participants in a Buyer Employee Plan during any plan
year shall receive credit toward the applicable deductible under the Buyer
Employee Plan for any amounts paid by the employee under the Company\'s
health plan during the applicable plan year, upon substantiation, in a form
satisfactory to the Buyer that such payments have been made.   (c) It is
understood that the Buyer and the Companies are "at-will" employers. Nothing
in this Section 4.21 shall be interpreted as preventing the Buyer or either
Company from terminating the employment of any individual or from amending,
modifying or terminating any Buyer Employee Plans, or any Employee Benefit
Plans, or any benefits under any Buyer Employee Plans or any Employee Benefit
Plans, or any other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings,
in accordance with their terms and applicable law.   (d) The Parent\'s board
of directors shall determine that the Acquisition will result in a change of
control as contemplated under the Parent\'s stock option plan, such that all
outstanding options granted to employees of the Companies to purchase capital
stock of the Parent which are not vested as of the Closing Date shall
automatically vest upon the Closing, which vesting shall occur without cost
to the Companies or the Buyer. Further, the Parent acknowledges and agrees
that upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, all "grant shares" issued to employees of the Companies under the
Amended and Restated ProAssurance Corporation Stock Ownership Plan (the
"Stock Ownership Plan") shall automatically vest and shall be transferred to
participating employees\' respective "Participant Accounts" (as defined in
the Stock Ownership Plan), and the vesting of such grant shares shall occur
without cost to the Companies or the Buyer.   Section 4.22. Release of
Holdings from Sales Representative Agreements. At the Closing, the Buyer
shall assume all obligations of Holdings arising on or after the Closing Date
under each Sales Representative Agreement, in effect as of the Closing Date,
among MEEMIC Services, Holdings and each MEEMIC Services sales representative
(the "Sales Representative Agreements"). In addition, following the Closing,
the Buyer and MEEMIC Services shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
have Holdings formally released from any obligations under the Sales
Representative Agreements and shall endeavor to obtain such releases prior to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Buyer and MEEMIC Services have not had Holdings formally released from
any such obligations, at any time after the second anniversary of   
40     the Closing Date, Holdings shall have the right, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, to prospectively revoke any warranty made by
it under any or all of the Sales Representative Agreements without recourse
from the Companies or the Buyer.   ARTICLE V  TAX MATTERS    Section
5.1. Tax Cooperation And Exchange of Information.   (a) Preparation and
Filing of Tax Returns/Tax Return Review.   (i) The Parent shall be
responsible for filing Tax Returns on behalf  of the Companies for tax
periods through and including the Closing Date. In  the case of the federal
income Tax Return, such Tax Return shall include  all items of income, gain,
loss, deduction and credit attributable to  either Company for the period
covering the beginning of the Parent\'s  current fiscal year through and
including the Closing Date. In making such  filing, the Parent shall not make
a ratable allocation election under  Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii), but
rather will make such filing based  on the actual items of income, gain,
loss, deduction and credit during the  applicable period covered by such
filing. However, the Parent will not file  or cause the filing of such
returns without the prior review by the Buyer  of each separate return or
report where separate returns or reports are  filed or of separate pro forma
information of the Companies where  consolidated or combined returns or
reports are filed. Tax Returns of the  Companies not yet filed for any Tax
Period that begins before the Closing  Date shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices employed  with respect to the Companies, and
neither the Parent nor Holdings shall  make any election in respect of such a
Tax Return without the prior written  consent of the Buyer.   (ii) The
Buyer or the Companies shall be responsible for filing all  Tax Returns on
behalf of the Companies for all tax periods commencing after  the Closing
Date. In making such filing for the taxable year commencing  immediately
after the Closing Date, no ratable allocation election shall be  made under
Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii).   (b) Notification of Tax Proceedings.
Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the extent either Company,
Holdings or the Parent has knowledge of the beginning or scheduling of any
Tax audit, the assessment of any Tax, the issuance of any notice of Tax due
or any bill for collection of any Tax due for Taxes, or the beginning or
scheduling of any other administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to
the determination, assessment or collection of any Tax of either Company or
otherwise with respect to the Business or the Companies, the Companies,
Holdings or the Parent will provide prompt notice in writing to the Buyer of
such matter, setting forth information describing any asserted Tax liability
in reasonable detail and including copies of any notice or other
documentation received from the applicable Tax authority with respect to such
matter.    41      (c) Tax Record Retention. The Companies (or their
auditors or accountants on its behalf) will retain all books, records, Tax
Returns, schedules, work papers, document and all material papers or relevant
items of information relating to the Federal, state, local and any other tax
liabilities of the Companies for any Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date for the full period of the applicable statute of limitations,
including any extensions thereof.   (d) Tax Return Amendment(s)/Filing of
Elections. Except to the extent required by law, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, none of the Companies, Holdings nor the Parent will
take or cause to be taken any of the following actions, directly or
indirectly which will or may affect either Company or the Buyer for any
period ending after the Closing Date:   (i) filing or amending any Tax
Return;   (ii) filing any Tax election;   (iii) executing any waiver of
restrictions on assessment or collection  of any Tax; or   (iv) entering
into or amending any agreement or settlement with any  Tax Authority.   (e)
Refund Claims. If the Buyer agrees to pay the reasonable costs incurred by
Holdings and/or the Parent, Holdings and/or the Parent will, upon request,
file any claim for refund or credit of any Tax on behalf of the Buyer or
either Company arising from the carryback of any deduction or credit of
the Buyer or either Company to any tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date.   (f) Cooperation Agreement.   (i) The Parent, Holdings, the
Companies and the Buyer will cooperate  fully with each other and each
other\'s agents, including legal counsel and  public accounting firms, in
connection with Tax matters relating to the  Companies, including without
limitation:   (A) preparing and filing Tax Returns and reports with respect
to  the Companies for any period, including but not limited to  Holdings\'
preparation of a Tax Return work paper package for  the Tax Periods ending on
or including the Closing Date;   (B) determining the liability and amount of
any Taxes due or the  right to and amount of any refund of Taxes;   (C)
examination of Tax Returns;   (D) any administrative or judicial proceeding
in respect of  Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed.    42     
(ii) Such cooperation will include each party making all information  and
documents in its possession relating to the Companies available to the  other
party.   (iii) Each of the parties will also make available to the other
party,  as reasonably requested and available, personnel (including
officers,  directors, employees and agents) responsible for preparing,
maintaining,  and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes,
and personnel  reasonably required as witnesses or for purposes of providing
information  or documents in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceedings  relating to Taxes. Each party will pay only for reasonable costs
incurred  by it in complying with this subsection.   (iv) No party is
required to provide the other with any confidential  or proprietary
information of either Company, the Buyer, Holdings, the  Parent or any of
their respective affiliates, as the case may be, after the  Closing Date,
except to the extent required for the filing of Tax Returns  and resolution
or investigation of tax controversies that relate to  Pre-Effective
Periods.   (g) Tax Controversies.   (i) Notice.   (A) If any Tax
Authority informs Holdings or the Parent, or  Holdings or the Parent
otherwise becomes aware, of any  notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment
or other dispute  concerning the amount of Taxes with respect to which
either  Company or the Buyer may incur liability hereunder (except  to the
extent such liability is for Taxes of a member of the  Parent\'s affiliated
group, other than the Companies, that  could only be imposed on either
Company under Treasury  Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision
of any  applicable Tax Law), Holdings or the Parent, as applicable,  will
promptly notify the Buyer in writing of such matter.  Similarly, if any Tax
Authority informs the Buyer or either  Company, or the Buyer or either
Company otherwise becomes  aware of, any notice of proposed audit, claim,
assessment or  other dispute concerning the amount of Taxes with respect to 
which Holdings or Parent may incur liability hereunder, the  Buyer will
promptly inform Holdings and the Parent in  writing of such matter.   (B)
Such notice will contain factual information (to the extent  known)
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable  detail and will be
accompanied by copies of any notice or  other documents received from any Tax
Authority with respect  to such matter.    43      (C) If an
Indemnified Party (as defined below) has knowledge of  an asserted Tax
liability with respect to a matter for which  it is to be indemnified under
Article IX, and such party  fails to provide the Indemnifying Party (as
defined below)  prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, then   (1) if
the Indemnifying Party is precluded from contesting  the asserted Tax
liability in any forum as a result of  the failure to give prompt notice, the
Indemnifying  Party will have no obligation to indemnify the  Indemnified
Party for Taxes arising out of such  asserted Tax liability, and   (2) if
the Indemnifying Party is not precluded from  contesting the asserted Tax
liability in any forum, but  such failure to provide prompt notice results in
a  monetary detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then any  amount which the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise  required to pay the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this  Agreement will be reduced by the amount of such 
detriment.   (ii) Control Rights. The party that is required to file a
return  pursuant to this Section will control any audits, disputes,
administrative,  judicial or other proceedings related to Taxes with respect
to which either  party may incur liability hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, if  an adverse determination may result in each party
having responsibility for  any amount of Taxes under this Article, each party
is entitled to fully  participate in that portion of the proceedings relating
to the Taxes with  respect to which it may incur liability hereunder. For
purposes of this  Section, the term "participation" will include:   (A)
participation in conferences, meetings or proceedings with  any Tax
Authority, the subject matter of which includes an  item for which such party
may have liability hereunder;   (B) participation in appearances before any
court or tribunal,  the subject of which includes an item for which a party
may  have liability hereunder; and   (C) with respect to the matters
described in the preceding  clauses (i) and (ii), participation in the
submission and  determination of the content of the documentation,
protests,  memorandum of fact and law, briefs, and the conduct of oral 
arguments and presentations.   (iii) Consent to Settlement. Neither Holdings
nor the Parent will  agree to settle any Tax liability or compromise any
claim in respect to  Taxes, which settlement or compromise may affect the
liability for Taxes    44      hereunder of either Company or the
Buyer, without the Buyer\'s prior written  consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  Similarly, neither the Buyer nor either
Company will agree to settle any  Tax liability or compromise any claim in
respect to Taxes, which settlement  or compromise may affect the liability
for Taxes hereunder of Holdings or  the Parent, without the consent of the
Parent (which consent will not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
(iv) Expenses. The Buyer, Holdings and the Parent will bear their own 
expenses incurred in connection with audits and other administrative 
judicial proceedings relating to Taxes for which such party and its 
affiliates are liable under this Article.   (h) The Companies shall
terminate their participation in the Consolidated Tax Allocation Agreement
dated September 1, 2005 between the Parent and its subsidiaries (the "Tax
Allocation Agreement") and any other tax sharing agreement between the
Companies and the Parent as of the Closing Date, and after the Closing Date,
the Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, within a reasonable time after the Closing
Date (but not later than the date for filing the tax return), the Companies
and the Parent, in accordance with Section 5.1(f) hereof, shall make a final
determination of the amounts that would be due under the Tax
Allocation Agreement (the "Final Tax Allocation Amount") for all Pre-
Effective Periods for which returns have not been filed, calculated on a
basis consistent with past practices, provided that the Final Tax Allocation
Amount shall not include any amount in respect of any adjustment to Taxes as
a result of an amended return, an audit or otherwise. The Final Tax
Allocation Amount shall be determined as if no Section 338(h)(10) election
had been made with respect to the Companies. The Final Tax Allocation Amount
shall be payable within thirty (30) days after such Allocation is determined
by the Companies and the Parent as provided herein.   Section 5.2. Section
338(h)(10) Election.   (a) At the request of the Buyer, Holdings and the
Parent shall make a joint election with the Buyer under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code and under any comparable or equivalent provisions of state or local
law with respect to the purchase of the Shares of either Company or both
Companies by the Buyer (an "Election"). If an Election is made, Holdings,
Parent and the Buyer shall report, in connection with the determination of
Taxes, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent
with the Election, including the reasonable determination of the fair market
value of the assets of the Companies and the allocation of the deemed
purchase price among the assets of the Companies under the provisions of
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.   (b) If an Election is made, the Buyer shall be responsible for
the preparation of all forms and documents required in connection with the
Election. In connection with the Election, no later than 60 Business Days
prior to the required due date thereof, the Buyer shall provide Holdings with
copies of (i) a properly executed Form 8023 (or any successor form), (ii) all
attachments required to be filed therewith pursuant to applicable state or
local elections being made pursuant to the Election. Holdings and Parent
shall execute and deliver to the Buyer within forty-five (45) days of the
required due date therefor, such documents or forms as are required by any
Tax laws to properly    45     complete the Election provided that all
information required to be furnished to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant
to the Election complies with the requirements of Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and the said Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Holdings, the
Parent and the Buyer shall cooperate fully with each other and make available
to each other such Tax data and other information as may be reasonably
required by Holdings and the Parent or the Buyer in order to timely file the
Election and any other required statements or schedules.   (c) Neither
Holdings nor the Parent shall take any action which is inconsistent with the
requirements for filing an Election under the Code and the applicable
regulations.   Section 5.3. Miscellaneous.   The Parent and Holdings, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other, agree to treat all payments made
by either of them to or for the benefit of the other under this Agreement as
adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to
the extent that the Applicable Tax Law of a particular jurisdiction provides
otherwise.   Section 5.4. Transfer Taxes.   All transfer Taxes arising in
connection with the transfer of the Shares shall be borne equally by Holdings
and the Buyer.   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE BUYER   The
obligations of the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the following conditions, except as the
Buyer may waive the same in writing.   Section 6.1. Performance. The

Warranties. The representations and warranties of the Companies, Holdings and
the Parent contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct on and as of
the Closing Date as if made on and as of such date (except to the extent that
any such representation or warranty has by its terms been made as of a
specific date in which case such representation and warranty shall have been
true and correct as of such specific date); provided, however, that if the
failure of any such representations and warranties to be true and correct on
and as of the Closing Date, individually or in the aggregate, has not
resulted or reasonably could not be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Companies, taken as a whole, disregarding for these purposes
any qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality in any such
representation or warranty, the foregoing condition shall be deemed to have
been fulfilled. For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect"
means any circumstance, change in or effect on any Person that, individually
or in the aggregate with any other circumstance, changes in or   
46     effects on, such Person, is, or could reasonably be expected to
be, materially adverse to the assets, business, operation, condition
(financial or otherwise), net worth, properties, liabilities, results of
operations or future prospects of the Companies or the Business; provided,
however, none of the following, to the extent arising after the date of this
Agreement, shall constitute a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any circumstance,

United States or world economy.   Section 6.3. Material Adverse Change.

liabilities, results of operations or future prospects of the Companies or
the Business, taken as a whole, and there shall not have been any occurrence,
circumstance or combination thereof (whether arising heretofore or
hereafter), including litigation pending or threatened, which might
reasonably result in any such material adverse change before or after the
Closing Date; provided, however, none of the following, to the extent arising
after the date of this Agreement, shall constitute a material adverse change

effect affecting generally companies operating in the insurance industry in
the same general manner and to the same general extent; or (ii) any
circumstance, change or effect affecting generally the United States or world
economy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a PIP Claim in the
amount of $3,000,000 (after factoring all of the associated tax impacts based
on a marginal tax rate of 35%) or more shall constitute a material adverse
change for purposes of this Section 6.3.   Section 6.4. Legal Opinion. Burr
and Forman LLP, as counsel to the Companies, Holdings and the Parent, shall,
immediately prior to the Closing, have delivered to the Buyer its legal
opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Buyer, in substantially

(b) be no litigation or proceeding pending against Holdings, either Company,
the Parent or the Buyer, which if decided adversely to such party would
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, there shall be no
governmental investigation or inquiry pending or threatened which might lead
to or result in any litigation or proceeding of the nature referred to in the
foregoing sentence.   Section 6.10. Governmental Approvals. Each of the
Companies, Holdings, the Parent and the Buyer, and any other person (as
defined in the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act")) required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to file a

Department of Justice and the FTC pursuant to Title II of the HSR Act shall
have made such filing and the applicable waiting period with respect to each
such filing (including any extension thereof by reason of a request for
additional information) shall have expired or been terminated. In addition,
the Buyer shall have prepared and filed with all necessary governmental
authorities a Notice on Form A and related documents, and such applicable
governmental entities shall have issued their approval with respect
thereto.   Section 6.11. Environmental Audit.   The results of any
environmental audit conducted pursuant to Section 4.16 shall not have

any of the Real Property which is not in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws or which otherwise requires remediation under

Buyer.   (b) By the Buyer (i) at any time if any representation and warranty
of the Companies, Holdings or the Parent contained in this Agreement was
incorrect when made or becomes incorrect at any time after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing Date and the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Companies, taken as a whole, disregarding for these purposes any
qualification or exception for, or reference to, materiality in any such
representation or warranty; (ii) at any time if the Companies, Holdings or
the Parent fails to comply in any material respect with any provision of

time if the Buyer fails to comply in any material respect with any provision
of Article IV binding upon it; or (iii) upon written notice to the Buyer
given on or at any time after March 31, 2006 if all the conditions precedent
set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Buyer have not been

this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) shall not in any way

other provisions of this Agreement prior to termination hereof.   ARTICLE
IX  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 9.1. Indemnifiable Claims.   (a)
Notwithstanding the execution of this Agreement and regardless of
any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Buyer or any
information the Buyer or any of its representatives or affiliates may have,
Holdings and the Parent, jointly and severally, will and hereby do indemnify
and hold the Buyer and any affiliate of the Buyer and their respective
officers and directors,    50     harmless from and against any and
all liability, claim, loss, cost, damage or expense whatsoever (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) resulting from
or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Companies, Holdings or the Parent contained herein or in any Transaction
Agreement (without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualification contained therein); or (ii) any breach of any covenant or
obligation of the Companies, Holdings or the Parent contained herein or in
any Transaction Agreement.   (b) The Buyer will and hereby does indemnify
and hold Holdings and the Parent harmless from and against any and all
liability, claim, loss, cost, damage or expense whatsoever (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) resulting from
or arising out of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Buyer contained herein or in any Transaction Agreement; (ii) any breach of
any covenant or obligation of the Buyer contained herein or in any
Transaction Agreement, including, without limitation, a breach of the
covenant to assume the liability of Holdings under the Sales Representative
Agreements in accordance with Section 4.22 hereof; or (iii) resulting or
arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from or out of the
conduct of the Business or operations of the Companies after the Closing
Date.   Section 9.2. Notice of Claim. If any action is brought against any
person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof (a
"Claimant") in respect of a claim under Section 9.1 hereof (an "Indemnifiable
Claim"), the Claimant shall notify promptly, if the Claimant is making a
claim pursuant to Section 9.1(a), the Parent, who is hereby authorized to act
on behalf of Holdings and the Parent as the representative of the
Indemnifying Parties (the "Representative") for purposes of this Section, or
if the Claimant is making a claim pursuant to Section 9.1(b), the Buyer (such
notified party or parties, the "Indemnifying Parties") in writing of the
institution of such action (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Parties from any liability the Indemnifying Parties may have
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Party). Unless otherwise agreed to by the Claimant, the Indemnifying Parties
shall assume and direct the defense of such action, including the employment
of counsel, and all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
defending or settling the Indemnifiable Claim shall be borne solely by the
Indemnifying Parties; provided, however, that such counsel shall be
satisfactory to the Claimant in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and
that the Indemnifying Parties shall not compromise any claim without the
prior written consent of the Claimant, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Parties shall undertake to
compromise or defend any such asserted liability, they shall promptly notify
the Claimant of their intention to do so, and the Claimant agrees to
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Parties and their counsel in the
compromise of, or defense against, any such asserted liability.
Notwithstanding an election by the Indemnifying Parties to assume the defense
of such action or proceeding, the Claimant shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding, and the Indemnifying Parties shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and shall pay such fees, costs
and expenses at least quarterly), if (a) the use of counsel chosen by the
Indemnifying Parties to represent the Claimant would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest; (b) the defendants in, or targets of,
any such action or proceeding include both a Claimant and an Indemnifying
Party, and the Claimant shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
legal defenses available to it or to other Claimants which are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Parties (in which case
the Indemnifying    51     Parties shall not have the right to direct
the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the Claimant); or (c)
the Representative shall authorize the Claimant to employ separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Parties. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with a Claimant\'s cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Parties. In any event, the Claimant shall have the right at its own expense
to participate in the defense of such asserted liability.   Section 9.3.
Limitation of Indemnification. Except for any willful or knowing breach or
misrepresentation, as to which claims may be brought without limitation as to
time or amount:   (a) Time Limitation. No claim or action shall be brought
under this Article IX for breach of a representation or warranty contained in
or made pursuant to this Agreement by any Indemnifying Party after the lapse
of two (2) years following the Closing Date. Regardless of the foregoing,
however, or any other provision of this Agreement:   (i) There shall be no
time limitation on claims or actions brought  for breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Companies,  Holdings or the Parent in
or pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6, and  Holdings and the Parent
hereby waive all applicable statutory limitation  periods with respect
thereto.   (ii) There shall be no time limitation on claims or actions
brought  for breach of any covenant or obligation of the Buyer pursuant to
Section  4.22, and the Buyer hereby waives all applicable statutory
limitation  periods with respect thereto.   (iii) Any claim or action
brought for breach of any representation,  warranty or covenant made by the
Companies, Holdings or the Parent in or  pursuant to Sections 2.18 or 2.23 or
relating to the Fair Credit Reporting  Act may be brought at any time until
sixty (60) days after the underlying  claim is barred by the applicable
period of limitation under any laws  relating thereto.   (iv) Any claim or
action relating to Taxes shall be subject to the  time limitation set forth
in Section 9.5 below.   (v) If any act, omission, disclosure or failure to
disclose shall  form the basis for a claim for breach of more than one
representation or  warranty, and such claims have different periods of
survival hereunder, the  termination of the survival period of one claim
shall not affect a party\'s  right to make a claim based on the breach of
representation or warranty  still surviving.   (b) Amount Limitation. A
Claimant shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to
claims unless the aggregate amount of all damages to the Claimant resulting
from such claims for which the Indemnifying Party would, but for the
provision of this Section 9.3, be liable to an Claimant exceeds $400,000 (the
"Basket Amount") in the aggregate, at which time all amounts of such damages
in excess of the Basket Amount may be recovered as provided in this Article
IX; provided, however, that the Basket Amount shall not be applicable to any
claims relating to intentional breaches by the Indemnifying Party,
any violation of the provisions of Section 4.11 or Section 4.22 or a claim by
Buyer for reimbursement under Section 4.17 relating to the Success Fee
Letters. The    52     aggregate liability of Holdings and/or Parent
to indemnify Buyer for breaches of representations and warranties under
Article II hereof shall not exceed an amount equal to $400,000,000; provided,
however, that any indemnified costs arising from taxes shall be dealt with
pursuant to Section 9.5 below.   Section 9.4. Right of Offset.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement, in the event an Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify or
make payments to any Claimant under any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement, in addition to any other right available to the
Claimant hereunder, the Claimant shall be entitled to offset the amount of
such required indemnity or any claim from any and all amounts owed by any
Claimant, or any affiliate of a Claimant, to any Indemnifying
Party, hereunder or otherwise.   Section 9.5. Tax Indemnification.   (a)
Scope of Tax Indemnity Provisions/Relationship of this Section to General
Provisions.   (i) In the case of any indemnity claim for Taxes, for a Pre-
Effective  Period, the indemnity obligations of Holdings and the Parent, and
the  rights of the Buyer with respect to indemnification, will be governed
by  this Section and not by the general indemnity provisions of this
Agreement.   (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the  indemnities provided for in this Section will survive until 60 days
after  the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation, including 
extensions.   (iii) An entity entitled to indemnification for Taxes under
this  Section shall also be entitled to indemnification for all fees and
costs  (including professional fees and costs) associated with enforcing
its  rights under this Section.   (b) Allocation of Liability for
Taxes.   (i) General.   (A) Subject to Section 9.5(b)(ii), below:   (1)
Holdings and the Parent, jointly and severally, will be  liable for, and will
indemnify, defend and hold  harmless the Companies, the Buyer, and their
respective  affiliates from and against, any and all Taxes imposed  on or
due with respect to any of the Companies, their  assets, or their operations
or activities for any  Pre-Effective Period. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, the liability of Holdings and the Parent will  include, without
limitation:    53      1) any liability for Taxes arising from the 
inclusion (or termination of the inclusion) of the  Companies in a
consolidated, combined, unitary or  separate company Tax Return filed by
Parent, either  Company or any of their respective tax affiliates, 
including, without limitation, all liability for Taxes  of any other member
of the Parent\'s affiliate group  pursuant to any provision of several
liability,  including Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 and any 
corresponding provisions of Applicable Tax Law;   2) any liability for Taxes
relating to the  demutualization, reorganization or other transactions  by
which the business (including the Business),  operations, properties or stock
of the Companies or  their respective affiliates were incorporated or 
acquired by affiliates or former affiliates of Holdings  and the
Companies;   3) any liability for Taxes arising out of any  Election made
in accordance with Section 5.2 of this  Agreement; and   4) any liability
for Taxes arising from the  disallowance or adjustment of deductions taken
for  periods prior to the Closing Date (regardless of the  year in which
such disallowance or adjustment occurs).   (2) The Companies and the Buyer
will be liable for, and  will indemnify, defend and hold Holdings and the
Parent  harmless from and against, any and all Taxes imposed on  or with
respect to the Companies or their assets,  operations, or activities for any
Post-Effective  Period.   (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein,  neither Holdings nor the Parent shall have any  indemnification
obligation:   1) with respect to Taxes of the Companies to the  extent of
the reserves for Taxes specifically  identified on Schedule 2.34;   
54      2) with respect to any Final Tax Allocation Amount  paid by the
Companies to Holdings or the Parent; or   3) with respect to Taxes shown on
Returns due on  or after the date of this Agreement that include only  the
Companies.   (ii) Method of Allocating Income and Deductions. In the case of
any  Straddle Period, Tax items will be apportioned between Pre-Effective 
Periods and Post-Effective Periods based on a closing of the books and 
records of the relevant entity or entities as of the Closing Date, provided 
that:   (A) any Tax item incurred by reason of the transaction occurring 
on or before the Closing Date as contemplated by this  Agreement will be
treated as occurring in a Pre-Closing Date  Period; and   (B) depreciation,
amortization and depletion will be apportioned  on a daily pro rata
basis.    55      Section 9.6. Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 9.6, from and after the Closing Date, except for a
willing or knowing breach or misrepresentation, the rights and remedies under
this Article IX shall be deemed to be exclusive of all other rights and
remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties hereto; that is,
each party hereto expressly waives the right, whether by contract or under
law to the extent legally permissible to do so, to seek damages from or
against or otherwise assert claims against the other party hereto or its
assets or its successors or assigns other than pursuant to this Article IX.
No course of dealing by either party, or any delay or omission of either
party in exercising any rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver of such right or remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto, shall have the right to enforce their respective
rights hereunder by an action or actions for specific performance, injunction
or similar equitable remedies, including, without limitation, as contemplated
in Section 4.11.   ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS   Section 10.1. Notices. Any
