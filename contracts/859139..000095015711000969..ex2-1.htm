ARTICLE IV 
 

  

  

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;

  

Exchange of Certificates

  

  

Section 4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

  

  

(a) Merger Consideration.

  

  

(i) Each share of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (a "Class A Share" or, collectively, the "Class A Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Class A Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and Class A Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (each, an "Excluded Class A Share," and collectively,
"Excluded Class A Shares"), and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive $43.875 per Share (the "Class A Per Share Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the Class A Shares (other than
Excluded Class A Shares owned by Safety National Casualty Corporation and
Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company of Texas ("Converted Class A
Shares")) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate formerly representing any of the Class A Shares
and any shares that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being
referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a "Class A
Certificate") formerly representing any of the Class A Shares (other than
Excluded Class A Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Class A Per Share Merger Consideration, the Pre-
Merger Special Dividend and any other dividends or distributions in accordance
with Section 4.2(c), in each case without interest.

  

  

(ii) Each share of the Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (a "Class B Share" or, collectively, the "Class B Shares," and
together with the Class A Shares, the "Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Class B Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of

wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties (each, an "Excluded Class B Share," and collectively, "Excluded
Class B Shares," and together with the Excluded Class A Shares, the "Excluded
Shares"), and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive $52.875 per Class B Share (the "Class B Per Share Merger
Consideration" and, the aggregate Class B Per Share Merger Consideration,
together with the aggregate Class A Per Share Merger Consideration and the
aggregate amount required to be paid in respect of Stock Awards pursuant to
Sections 4.3(a) through 4.3(d) (without duplication), the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the Class B Shares shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate formerly representing any of the Class B Shares and any shares
that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in
this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a "Class B Certificate", and
collectively with Class A Certificates, the "Certificates") formerly
representing any of the Class B Shares (other than Excluded Class B Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Class B Per Share Merger Consideration, the Pre-Merger Special Dividend and
any other dividends or distributions in accordance with Section 4.2(c), in
each case without interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 3 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) Treatment of Excluded Shares. At the Effective Time, each Converted Class
A Share shall be converted into .000018 shares of common stock, $1.00 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. All other Excluded Shares
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

  

  

(c) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 4.2. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to a paying agent which is a
U.S.-based commercial bank or trust company selected by Parent, and engaged
pursuant to an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time with the Company's
prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) (the "Paying Agent") in an account for the benefit of the holders
of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) and the
Options, RSUs, Restricted Shares and Stock Purchase Plan Awards (collectively,
the "Stock Awards"), amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
provided that any and all such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investors Service,
respectively or a combination of the foregoing or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in any such case, no such instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments
or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent (x) to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Class A
Per Share Merger Consideration or the Class B Per Share Merger Consideration,
as applicable, and (y) to mail to each holder of a Stock Award, a check in an
amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.3. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance
with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Class A Per
Share Merger Consideration or Class B Per Share Merger Consideration, as
applicable, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to
be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 4 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights to Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation is obligated
to pay (i) any dividends and make any other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the
Company on Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (to the
extent permitted under Section 6.1(a)) prior to the date of this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and (ii) the Pre-Merger Special
Dividend to the extent it remains unpaid after the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available
funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this
Article IV.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for 365 calendar days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Class A Per Share Merger Consideration or Class
B Per Share Merger Consideration as applicable (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates), without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

  

  

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a
reasonable amount, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Class A Per Share Merger Consideration or Class B Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 5 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(f) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand
and has properly demanded appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Stockholders") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Class A Per Share Merger Consideration or the Class B
Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable (the "Dissenting Shares"), but
instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL (or any successor provision) (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend and any other dividends or distributions in accordance with
Section 4.2(c) and the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn such demand or lost its, his or her rights to appraisal under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
holder's Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Class A Per Share Merger Consideration or the Class B Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, for each such Share, in accordance with Section
4.1, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal. Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands for appraisal; provided, however, that Parent shall
not enter into any settlement or make any commitment with respect to such
demands for appraisal that requires a payment or other action by the Company
prior to Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment or agree or commit to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Stock
Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving

remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

Section 4.3. Treatment of Stock Plans and Stock Awards.

  

  

(a) Treatment of Options. Except as set forth in Section 4.3(d) below, at the
Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option to purchase Class A Shares (a
"Class A Option") granted under a Stock Plan, vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Class A Option to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Class A
Shares subject to the Class A Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the
Class A Equity Award Consideration over the exercise price per Class A Share
under such Class A Option and (ii) each outstanding option to purchase Class B
Shares (a "Class B Option" and, collectively with the Class A Options, the
"Options") granted under a Stock Plan, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder of such Class B Option to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Class B Shares subject
to the Class B Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Class B Equity Award
Consideration over the exercise price per Class B Share under such Class B
Option.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Restricted Shares. Except as set forth in Section 4.3(d)
below, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall waive any
vesting or holding conditions or restrictions applicable to any Restricted
Shares granted pursuant to a Stock Plan, and such Restricted Shares shall be

in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Treatment of RSUs. At the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU granted
pursuant to a Stock Plan, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such RSU to receive with respect to each Share
subject to such RSU an amount in cash equal to, as applicable, (i) the product
of (x) the total number of Class A Shares subject to such RSU and (y) the
Class A Per Share Merger Consideration plus (ii) the product of (x) the total
number of Class B Shares subject to such RSU and (y) the Class B Per Share
Merger Consideration.

  

  

(d) Treatment of Performance-based Restricted Shares and Options. At the

outstanding Restricted Share and Class A Option, the vesting of which is

the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Performance Awards" and
individually, the "Performance Shares" and the "Performance Options"), shall
be deemed satisfied, but the time-based vesting conditions in respect of the
Performance Awards shall not be deemed satisfied at the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Performance Share shall automatically be
converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Class A Per
Share Merger Consideration, which will vest and be paid to holders thereof on
March 5, 2013, subject to continued employment with Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) through March 5, 2013,
and will otherwise retain the same terms and conditions (including, in the
event of certain terminations of employment, accelerated vesting and payment)
as contained in the original Performance Shares (but taking into account any
changes to such Performance Shares that are necessary to reflect the
provisions of this Section 4.3(d)). At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Performance Option shall automatically be converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Class A Shares
subject to the Performance Option times (y) the excess of the Class A Equity
Award Consideration over the exercise price per Class A Share under such
Performance Option, which will vest and be paid to holders thereof on December
31, 2012, subject to continued employment with Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) through December 31,
2012, and will otherwise retain the same terms and conditions (including, in
the event of certain terminations of employment, accelerated vesting and
payment) as contained in the original Performance Options (but, taking into
account any changes to such Performance Options that are necessary to reflect
the provisions of this Section 4.3(d)).

(e) Treatment of ESPP. Immediately prior to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend
Record Date, in the case of any outstanding purchase rights (the "Stock
Purchase Plan Awards") under the Company's 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan

and each participant's accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase
Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, (ii) such Shares
shall be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance with Section 4.1
of this Agreement and (iii) the ESPP shall terminate immediately after such
purchases.

Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections

that from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Shares, other capital stock of the
Company, or other compensation of any kind (other than amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Sections 4.3(a) through 4.3(e)) to any Person pursuant to or
in settlement of the Stock Awards and the Stock Plans will thereupon

Plan (the "2010 Directors Plan"), the Company Second Amended and Restated
Directors Stock Plan (and, together with the 2010 Directors Plan, the

changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Class A Per Share Merger

Representations and Warranties

  

  

Section 5.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as set
forth in the Company Reports filed on or after July 1, 2010 and prior to the
date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in the sections
titled "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements" or in any other section
to the extent the disclosure is a forward-looking statement or cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or otherwise disclosed to Parent in
the corresponding sections or subsections of the letter (the "Company
Disclosure Letter") delivered to it by the Company prior to the execution of
this Agreement (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) shall be deemed disclosure
with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such
disclosure to the applicable representation and warranty is reasonably
apparent and (ii) with respect to any disclosure of an item relating to a
representation or warranty in which the phrase "Material Adverse Effect"
appears shall not be deemed to be an admission that such item constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

  

(a) Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' certificates of incorporation and by-laws or
comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each
jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are organized.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 9 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

As of the date of this Agreement, the Company conducts its insurance
operations solely through the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.1(a)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Company Insurance
Subsidiaries"). Each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly
licensed or authorized as an insurance company in its jurisdiction of
incorporation, (ii) duly licensed or authorized as an insurance company in
each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or authorized,
and (iii) duly authorized in its jurisdiction of incorporation and each other
applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as being
written in the Company SAP Statements, and the Company has made all required
filings under applicable insurance holding company statutes, except where the
failure to be so licensed or authorized, or to make any such filings, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
insurance regulator in any state has notified the Company or any Company
Insurance Subsidiary, orally or in writing, that any Company Insurance
Subsidiary is commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction and, to the knowledge
of the Company, there are no facts that would result in any Company Insurance
Subsidiary being commercially domiciled in any state. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "knowledge of the Company" means the actual knowledge of
the individuals who have served since July 2011 and are serving as of the date
of this Agreement as the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel or
as any Executive Vice President of the Company or the Chief Executive Officer
of Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company or the Chief Executive Officer of
Safety National Casualty Corporation.

  

  

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Subsidiary" or "Company Subsidiary"
means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of which at least a
majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or other
persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
"Significant Subsidiary" is as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") and (iii) "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to the
Company means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, provided, that none of the
following shall constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or would be, a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 10 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United
States;

  

  

(B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate in the geographic
areas in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate;

  

  

(C) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries with its customers, employees, agents or suppliers
caused by the pendency or the announcement of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case to the extent that the Company reasonably
demonstrates that a causal relationship exists between such pendency or
announcement, on the one hand, and such change, on the other hand;

  

  

(D) changes in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United
States or Japan, SAP, the rules or policies of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, or any statute, rule, regulation or other Law unrelated to
the Merger and of general applicability, or interpretation of any of the
foregoing, after the date of this Agreement;

  

  

(E) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings
for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, provided that the exception in this clause shall not preclude a
determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying
such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company;

  

  

(F) the suspension of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") or a decline in the price of the Class A Shares on the NYSE, provided
that the exception in this clause shall not preclude a determination that any
change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such decline has
resulted in, or contributed to a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;

  

  

(G) any change or announcement of a potential change in the credit rating or
any other rating of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their securities; provided that the exception in this clause shall not
preclude a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development
underlying such change or announcement has resulted in, or contributed to a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and

  

  

(H) the entry into or announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement or compliance by the Company with the terms of this
Agreement;

  

  

provided that, with respect to clauses (A) and (B), such change, event,
circumstance or development does not (i) primarily relate to (or have the
effect of primarily relating to) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
(ii) disproportionately adversely affect the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in the same
lines of business within the insurance industry in which the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries operate.

A Shares and 20,000,000 Class B Shares, of which 54,859,158 Class A Shares and

December 16, 2011, and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share, none of which are outstanding. As of the close of business on
December 16, 2011, 2,182,716 Class A Shares and 227,216 Class B Shares were
held in treasury. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Other than 4,451,804 Class A
Shares and 3,386,854 Class B Shares reserved for issuance as of December 19,
2011 under the Stock Plans, the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance.
Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list as of December 19, 2011 of Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs,
including the holder, date of grant, number of Shares and, where applicable,
exercise or reference price and vesting schedule. All vesting thereunder will
be accelerated by either the Requisite Company Vote or the consummation of the
Merger. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and owned by the Company, or by a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance, other than a lien,
charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance for Taxes not
yet due (each, a "Lien"). Except as set forth above and except for securities
issued pursuant to the Stock Plans since December 19, 2011, as of the date of
this Agreement, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell
any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon
any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans,
such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on
any matter.

  

  

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary, (y) the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person, other than securities in a Person held for investment by

(iv) Neither Delphi Finance Trust I nor Delphi Financial Statutory Trust I has
any material assets or liabilities.

  

  

(c) Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness.

  

  

(i) Assuming the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section
5.2(i) are true and correct, the Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger, subject only to (A) adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote
(in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company at a stockholders'
meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "Requisite Company Vote"),
(B) adoption of the Certificate Amendment by the affirmative vote (in person
or proxy) of (x) the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and (y) the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding Class A Shares voting as a
single class (collectively, the "Certificate Amendment Approval"), (C)
approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A Shares not owned,
directly or indirectly, by holders of Class B Shares, any holder of Shares
that were transferred to such holder by any holder of Class B Shares after the
date of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, any officers or directors of the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or "associates" (as defined in
Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act)), voting as a single, separate class (the
"Unaffiliated Stockholder Approval," and, together with the Requisite Company
Vote and the Certificate Amendment Approval, the "Company Stockholder
Approvals") and (D) the filings and/or notices pursuant to Section 1.3. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equitable
principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").
"Affiliate" means, as to any Person, (i) any other Person that, directly or
indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with,
such Person. For the purpose of the definition of "Affiliate," "control" shall
mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of management or policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by
contract or otherwise and (ii) with respect to any natural Person, any member
of the immediate family of such natural Person.

(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the affirmative
recommendation of the Special Transaction Committee, has (A) (1) determined
that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
and approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting
Agreement, the Certificate Amendment and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and (2) resolved, subject to Section 6.2, to recommend that the
holders of the Shares relevant to voting on each Company Stockholder Approval
vote in favor of such Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company
Recommendation") and (B) directed that (1) this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (2) the Certificate Amendment be
submitted to holders of Shares and to holders of Class A Shares for their
approval. The Special Transaction Committee has resolved, subject to Section
6.2, to recommend that the holders of Shares relevant to voting on each
Company Stockholder Approval vote in favor of such Company Stockholder
Approval. The Special Transaction Committee has received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Lazard Freres and Co. LLC ("Lazard"), to the effect that,
subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein,
as of the date of such opinion, the Class A Per Share Merger Consideration,
together with the Pre-Merger Special Dividend, to be paid to the holders of
Class A Shares (other than holders of Excluded Class A Shares and any
Dissenting Shares and other than any holder of Class B Shares who also owns
Class A Shares) in connection with the Merger is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders of Class A Shares. It is agreed and understood that
such opinion is for the benefit of the Special Transaction Committee and the
other independent directors of the Company and may not be relied upon by
Parent or Merger Sub.

required to be obtained by the Company from, any federal, state, local or

body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity
(each a "Governmental Entity"), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the
failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and except for any such notices, reports or
filings which may have to be made by the Company with any Japanese
Governmental Entity, as to which the Company is not making any representation
or warranty.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 14 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation (giving
effect to the Certificate Amendment) or by-laws of the Company or the
comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries or any other entity
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns equity interests (not
including entities in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries invests in
the ordinary course of their respective investment operations) (an "Other
Entity"), (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on
any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, or other
legally binding arrangement (each, a "Contract") binding upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of
this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.1(d)(i) under any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the
case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,
default, creation, acceleration or change that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any termination of a reinsurance
or coinsurance agreement resulting from the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby described in Section
5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter will not affect the rights and
obligations existing under such agreement immediately prior to such
termination.

(the "Applicable Date") (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed
since the Applicable Date, including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein, and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the "Company Reports"). As
of their respective filing dates (or effective dates in the case of Company
Reports that are registration statements) or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment, the Company Reports did not,
and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading.

(ii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
other procedures are effective to ensure that material information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The Company maintains internal

are sufficient to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date
of this Agreement, to the Company's independent auditors and the audit
committee of the Company's Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified
for the Company's independent auditors and audit committee of the Company's
Board of Directors any material weaknesses in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent any such disclosure made by management to the Company's
independent auditors and the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors.

  

  

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by

fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income, consolidated statements of
the changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or,
in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will
fairly present in all material respects, the results of operations, retained
earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of such
companies for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited

(iv) The Company has previously furnished or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the annual statutory statements for each of the years ended

statutory statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and
September 30, 2011, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto
(collectively, the "Company SAP Statements"), with respect to each of the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries, in each case as filed with the Governmental
Entity charged with supervision of insurance companies of such Company
Insurance Subsidiary's jurisdiction of domicile. The Company SAP Statements
were prepared in all material respects in conformity with applicable statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by such Governmental Entity
("SAP") applied on a consistent basis, except as may have been noted therein
and present fairly, in all material respects, to the extent required by and in
conformity with SAP, the statutory financial condition of such Company
Insurance Subsidiary at the respective dates and the results of operations,
changes in capital and surplus and cash flow of such Company Insurance
Subsidiary for each of the periods then ended. The Company SAP Statements were
filed with the applicable Governmental Entity in a timely fashion on forms
prescribed or permitted by such Governmental Entity. No deficiencies or
violations material to the financial condition of any of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries, individually, whether or not material in the aggregate, have
been asserted in writing by any Governmental Entity which have not been cured
or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity (unless
not currently pending). The quarterly and annual statements of each Company
Insurance Subsidiary filed on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing ("Interim SAP Statements"), when filed with the applicable
Governmental Entities, including insurance regulatory authorities, of the
applicable jurisdictions, will present fairly in all material respects, to the
extent required by and in conformity with SAP, except as may be noted therein,
the statutory financial condition of such Company Insurance Subsidiary at the
respective dates indicated and the results of operations, changes in capital
and surplus and cash flow of such Company Insurance Subsidiary for each of the
periods therein specified (subject to normal year-end adjustments) and will be
filed in a timely fashion on forms prescribed or permitted by the relevant
Governmental Entity. The Company will deliver to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the Interim SAP Statements promptly after they are filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity in the domiciliary states. Since the
year ended December 31, 2009, the annual balance sheets and statements of
operations included in the Company SAP Statements have been audited by Ernst and
Young LLP. True, correct, and complete copies of the audit opinions relating
to such balance sheets and statements of operations have been furnished to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(v) There are no "off-balance sheet arrangements", as defined in Item 303 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party.

  

  

(vi) The aggregate reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but not
reported losses) and loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated or
unallocated), as reflected in each of the Company Reports and Company SAP
Statements, (A) were determined in all material respects in accordance with
generally accepted actuarial standards consistently applied (except as
otherwise noted in the financial statements and notes thereto included in such
financial statements); and (B) were computed on the basis of methodologies
consistent in all material respects with those used in computing the
corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as otherwise noted in
the financial statements and notes thereto included in such financial
statements).

(f) Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2010, (i) except as

occurrence, development or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company.

  

  

(g) Litigation and Liabilities. There are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings (collectively, "Proceedings") pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, to the knowledge of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, Other Entities) or (ii) except as reflected or reserved against in
the Company's consolidated balance sheets (and the notes thereto) included in
the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, obligations or
liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be disclosed, or any
other facts or circumstances to the knowledge of the Company that could
reasonably be expected to result in any claims against, or obligations or
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Other Entities,
including those relating to matters involving any Environmental Law, except
for those Proceedings, claims, obligations or liabilities that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company
as of the date of this Agreement, any of the Other Entities, is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or
award of any Governmental Entity which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Employee Benefits.

  

  

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies, arrangements or
understandings covering current or former officers, employees, agents or
consultants and independent contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Employees") and current or former directors of the Company, including
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and deferred
compensation, severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, stock based, incentive and bonus, phantom stock, vacation, disability,
death benefit, hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance, welfare, or
other employee benefit plan, agreement, policy, arrangement or understanding,
and any employment, consulting, change in control, termination, retention or
similar or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (the "Benefit
Plans") are listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter. True
and complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, including any trust instruments, insurance
contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan
agreements and subscription agreements forming a part of any Benefit Plans,
and all amendments thereto have been provided or made available to Parent
(provided, however, that with respect to such insurance contracts and loan
agreements and subscription agreements relating to the ESPP, there has been
provided a representative insurance contract, form of loan agreement and
subscription agreement; the other insurance contracts, loan agreements and
subscription agreements are substantially similar thereto), along with, to the
extent applicable: (A) any related funding instrument; (B) the most recent
determination letter or applicable opinion letter; (C) the most recent summary
plan description; and (D) the two most recent (1) Form 5500 and attached
schedules, (2) audited financial statements, and (3) actuarial valuation
reports. Each Benefit Plan which has received or submitted an application for
a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office,
including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. None
of the Benefit Plans is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan").

(ii) All Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance with, and have been
maintained, operated and administered in accordance and substantial compliance
with, their terms and with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each
Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension
Plan"), and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") covering all Tax Law changes for
which a determination letter is available, has applied to the IRS for such
letter covering all such Tax Law changes or is operated using a volume
submitter or prototype plan document that is the subject of an IRS opinion
letter regarding the form of such plan document, and the Company is not aware
of any circumstances that could result in the loss of the qualification of
such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees'
beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code
which provides benefits under a U.S. Benefit Plan has (i) received an opinion
letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section
505(c) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of circumstances likely to
result in the loss of such exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any ERISA Plan that could subject the Company or any
Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur a Tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  

  

(iii) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414(b) of the Code (x) maintains or contributes to, or has within the
past six years maintained or contributed to, a Pension Plan that is subject to
Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or (y) maintains or has an obligation to
contribute to, or has within the past six years maintained or had an
obligation to, contribute to a Multiemployer Plan or a "multiple employer"
plan, within the meaning of Sections 210(a), 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. All
contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the date of
this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the Company Reports.

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company threatened, litigation or other action or claim
relating to any of the Benefit Plans, other than routine claims for routine
benefits in the ordinary course of business. No Benefit Plan is under, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a notice of, any
audit or investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to a Benefit
Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits, except as required to avoid an excise tax
under Section 4980B of the Code. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or
terminate any Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability
thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or
termination.

  

  

(v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Benefit Plan which would increase the expense of maintaining such plan above
the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the execution of this
Agreement, stockholder or other approval of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any
Person to severance or other pay or any increase in such pay upon any
termination of employment or services after the date of this Agreement, (x)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent or any Affiliate to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans
or (z) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans, or payments to any
Employees or other Person, which would not be deductible under Section 162(m)
or Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

(vi) None of the Benefit Plans are maintained outside of the United States, or
are otherwise primarily for the benefit of Employees or other Persons working
outside of the United States.

  

  

(vii) There are no outstanding loans by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any of their current or former officers, employees or directors, other than
loans under any Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code and routine travel advances made in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

(i) Compliance with Laws; Licenses. The businesses (including the appointment
of Agents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and, to the knowledge
of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, the Other Entities) have not
been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local
or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation,
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency
requirement or published interpretation of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "Laws"), except for violations that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (i) each Company
Insurance Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, its Agents have
marketed, sold and issued insurance products in compliance with insurance Laws
applicable to the business of such Company Insurance Subsidiary and in the
respective jurisdictions in which such products have been sold, except for
such non-compliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company has not received since December 31, 2007
any written notice or communication of any material non-compliance with any
such Laws (which non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect) that has not
been cured as of the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and, to the knowledge of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement, the Other Entities) has obtained and is in compliance with all
permits, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity ("Licenses") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except those the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete
list of all pending market conduct examinations as of the date of this
Agreement by any Governmental Entity relating to any Company Insurance
Subsidiary.

(i) All of the material contracts of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
that are filed as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2010 or specifically referenced by name (and not by
category, type or class) in the Company SAP Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2010 (together with the Reinsurance Contracts set forth in
Section 5.1(j)(i)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the "Material
Contracts") are in full force and effect, except for those for which the
failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.1(j)(i)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of each material Reinsurance Agreement in effect as of the date
of this Agreement. True and complete copies of all Material Contracts have
been made available by the Company to Parent. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party to
the Material Contracts is in breach of or in default under any Material
Contracts, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which,
with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice, would constitute a
default thereunder by the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto or
by any other party thereto, except for such breaches and defaults (i) as are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to be materially
adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) that result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is party to any Contract containing any provision or
covenant limiting in any material respect the ability of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company (including, after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates) (A) to (i) sell any products or
services of or to any other Person or (ii) write, bind, renew or otherwise
solicit insurance business, (B) to (i) engage in any line of business, (ii) do
any business in any geographic location or (iii) compete with or to obtain
products or services from any Person or limiting the ability of any Person to

to acquire assets or securities of any other Person (any such contract,
together with any contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, a "Restricted Contract").

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 21 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) Each Material Contract is (assuming due power and authority of, and due
execution and delivery by, the other party or parties thereto) valid and
binding upon the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto (except as may be limited
by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), except for such failures to be valid
and binding as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

  

(k) Real Property.

  

  

(i) With respect to real property owned by the Company or any of its

Subsidiary has good and marketable fee simple (or equivalent) title to such
Owned Real Property, free and clear of any Lien, (B) there are no outstanding
written agreements or other Contracts to purchase, exchange, place a Lien
against, lease or otherwise transfer such Owned Real Property or any portion
of the Owned Real Property or interest therein, and (C) there are no material
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened condemnation or other
Proceedings relating to the Owned Real Property, except, in each case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(ii) With respect to the real property leased or subleased to the Company or
its Subsidiaries for which the annual base rent is over $200,000, the lease or
sublease for such property is valid, legally binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach of or default under such lease or sublease, and no event has occurred
which, with notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or permit termination,
modification or acceleration by any third party thereunder, or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except in each case, for such invalidity,
failure to be binding, unenforceability, ineffectiveness, breaches, defaults,
terminations, modifications, accelerations or repudiations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

(n) Taxes. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have prepared in good
faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of
them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material
respects; (ii) have paid or withheld in all material respects all Taxes that
are shown as due on such filed Tax Returns or that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are obligated to pay or withhold from amounts owing to any
employee, creditor or third party, except with respect to matters contested in
good faith; and (iii) have not waived any statute of limitations with respect
to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment

Company has made available to Parent true and correct copies of the United
States federal income Tax Returns filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries

information and other reporting, withholding and disclosure requirements under
the Code or any other applicable foreign, state and local Law, except to the
extent that any such failure to comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

meaning, the term "Taxes") includes all federal, state, local and foreign
income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, environmental, customs duty,

With respect to any reinsurance contracts to which the Company or any of its

circumstances or basis exists under which the IRS could make any reallocation,
recharacterization or other adjustment under Section 845(a) of the Code, or
make any adjustment arising from a determination that any reinsurance contract
had or has a significant tax avoidance effect under Section 845(b) of the
Code.

or other agreements or understandings with a labor union or labor organization
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which any of

consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not entitle any third party (including any labor union or labor
organization) to any payments under any of the Company Labor Agreements. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the
reporting requirements of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.

(r) Insurance Matters.

  

  

(i) To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2010 at the time each

Subsidiary ("Agent") wrote, sold or procured business for a Company Insurance
Subsidiary, such Agent was, at the time the Agent wrote or sold business, duly
licensed for the type of activity and business written, sold or produced. Each
of the Contracts between a Company Insurance Subsidiary and any Agent who has
sold, underwritten, or issued business for or on behalf of such Company
Insurance Subsidiary since January 1, 2009 is valid, binding and in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms, except such as would not,

Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, except as would

Material Adverse Effect, no Agent individually accounting for 1% or more of
the total gross GAAP premiums of all Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the
year ended December 31, 2010 has indicated to the Company or any Company
Insurance Subsidiary that such Agent will be unable or unwilling to continue
its relationship as an Agent with any Company Insurance Subsidiary within
twelve months after the date of this Agreement. To the knowledge of the
Company, as of the date of this Agreement, no Agent has been since January 1,
2009, or is currently, in violation (or with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would be in violation) of any term or provision of any Law
applicable to such Agent's writing, sale or production of insurance or other
business for any Company Insurance Subsidiary, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 26 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered or made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of any material actuarial reports
prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect to any Company
Insurance Subsidiary since January 1, 2010, and all attachments, addenda,
supplements and modifications thereto (the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). To
the knowledge of the Company, each Company Actuarial Analysis was based, in
all material respects, upon an accurate inventory of policies relevant to such
Company Actuarial Analysis in force for the Company Insurance Subsidiaries at
the relevant time of preparation.

  

  

(iii) The Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries have filed all
reports, statements, documents, registrations, filings or submissions
(including without limitation any sales material) required to be filed by any
of them with any Governmental Entity which regulates insurance matters since
January 1, 2010 in the manner prescribed by applicable Laws and Licenses, and
all such reports, registrations, filings and submissions were in compliance in
all material respects with applicable Laws and Licenses when filed or as
amended or supplemented, and no deficiencies have been asserted in writing by
any such Governmental Entity with respect to such reports, registrations,
filings or submissions that have not been remedied, except where such failure
to file, non-compliance or deficiencies would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any
written agreement, consent decree or memorandum of understanding with, or a
party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or directive by, or has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity
which restricts materially the conduct of the business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Company relates to any Company
Insurance Subsidiary's capital adequacy or risk management policies, nor has
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company been advised in writing by any
Governmental Entity since January 1, 2008 that it is contemplating any such
undertakings.

(s) Reinsurance and Coinsurance. To the knowledge of the Company, all
reinsurance or coinsurance ceded or assumed treaties or agreements, including
retrocessional agreements, under which any Company Insurance Subsidiary has
any material existing rights, obligations or liabilities ("Reinsurance
Agreements") are, as of the date of this Agreement, in full force and effect.
Copies of all Reinsurance Agreements renewed since January 1, 2011 have been
made available to Parent. Any termination of a Reinsurance Agreement resulting
from the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will not affect the rights and obligations existing under such
agreement immediately prior to such termination. Each Company Insurance
Subsidiary was entitled to take the credit that was taken by it in its Company
SAP Statements pursuant to applicable Laws for all reinsurance and coinsurance
ceded pursuant to any reinsurance or coinsurance treaty or agreement to which
such Company Insurance Subsidiary was a party as of the date of the applicable
Company SAP Statement. None of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party to a Reinsurance Agreement is in
default in any material respect as to any provision thereof, and no such
agreement contains any provision providing that the other party thereto may
terminate such agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In those instances in which a Company Insurance Subsidiary is a
cedent, neither the Company nor such Company Insurance Subsidiary has received
any written notice that the financial condition of any other party to any
Reinsurance Agreement is impaired with the result that a material default
thereunder may be reasonably anticipated, except in those instances in which
such default would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(t) Certain Reinsurance Agreement Issues. With respect to any Reinsurance
Agreement for which any Company Insurance Subsidiary is taking credit on its
most recent Company SAP Statements or has taken credit on any of its Company
SAP Statements from and after January 1, 2010, (i) there has been no separate
written or oral agreements between such Company Insurance Subsidiary and the
assuming reinsurer that would under any circumstances reduce, limit, mitigate
or otherwise affect any actual or potential loss to the parties under any such
Reinsurance Agreement, other than inuring to reinsurance contracts that are
specifically defined in any such Reinsurance Agreement, (ii) for each such
Reinsurance Agreement entered into, renewed, or amended on or after January 1,
2010, for which risk transfer is not reasonably considered to be self-evident,
documentation concerning the economic intent of the transaction and the risk
transfer analysis evidencing the proper accounting treatment, to the extent
required by SAP, is available for review by the respective domiciliary state
insurance departments for each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries, (iii)
each Company Insurance Subsidiary complies and has complied from and after
January 1, 2010 in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
SAP related to the credit taken and (iv) each Company Insurance Subsidiary has
and has had from January 1, 2010 appropriate controls in place to monitor the
use by it of reinsurance and comply with the provisions of SAP that are
relevant to such use.

  

  

(u) Forms and Rates. To the knowledge of the Company, all insurance contracts
and policies issued by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries and any and all
marketing materials related thereto are, to the extent required under
applicable Laws, on forms approved by the applicable Governmental Entity that
have been filed and, as appropriate, either approved or not objected to by
such Governmental Entity within the period provided for objection (the
"Forms") and such Forms comply with the Laws applicable thereto in all
material respects. With respect to premium rates established by the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries that are required to be filed with or approved by the
applicable Governmental Entity, the rates have been so filed or approved, the
premiums charged conform thereto, and such premiums comply with the Laws
applicable thereto in all material respects. All such insurance contracts,
policies and marketing materials comply with applicable Laws in all material
respects and have been administered by the Company Insurance Subsidiaries in
accordance with applicable Laws in all material respects and the terms of the
applicable insurance contracts in all material respects.

(v) Reports of Examination. The Company has made available to Parent with
respect to the Company Insurance Subsidiaries any material reports of
examination (including financial, underwriting, claims, market conduct and
similar examinations) issued (whether in draft, preliminary or final form) by
any Governmental Entity since January 1, 2007. None of the Governmental
Entities that noted any deficiencies or violations in such examination reports
has advised the Company or the applicable Company Insurance Subsidiary of any
intention to commence any regulatory proceeding or to otherwise take
disciplinary action against such Company Insurance Subsidiary based upon such
deficiencies or violations. No examination of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently pending or in progress.

  

  

(w) Investment Assets. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof a true and complete list of all securities and investment assets (the
"Investment Assets") held by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September
30, 2011, with information included therein as to the book value of each such
Investment Asset and the market value thereof as of September 30, 2011
(whether or not required by GAAP or SAP to be reflected on a balance sheet),
and copies of the investment guidelines of each Company Insurance Subsidiary
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on Section
5.1(w) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, all such
Investment Assets comply in all material respects with such investment
guidelines and in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of the
date of this Agreement, there has been no material change in the overall
composition of the Investment Assets held by the Company and its Subsidiaries
since September 30, 2011.

conducts activities of or is otherwise deemed under applicable Laws to be an
"investment advisor" as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(20) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" as defined under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

  

  

(y) Brokers and Finders. Neither the Company nor any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement
except that the Company has employed Lazard as the Special Transaction
Committee's financial advisor, and in that connection has agreed to pay Lazard
a fee upon closing of the Merger pursuant to an engagement letter (a true and
complete copy of which has been provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and accurate
copy of all agreements pursuant to which Lazard is entitled to any fees and
expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Affiliates, on the other hand, or (ii) in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and that is of a type that would have been required to be disclosed
in the Company's proxy statement for the Company's 2011 annual meeting of
stockholders pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

  

  

Section 5.2. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent

corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, existing,

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent

(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly
or indirectly, nor shall it authorize any of the officers and directors of it
or its Subsidiaries to:

  

  

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

  

  

(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or provide any non-public information or
data to any Person that has made, or to the knowledge of the Company is

\- 37 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, (A) the Company
may (1) provide information and data in response to a request therefor by a
Person who has made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the
Special Transaction Committee reasonably believes to be credible providing for
the acquisition of (x) more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis)
or (y) more than 50% of the voting power and more than a majority of the
number of outstanding Shares of the Company (or of the surviving entity in a
merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity) if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information or data an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms relating to confidentiality not significantly less restrictive to the
other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided
that such executed confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making, or
amendment, of any Acquisition Proposal to the Company); and promptly discloses
(and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information and data to
Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent or (2) engage in or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who
has made such an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that, prior to taking any action described in clause (1) or (2) above,
the Special Transaction Committee determined in good faith based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; and (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company may, if it has received the affirmative
recommendation of the Special Transaction Committee, approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal described in
clause (A) above if and only to the extent that the Special Transaction
Committee has determined in good faith based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Laws.

  

  

(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries with any Person other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or any controlled Affiliate thereof (a "Third
Party"), or (ii) any proposal or offer by any Third Party for an acquisition,
which, if consummated, would result in such Person becoming the beneficial
owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions,
20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of
the Company or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that would
result in any Third Party (or the stockholders of a Third Party) becoming the
beneficial owner (or owners), directly or indirectly, of (i) more than 50% of
the assets (on a consolidated basis) or (ii) more than 50% of the total voting
power and more than 50% of the number of outstanding Shares of the Company (or
of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity) that the
Special Transaction Committee has determined in its good faith judgment (x)
would result in a transaction that, if consummated, would be more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company than the Merger, taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) and the time likely
to be required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal, and (y) is reasonably
capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Proposal, including the
likelihood of termination and the existence of a financing contingency;
provided that the likelihood of the holders of Class B Shares voting in favor
of the adoption of, or otherwise supporting, an Acquisition Proposal shall not
be taken into account in determining whether an Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 38 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  

  

(i) Subject to Section 6.2(d), the Board of Directors of the Company and each
committee of the Board of Directors (including the Special Transaction
Committee) shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger, or
fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days
after receiving a written request to do so from Parent, or approve, recommend
or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to approve or recommend)
any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing, a "Change in Company
Recommendation").

  

  

(ii) The Company shall not, and the Board of Directors and the Special
Transaction Committee shall not cause or permit the Company to, and the
Company shall not cause or permit any Company Subsidiary to, enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.2(a)) relating to any
Acquisition Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  

  

(d) Change in Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Special Transaction Committee or the Board of
Directors of the Company may, prior to but not after the time the Company
Stockholder Approvals are obtained, make a Change in Company Recommendation if
the Special Transaction Committee has determined in good faith, after
consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; provided that neither the Special Transaction Committee nor
the Board of Directors may take any such action unless (1) if such Change in
Company Recommendation is in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) prior to making such
Change in Company Recommendation, the Company provides prior written notice to
Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Change in
Recommendation Notice Period") of its intention to take such action, which
notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, specify all material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal) and attach the most current version of any
documents evidencing such Superior Proposal, and any material modifications to
any of the foregoing, and, in any other case, specify in reasonable detail the
reasons for such action and (3) during the Change in Recommendation Notice
Period the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside
counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the
need for a Change in Company Recommendation (as determined in the good faith
judgment of the Special Transaction Committee after taking into account any
such amendments that Parent shall have agreed to make prior to the end of the
Change in Recommendation Notice Period); it being understood that any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of the Change in Recommendation Notice Period.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 39 -

deemed to prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure

Proposal; (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company determines that such
disclosure would be required under applicable Laws; or (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.2.

  

  

(f) Existing Discussions. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries, to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(g) Notice. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within two Business Days) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any information or
data in connection with an Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Company's intentions as previously notified.

  

  

Section 6.3. Proxy Filing; Information Supplied. The Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders
Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the "Proxy Statement"). The Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries,
that (i) the form of the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any
of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement (which, for this purpose, excludes any information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub) will, at the date of mailing to stockholders
of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

Section 6.4. Stockholders Meeting. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Laws and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the "Stockholders
Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, to
consider and vote upon the Company Stockholder Approvals, and shall not
postpone or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or as
approved in writing by Parent; provided that the Company may postpone or
adjourn such meeting, at the direction of the Special Transaction Committee,
until the sixth (6th) Business Day after the expiration of any Change in
Recommendation Notice Period or Termination Notice Period. Subject to Section
6.2 hereof, the Special Transaction Committee and the Board of Directors of
the Company shall recommend the adoption and approval, as applicable, of the
Company Stockholder Approvals and shall take all commercially reasonable
lawful action to solicit such adoption and approval.

request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all
comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon

done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger

consents, registrations, waivers, orders, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct
all matters with any Governmental Entity relating to the Parent Approvals
consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided that Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the material information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in

Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). The Company and Parent each shall
(subject to applicable Laws and the fiduciary duties of their directors)
consult with each other concerning the conduct of the defense of, and the
Company and Parent each shall have the right to participate in any settlement
discussions regarding, any Proceedings arising in connection with the

with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party
of any change, fact or condition that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or of any
failure of any condition to the other party's obligations to effect the
Merger. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any
other representatives or agents to participate in any live or telephonic
meeting with any U.S. Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry (other than for routine or ministerial matters)

other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by Law or by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

  

  

(e) Resolution of Objections. If any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any applicable Laws or if any suit
is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Laws,
each of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such applicable
Laws so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to
require Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, in order
to obtain any Company Approval or Parent Approval (other than any approval
from the JFSA) or otherwise, to (i) (A) sell, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such
action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to,
any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other

therein of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their
respective Affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other action or
agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with
respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective
Affiliates) if the actions of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii),
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect (a
"Negative Regulatory Action"); provided that any actions of the type described
in clauses (i) and (ii) above imposed on Parent or its Affiliates shall
constitute a Negative Regulatory Action if such action would, or would
reasonably be expected to, individually or when taken together with any other
actions of the type described in clauses (i) and (ii) above imposed on the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, have constituted a
Material Adverse Effect by reference to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Parent's and/or its Subsidiaries' officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein; and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require
the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that
in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this

designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

be a joint press release and, thereafter, the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto,

Section 6.9. Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Time, the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided
with cash compensation and pension and welfare benefits under employee benefit
plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees. To the extent
applicable, Parent will cause any employee benefit plans that the employees of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries are entitled to participate in
after the Effective Time to take into account for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, and level of benefits only for purposes of vacation, paid time off
and severance plans, thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits, service with the Company and its Subsidiaries as if
such service were with the Surviving Corporation, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary. With respect to any plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) adopted by the Surviving Corporation after

Corporation shall jointly and severally, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Laws (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Laws; provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each then present and former
director and officer of the Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification,
exculpation or advancement right of any Indemnified Party, and pertaining to
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have purchased (provided that
the Company shall not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such
coverage prior to the Closing, other than any such amounts advanced by Parent
to the Company prior to the due date for the payment of such amounts), and,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a tail
policy to the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained on the date of this Agreement by the Company (collectively, the
"Current Policy") from an insurance carrier rated at least "A+" by A.M. Best
with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies with respect
to any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby), which
tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through
and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain at least the same coverage
and amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
covered persons than the coverage currently provided by, the Current Policy;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company expend an aggregate
amount to purchase such tail policy that would be in excess of an amount equal
to 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company under the Current
Policy (the "Insurance Amount"); provided, however, that if the cost of such
tail policy would exceed the Insurance Amount, the Company shall be obligated
to purchase, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, a
tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Insurance Amount.

(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume, honor and comply with the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of, and are in addition
to, any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer
is entitled, whether pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or
the by-laws of the Company, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
6.11 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such
policies. The provisions of this Section 6.11 will survive the consummation of
the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
of the Indemnified Parties and his or her heirs. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the consent of such Indemnified Party, it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties are third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

Voting Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such
approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Takeover Statute on such transactions.

  

  

(b) Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Shares) that are treated as dispositions
under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

  

  

(c) Certificate Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
such actions as are necessary to file the Certificate Amendment with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware such that the same shall be in
full force and effect immediately prior to the Closing. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended (the "Certificate Amendment") by
adding the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph of Article
Fourth, Section A.7 thereof: "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing
limitation on distributions and payments shall not apply to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21,
2011, among Delphi Financial Group, Inc., Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. and TM
Investment (Delaware) Inc., as amended."

common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries
or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by
agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent)
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of
Merger Sub, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all
adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of
stockholders of Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

  

  

Section 6.14. Agreements With Shareholder Parties. Without the prior written
consent of the Company (and the Company shall grant such consent at the
direction of the Special Transaction Committee), prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, (a) amend or
otherwise modify, or agree to amend or otherwise modify, any Contract between
Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the Shareholder
Parties or their Affiliates, on the other hand, or (b) enter into, or agree to
enter into, any Contract between Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Shareholder Parties or their Affiliates, on the other hand, in
each case, only if any term of any such Contract would become effective prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.15. Pre-Merger Special Dividend. Prior to the Closing, subject to
applicable Laws, (a) the Company shall declare a cash dividend in the amount
of $1.00 per Share (the "Pre-Merger Special Dividend") to holders of record of
issued and outstanding Shares (including Performance Shares) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "Pre-Merger Special Dividend Record Date") and (b)
the Company shall provide that an amount equal to the amount of the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend shall be payable to the holders of RSUs in respect of each
Share subject to each such RSU as of the Pre-Merger Special Dividend Record
Date; provided that payment of the Pre-Merger Special Dividend and the amount
equal to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend referenced in clauses (a) and (b)
hereof shall be contingent on the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.16. Pre-Closing Restructuring. Section 6.16 of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists Company Subsidiaries that are no longer doing business
(each, a "Dormant Subsidiary"). Prior to the Effective Time, if Parent
provides a written request, the Company will cause each of the Dormant
Subsidiaries identified in Parent's request to be liquidated or dissolved (as
specified in Parent's request); provided that in no event shall the Company be
required to effect any such liquidation or dissolution if (a) such action
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the
Merger or (b) Parent fails to deliver its written request therefor
sufficiently in advance of the Effective Time such that it is reasonably
practicable for such liquidation or dissolution to be effective prior to the
Effective Time, taking into account any filing and/or approval requirements
under applicable Laws, reasonable preparation and documentation time and such
other factors as the Company reasonably determines are relevant. Pursuant to
the Contribution Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the
Company and TER II, LLC (the "Contribution Agreement"), prior to the Closing,
the Company will increase its economic ownership interest in TER II, LLC to
approximately (but in no event less than) 52% (as measured by reference to the
total members' equity of TER II, LLC).

5.1(z)(1) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case without any further
liability or obligation of the Company or the Surviving Corporation and, in
connection therewith, the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary) shall have
received from the other party to such Related Party Contract a release in
favor of the Company and its Affiliates from any and all liabilities or
obligations arising out of such Related Party Contract.

capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person that consists of 15% or more of the outstanding equity
interests (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity interests)
of such Person. The Company agrees that it will promptly notify Parent of any
other investment that consists of 15% or more of the outstanding equity
interests (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity interests)
of any Person that is not set forth in the list delivered to Parent pursuant
to this Section 6.18.

may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or terminating

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become

Special Transaction Committee determines, in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the stockholders of
the Company as the Superior Proposal; and (iv) the Company, prior to or
concurrently with such termination, pays to Parent the Termination Fee in

provided the notice to Parent required by clause (iii) above, (y) to notify
Parent promptly if its intention to enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement changes and (z) during the Termination Notice Period, to, and to
cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith should Parent propose to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Special Transaction Committee) a
Superior Proposal; it being further understood that any material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Termination Notice Period.

and warranty shall have become untrue, and (B) this Agreement is terminated
thereafter by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(d).

  

  

(c) If the Company is required to pay Parent a Termination Fee, such
Termination Fee shall be payable not later than two (2) Business Days after
termination of this Agreement (except with respect to Section 8.3(b) or
8.3(c), which shall be paid as set forth in Section 8.3(b) or 8.3(c)), in each
case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Termination Fee shall not be
payable to Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(iv), 8.5(b)(vi), 8.5(b)(vii) or
8.5(b)(viii) unless and until within 12 months of such termination the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a legally binding
Alternative Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has agreed to undertake, solicit stockholder approval for or
consummate, or shall have consummated, a transaction of the type referred to
in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" or, in the case of an Acquisition
Proposal made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer, shall have not
recommended that the Company's stockholders reject such tender offer or
exchange offer within the period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act (for purposes of this Section 8.5(c), substituting "48%" for "20%" in
clause (ii) of the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" and inserting
"pursuant to which such Third Party (or the shareholders of a Third Party)
would acquire, directly or indirectly, 48% or more of the total voting power
or more than 48% of the number of outstanding Shares of the Company (or of the
surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity)" at the end of clause
(i) of the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"); provided that for purposes
of this Section 8.5, an Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to have been
"publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a
legally binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the
consummation of, or shall have consummated, an Acquisition Proposal made by or
on behalf of such Person or any of its Affiliates or, in the case of an
Acquisition Proposal made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer by or on
behalf of such Person or any of its Affiliates, shall have not recommended
that the Company's stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer
within the period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

(d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 8.5 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for such
amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment
of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate of interest
published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or
any successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on
the date such payment was due, together with the reasonable costs and expenses
of Parent (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes
payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5, the
Termination Fee shall be Parent's and Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy
for monetary damages under this Agreement.

Section 9.7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto),
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated August 22, 2011, between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties
both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

  

  

Section 9.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the directors and
officers (and their heirs) referred to in Section 6.11 with respect to the
covenants in their favor referred to therein, the Parent and the Company
hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants
set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to recover, solely through an
action brought by the Company, damages from Parent in the event of a willful
or intentional breach of this Agreement by Parent, in which event the damages
recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of the Company's
stockholders and the holders of the Stock Awards shall be determined by
reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable by such
stockholders and holders if all such stockholders and holders brought an
action against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries
hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 58 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 9.9. Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires the Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on
the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and,
after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action.

  

  

Section 9.10. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Person that has
the primary legal liability for such Taxes.

  

  

Section 9.11. Definitions. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined
in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  

  

Section 9.12. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.13. Interpretation; Construction.

  

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Whenever the words "Class A Share," "Class B Share" or "Share" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to include Class A Restricted Shares,
Class B Restricted Shares or Class A and Class B Restricted Shares,
respectively.

  

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.14. Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation
of law or otherwise; provided, however, that Parent may, prior to the Company
Stockholder Approvals having been obtained, designate, by written notice to
the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary which is a
Delaware corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of
such designation; provided that any such designation shall not impede or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

  

  

Section 9.15. Dates and Dollar Amounts. All references to dates in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be references to dates in the United States, and
all references to "$" or "dollars" shall be references to United States
dollars.
