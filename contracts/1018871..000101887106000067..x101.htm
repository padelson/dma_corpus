prompt written notice thereof together with a statement of any reasonably available

relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to

notice to the Indemnified Party (the &#147;<B><I>Defense Notice</I></B><I></I>&#148;)

any provision herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
control, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim (x) to which the Indemnifying Party is also

legal counsel) that a material conflict exists as a result of the Indemnifying
Party&#146;s control over such proceedings, or (y) if the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that the Indemnifying Party has failed to defend the Third Party Claim actively
and in good faith. In the event that the Indemnifying Party is permitted to conduct the
defense of a Third Party Claim hereunder and does elect to conduct the defense of the
subject claim (subject to the conditions set forth herein), the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials
as may be reasonably requested by it (at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s cost), and the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense
assisted by counsel of its own choosing. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may enter into any
settlement of a claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless, as a result of
such settlement, injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief will be imposed
against the Indemnified Party, or if such settlement does not expressly unconditionally
release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such claim and all
other claims arising out of the same or similar facts and circumstances, with prejudice,
