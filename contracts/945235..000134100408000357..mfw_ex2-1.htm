"Estimated Net Working Capital Statement"), setting forth in reasonable
detail (including the components of such calculation) Seller's reasonable
good faith estimation of Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on
the expected Closing Date ("Estimated Net Working Capital"). The Estimated
Net Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the same
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements and in the calculation of the
Net Working Capital Target; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Estimated Net Working Capital Statement include any Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

(b) The amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than or
less than the Net Working Capital Target shall be referred to herein as the
"Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount".

 

 

2.5 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment on a dollar-for-dollar basis after the Closing Date as
set forth below.

 

 

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller an unaudited statement (the
"Closing Net Working Capital Statement"), which shall set forth the
Purchaser's calculation of Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time
on the Closing Date ("Closing Net Working Capital"). The Closing Net Working
Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the same accounting

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles, practices, methodologies and policies (including the
determination of reserves) used in the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements and in the calculation of the Net Working Capital Target;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities. After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its representatives with
any information reasonably requested by them and shall give them access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company for the purpose of its review of
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement in accordance with this Section
2.5.

 

 

 

(b) Upon receipt from the Purchaser, the Seller shall have 30 days to review
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement (the "Review Period"). If the
Seller disagrees with the Purchaser's computation of Closing Net Working
Capital, the Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a notice to the Purchaser (the "Notice of Objection"), which sets
forth its objection to the Purchaser's calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital; provided, however, that the Notice of Objection shall include only
objections based on (i) non compliance with the standards set forth in
Section 2.5(a) for the preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and (ii) mathematical errors in the computation of Closing Net
Working Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts
with which the Seller disagrees, together with a detailed written explanation
of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set
forth the Seller's calculation of Closing Net Working Capital based on such
objections. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, the
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with the Purchaser's calculation of all
other items and amounts contained in the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement. The parties hereto acknowledge that (x) the sole purpose of the
determination of Closing Net Working Capital is to adjust the Purchase Price
so as to reflect the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital and
the Estimated Net Working Capital and (y) the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital is to be made on a basis completely consistent with the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Target using the same accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies.

 

 

(c) Unless the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection to the Purchaser
within the Review Period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Purchaser's calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Net
Working Capital Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties hereto. If the Seller delivers the Notice of Objection to the
Purchaser within the Review Period, the Purchaser and the Seller shall,
during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Net
Working Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve their
disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable
to the Purchaser and the Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). If the
Purchaser and the Seller are unable to so agree, each shall select a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm and those two firms shall
select a third such firm, in which event "Independent Accounting Firm" shall
mean the third such firm. The parties shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm promptly to review this Section 2.5 and to determine solely
with respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to
what extent, if any, the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement requires adjustment. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall base its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination solely on written submissions by the Purchaser and the Seller
and not on an independent review. The Purchaser and the Seller shall make
available to the Independent Accounting Firm all relevant books and records
and other items reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm.
As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days after its
retention, the Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Purchaser and
the Seller a report which sets forth its resolution of the disputed items and
amounts and its calculation of Closing Net Working Capital; provided,
however, that in no event shall Closing Net Working Capital as determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm be less than the Purchaser's calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement nor more than the Seller's calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital set forth in the Notice of Objection. The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. After
final determination of Closing Net Working Capital, the Seller shall have no
further right to make any claims against the Purchaser in respect of any
element of Closing Net Working Capital that the Seller raised or could have
raised in the Notice of Objection. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each
pay their own costs and expenses incurred under this Section 2.5.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses
in accordance with the percentage which the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, bears to the amount actually contested by or on behalf of
such parties.

 

 

 

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Final Net Working Capital" means
the Closing Net Working Capital: (i) as shown in the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to
Section 2.5(a), if no Notice of Objection with respect thereto is timely
delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.5(b); or (ii)
if a Notice of Objection is so delivered, (A) as agreed by the Purchaser and
the Seller pursuant to Section 2.5(c) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Independent Accounting Firm's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(c). The Purchase Price shall
be increased by the amount by which Final Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital, and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by
the amount by which Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital. If, pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Purchase
Price is decreased, the Seller shall, and if the Purchase Price is increased,
the Purchaser shall, within five Business Days after the Final Net Working
Capital is determined, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, to an account designated in writing by the party receiving such
payment no later than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment,
the amount of such adjustment, together with interest thereon at a rate equal
to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank,
N.A. as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

 

 

(e) In the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earliest
date of final resolution of Final Net Working Capital and the adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.5, no changes made by the
Purchaser to the accounting methodology of the Business on which the Closing
Net Working Capital is to be based, shall have an impact upon the calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital or the calculation of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.5.

case may be, of each parcel of Leased Real Property and the Seller or one of
its Affiliates, as identified on Section 4.7(b) of the Seller Disclosure

Property. The Seller has not received or sent a notice of default under any
Lease which remains uncured, except where such default would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. All Leases are binding and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms and are in full force and effect. Immediately
after giving effect to the Reorganization and at the Closing, the Company
will be a lessee, sublessee or sub-sublessee, as applicable, of all of the

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under any option, right of first refusal or other contractual right to sell,
dispose of or lease any of the Real Property or any portion thereof or
interest therein to any Person (other than pursuant to this Agreement).
Neither the Seller nor its Affiliates, with respect to the Business, nor the
Company is a party to any agreement or option to purchase any real property
or interest therein.

 

 

 

(f) Neither the whole nor any portion of the Owned Real Property nor, to the
Seller's Knowledge, the Leased Real Property is subject to any Order
mandating the sale, condemnation, expropriation or taking by any Governmental
Entity with or without payment or compensation therefor, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, has any such sale, condemnation, expropriation or
taking been proposed.

 

 

(g) Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received any notice of,
or other writing referring to, any requirements or recommendations by any
insurance company that has issued a policy covering any part of the Real

have heretofore been made available to the Purchaser. The Seller has,
and immediately following the Reorganization and at the Closing, the Company
will have, all Authorizations required to use and operate the Real Property
as used and operated; and no such Authorizations will be required, as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be issued after
the date hereof in order to permit the Company, following the Reorganization,
to continue to use and operate the Real Property in the same manner in which
the Real Property is being used and operated in the conduct of the Business,
other than any such Authorizations that are ministerial in nature and are
normally issued in due course upon application therefor without further
action by the applicant.

 

 

(i) Each parcel of Owned Real Property has direct vehicular and pedestrian
access to a public street adjoining such Owned Real Property or has vehicular
and pedestrian access to a public street via an easement appurtenant to such
parcel of Owned Real Property, and such access is not dependent on any land
or other real property interest which is not included in the Owned
Real Property. None of the buildings, structures, fixtures, building systems
and equipment included in the Real Property or any portion thereof
are dependent for its access, use or operation on any land, building,
improvement or other real property interest which is not included in the
Owned Real Property, including its appurtenances.

 

 

(j) To the Seller's Knowledge, there is no physical defect on the Owned Real
Property which would adversely and materially impact the marketability of the

purposes as are currently used for the Business.

 

 

(k) The present uses of the Owned Real Property in connection with the
Business are in compliance with all applicable Laws, including all applicable
zoning Laws and with all registered deeds or restrictions of record affecting
such Owned Real Property, and the Seller has no Knowledge of any proposed
change therein that would materially and adversely

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect any of the Owned Real Property or its present use and the Seller has
no Knowledge of any violation of such Law or deeds or restrictions
of record.

Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to the Seller or its Affiliates.
No such claims have been asserted or threatened against any Person by the
Seller or its Affiliates in the past three years.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or where any default would not materially impair the Business, the Seller and
its Affiliates are not in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in any
Contract to which the Seller or its Affiliates are a party or otherwise bound
pursuant to which any third party is licensed or authorized by the Seller or

("Business Licenses") or pursuant to which the Business is licensed, or
otherwise authorized to use, Intellectual Property owned by a third Person
("Third Party Licenses").

 

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the conduct of the Business (including the products and services of the
Seller and Company) within the past three years has not infringed or
otherwise violated any Person's Intellectual Property

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights. As of the date hereof, there are no claims pending nor, to the

own, or license from third parties, any Business Intellectual Property.

 

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization and
this Agreement will not result in the material loss or impairment of or
payment of any material additional amounts with respect to, nor require the
consent of any other Person in respect of, the Company's right to own, use,
or hold for use any of the Intellectual Property integral to or used
principally in the conduct of the Business.

6.3 Resignations. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause to be delivered
to the Purchaser duly signed resignations, effective as of the Closing, of
all directors of their position as a director of the Company thereof;
provided, however, that no such resignation by any individual shall be a

6.4 Notification. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, each party
shall give notice to the other party of the existence or happening of any
fact, event or occurrence which, if existing or known as of the date hereof,

amend the Seller Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of (a) determining the
accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by the Seller in
this Agreement, or (b) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in
Section 9.2 have been satisfied. Delivery of notification pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party receiving such notice. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 6.4 to the contrary, any supplement to Section 4.13(b) of the

(c) The provisions of the covenant contained in Section 6.6(a) shall be
deemed to be a separate covenant in each of the states, cities, counties, or
other political subdivisions of the United States and all other countries.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, and other provisions
of Section 6.6(a) have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated,
commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time, scope and
other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances. The parties further
agree that if, at any time, despite the express agreement of the parties, a
court of competent jurisdiction holds that any portion of Section 6.6(a) is
unenforceable because any of the restrictions therein are unreasonable, or
for any other reason, such decision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement, and the
maximum restrictions of time or scope reasonable under the circumstances, as
determined by such court, will be substituted for any such restrictions which
are held unenforceable. In the event of a breach by any party of any of
the provisions of Section 6.6(a), the parties acknowledge that such breach
may cause irreparable damage to the Purchaser, the exact amount of which may
be difficult to ascertain, and the remedies at law for any such breach may
be inadequate. Accordingly, the Purchaser may be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled, in addition to any other rights or remedies existing in its favor,
to seek specific performance and injunctive relief in order to enforce or
prevent breach of any such provisions.

 

 

 

6.7 Non-Solicit. The Seller agrees that it shall not, for a period of one
year immediately following the Closing Date, directly or indirectly through a
Subsidiary or Affiliate, alone or with another Person, solicit, entice,
discuss or induce for itself or any other Person, the services or employment
of any Person who was an employee of the Business on the Closing Date;
provided, however, that advertisements by way of newspapers, magazines, trade
publications, internet or other general media or executive search not
specifically directed at any such Person shall not constitute the basis for a
violation of this provision.

 

 

6.8 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, the Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives shall hold in confidence all
information and documents relating to the Business, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company), except (i) as required by Law or
administrative process, (ii) information that is available to the public on
the Closing Date or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as
a result of a breach of this Section 6.8, (iii) information that is generally
available to or known by any Person operating in the same industry as the
Business, or (iv) information that is or becomes available to the Seller or
its Affiliates or their respective representatives on a non-confidential
basis from a third party source that is not prohibited from disclosing such
information to such Person.

committed borrowing facilities, (ii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms and conditions contemplated by the aforesaid documents and (iii)
enforce its rights thereunder. The Purchaser shall keep the Seller
reasonably apprised as to the status of the Financing (or any replacement
thereof) and shall promptly notify the Seller if it becomes aware of any fact
or circumstance that would make such Financing unavailable.

 

 

 

7.4 Credit Support Arrangements. The Purchaser shall (a) use commercially
reasonable efforts to replace each Credit Support Arrangement or (b) shall
assume all obligations of reimbursement under each Credit Support
Arrangement. The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

directly or indirectly, for reimbursement to the creditor in connection with
amounts drawn under a Credit Support Arrangement under the existing terms of
a Credit Support Arrangement. The Purchaser further agrees that to the extent
the beneficiary under any Credit Support Arrangement refuses to accept any
such substitute Credit Support Arrangement, the Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be,
against and reimburse Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, for any
and all costs or expenses in connection with such Credit Support Arrangement,
including the expenses in maintaining such Credit Support Arrangement whether
or not any such Credit Support Arrangement is drawn upon, and shall in any
event promptly reimburse the Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to
the extent any Credit Support Arrangement is called upon and the Seller or
its Affiliates, as the case may be, makes any payment thereunder or is
obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Credit Support Arrangement.

8.1 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Antitrust Clearance.

 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof and subject to
Sections 8.1(b), (c) and (d), each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take or cause to be taken all
actions, and to do or cause to be done all other things, necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Acquisition as promptly as practicable and (ii)
subject to Section 8.2, obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and effect all necessary registrations and filings.

 

 

(b) The Seller and the Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable and before
the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, file with any Governmental
Entity, other than the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice, any filings, reports, information
and documentation required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant
to any Antitrust Laws. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish
to each other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under and any Antitrust Laws and shall cooperate
with one another (i) in promptly determining which filings are required
to be or should be made or consents, approvals, or waivers are required to be
or should be obtained under any other federal, state or foreign Law or
whether any consents, approvals or waivers should be requested from other
parties to Contracts material to the Business

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in promptly making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking
to obtain timely any such consents, approvals or waivers.

 

 

 

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly obtain any clearance required under the HSR
Act and any other Antitrust Laws for the consummation of the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep each other apprised
of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Entity and shall comply
promptly with any such inquiry or request. In addition, the Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries shall contest, administratively or in court, any ruling,
order or other action of any Governmental Entity or any other Person under
any Antitrust Law or other applicable Law respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(d) The parties hereto shall instruct their respective counsel to cooperate
with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws at the earliest
practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation
include, but are not limited to such counsel's undertaking to (i) promptly
inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any
such filings or applications or any such transaction, and (ii) confer with
each other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of
such Governmental Entity. No party hereto shall independently participate in
any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
such filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted
by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate (which, at the request of any of the parties, shall be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only). Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the other party if such party becomes aware that any third
party has any objection to the Acquisition on antitrust or anti-
competitive grounds.

 

 

8.2 Consents. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers
with respect to the Acquisition and the Reorganization may be required from
parties to Contracts to which the Seller or its Affiliates is a party and
that such consents and waivers have not been obtained as of the date hereof.
Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents and waivers;
provided, however, that with respect to consents and waivers which are
required solely in connection with the Acquisition (as contrasted with the
Reorganization) such efforts shall not include any requirement of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) to expend money, commence,
defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party. If any such consent or waiver is
not obtained, then the Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in a
commercially reasonable manner to provide to the Purchaser the benefits under
such Contracts; provided, that such cooperation by the Seller (i) with
respect to consents and waivers which are required solely in connection with
the Acquisition (as contrasted with the Reorganization), shall be at the
Purchaser's cost and expense and (ii) shall not cause the Seller to violate
any terms of such Contract. Section 8.2 of the Seller

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Disclosure Schedule sets forth the consents or waivers which are required
solely in connection with the Acquisition (as contrasted with
the Reorganization).

 

 

 

8.3 Public Announcements. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall, without the approval of the other party,
issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; provided, however, that each party may make internal announcements
to its employees that are consistent with the parties' prior public
disclosures regarding the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

 

8.4 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay one-half of all Transfer
Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions effected pursuant
to this Agreement, provided, however, that the Seller shall pay or cause to
be paid, shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser from and against, any such Transfer Taxes, in addition
to any other Taxes, that are attributable to the Reorganization. The
Purchaser shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes, except for the filing of such documentation and such
Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes and any other Taxes attributable
to the Reorganization, which shall be the Seller's sole responsibility.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly control any Tax Claim with respect to
Transfer Taxes for which they are equally liable under this Section 8.4(a).

 

 

(b) The Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns required by Law to be filed by the Company, or which include the
Company or the Business or the Assets, for a Pre-Closing Period. The Seller
shall pay or caused to be paid, shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against, all Tax liabilities shown
by such Tax Returns to be due (other than to the extent of the amount of any
such liabilities included in the determination of Final Net Working Capital
pursuant to Section 2.5). The Seller shall have the sole right to file
amended Tax Returns with respect to the Company relating to Pre-
Closing Periods. The Seller shall retain any refunds received for Taxes
paid for Pre-Closing Periods with respect to the Company or the Business or
the Assets, along with any interest related thereto, and any such refunds
received by the Purchaser or the Company after the Closing shall be paid
promptly to the Seller, along with any interest related thereto.

 

 

(c) The Purchaser shall retain any refunds received for Taxes paid for Post-
Closing Periods with respect to the Company or the Business or the Assets,
along with any interest related thereto, and any such refunds received by the
Seller after the Closing shall be paid promptly to the Purchaser, along with
any interest related thereto.

 

 

(d) With respect to any Tax that is payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the amount of such Tax allocable to the period until the Closing Date
will be deemed equal to the Tax that would be payable if the tax period ended
with the Closing Date; provided, however, that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the case of a Tax imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Tax
allocable to the period until the Closing Date will be determined by
multiplying the Tax by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire taxable
period.

 

 

 

(e) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, provide to each of the other parties hereto such cooperation and
information as any of them reasonably may request in filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or
a right to a refund of Taxes or in conducting any audit or other proceeding
in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property,
which any such party may possess. Each party shall make its employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide
explanation of any documents or information so provided.

 

 

(f) The Purchaser will be responsible for any Pre-Closing Period Taxes of the
Company attributable to any action taken by the Purchaser, its Affiliates or
the Company from and after the Closing and outside the ordinary course of
business, unless such action is required by Law.

 

 

8.5 Procedures Relating to Tax Claims.

 

 

(a) If any Taxing Authority or other Person makes a Tax Claim, then the party
hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice of such Tax Claim to the other party hereto. Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall
include a copy of any relevant correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority or other Person.

 

 

(b) The Seller shall have the right to defend, object to or prosecute, at its
sole cost and expense, those Tax Claims relating to Pre-Closing Periods of
the Company or the Business or the Assets. In order to defend, object to
or prosecute any such Tax Claim, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser that
it elects to defend, object to or prosecute such Tax Claim (such notice, an
"Election Notice") within 30 days after (i) the date on which the Seller
receives notice of any such Tax Claim from the Purchaser (with respect to Tax
Claims as to which the Purchaser first received notice from a Taxing
Authority or any other Person), or (ii) the date on which the Seller
delivered to the Purchaser notice of any such Tax Claim (with respect to Tax
Claims as to which the Seller first received notice from a Taxing Authority
or any other Person). The Seller may in its discretion settle or compromise
any Tax Claim as to which the Seller has provided an Election Notice to the
Purchaser; provided, however, that if the results of such Tax Claim could
reasonably be expected to have a material Tax cost to the Purchaser, the
Company or their Subsidiaries for any Tax period including or ending after
the Closing Date, then the Seller shall not settle or compromise such Tax
Claim without the Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Purchaser or its authorized
representatives shall be entitled, at the expense of the Purchaser, to attend
but not participate in or control, all proceedings relating to such Tax
Claim. Whether or not the Seller has assumed the defense of a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tax Claim, the Seller will not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Seller's prior written consent, such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 

 

(c) If, with respect to any Tax Claim related to a Pre-Closing Period, the
Seller fails to deliver an Election Notice to the Purchaser within the period
provided in Section 8.5(b), then the Purchaser shall have the right to defend
or prosecute such Tax Claim, at its sole cost and expense or, if the
Purchaser incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the
Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of
Section 8.4, at the expense of the Seller. The Purchaser shall have full
control of such defense or prosecution and such proceedings, except that the
Seller: (i) shall have the right to participate in the defense or
prosecution, and such proceedings, at its sole cost and expense; (ii) may at
any time thereafter assume the defense of such Tax Claim, in which event the
Seller shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Purchaser's
counsel incurred prior to the assumption by the Seller of the defense of such
Tax Claim; and (iii) shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to
without the Seller's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 

8.6 Purchase Price Allocations.

 

 

(a) The parties shall treat for U.S. federal income tax purposes the purchase
and sale of the Interests provided for in Article II as a purchase and sale
of all of the assets of the Company and an assumption of all of the
liabilities of the Company. The Purchase Price shall be allocated, in
accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code, and the Treasury
regulations thereunder, among the assets of the Company for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and the parties agree not to file any Tax Return or
otherwise take any position for tax purposes that is inconsistent with
such allocation.

 

 

(b) The Purchaser shall present a draft of the allocation (the "Proposed
Allocation") to the Seller for review within 270 days after the Closing Date,
but in no event later than January 1, 2009. Except as provided in Sections
8.6(c) and (d), within 30 days following the delivery of the Proposed
Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become final and binding.

 

 

(c) The Seller shall raise any objection to the Proposed Allocation in
writing within 30 days of the delivery of the Proposed Allocation. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
differences for 30 days after delivery of any objection by the Seller. If the
Purchaser and the Seller reach written agreement amending the Proposed
Allocation, the Proposed Allocation, as amended by such written agreement,
shall become final and binding.

 

 

(d) If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot mutually agree on the allocation
within the 30-day time limit set forth in Section 8.6(c), the Purchaser and
the Seller shall submit all remaining disputes to the Independent Accounting
Firm for resolution. The Purchaser and the Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such disputes
within 20 days of its appointment, and the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination with respect to any such disputed item shall be final and
binding. The fees and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally between
the Purchaser and the Seller.

 

 

 

8.7 Employment Matters.

 

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall transfer the employment
of all of the Business Employees to the Company, and shall cause the Company
to employ the Business Employees, under terms and conditions of employment
that are the same in all material respects as those in effect immediately
before such transfer of employment. No provision of this Agreement will
create any third party beneficiary rights to any person, including, without
limitation, any Business Employee, any representative of a Business Employee,
or any dependent of such a Business Employee, including, without limitation,
with respect to continued employment or resumed employment, employee benefits
or any other matter.

 

 

(b) With respect to the Business Employees, the Purchaser agrees: (i) for
the 18-month period following the Closing Date, to provide cash compensation
levels and employee benefits, without regard to equity compensation, which
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those made available to
such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) to waive or
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable insurers to waive
any limitations regarding pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods under any plan that provides for medical benefits maintained by the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates for the benefit of such Business
Employee; (iii) for all purposes (excluding benefit accruals under defined
benefit pension plans) under all benefit plans of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including, but not limited to, any plan that provides for
vacation, paid-time-off or severance benefits, in which such Business
Employee is eligible to participate, to treat all service by the Business
Employee provided to the Business before the Closing Date as service provided
to the Company, the Purchaser and their Affiliates, provided that
the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits; and (iv) to
recognize any unused sick, vacation or personal leave days that such Business
Employee has accrued as of the Closing Date for purposes of the vacation plan
or policies of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

 

(c) Without limiting the scope of Section 8.7(b), should the employment of
any Business Employee be terminated by the Purchaser or its Affiliates during
the 18-month period following the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide such
Business Employee severance payments and benefits in an amount no less than
that to which the Business Employee would have been entitled pursuant to the
terms of the Severance Pay Plan set forth in Section 8.7(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule applicable to such employee immediately prior to the
Closing (taking into account both pre-Closing and post-Closing service
performed by such Business Employee, and without regard to the ability of the
plan administrator thereunder to reduce the severance levels).

 

 

(d) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller has entered into
retention/severance agreements and arrangements (the
"Retention/Severance Agreements") with certain Business Employees, as listed
on Section 8.7(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For the purposes of
clarity, the Seller shall not assign to the Company as part of the
Reorganization, and shall otherwise remain solely responsible for and pay to
such Business Employees as and when due any obligations or liabilities
relating to, such agreements and arrangements; provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Purchaser shall be responsible for severance payments and benefits
which would otherwise be payable to such Business Employees pursuant to
Section 8.7(c) of this Agreement in the absence of the
Retention/Severance Agreements.

 

 

 

(e) Upon or as soon as practicable after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
cause to be maintained for the benefit of the Business Employees a defined
contribution plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
which includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Purchaser's 401(k) Plan"). As soon as
practicable thereafter, and if requested by a Business Employee, the Seller
or one of its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to initiate
a transfer of eligible rollover distributions as defined in section
401(a)(31) of the Code, from the tax-qualified 401(k) plan maintained by the
Seller or its Affiliates in which the Business Employees participate, to the
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan, and the Purchaser shall cause its 401(k) Plan to
accept such rollover. Individual account balances shall be valued as of
the date of transfer, and the transfer shall be in cash or in kind, as
determined by the Seller, except that outstanding loan balances shall be
transferred in the form of notes or other documentation evidencing
such loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser may mutually
agree following the date hereof, but prior to the Closing, to provide for a
trust-to-trust transfer of the account balances of Business Employees under
the 401(k) Plan maintained by the Seller to the Purchaser's 401(k) Plan.

 

 

(f) The Seller shall remain solely responsible for, and neither the Purchaser
nor the Company shall be responsible for any health, disability or workers'
compensation claims in respect of the Business Employees (or their
beneficiaries and dependents) based on or arising out of facts,
circumstances, actions or events occurring on or before the Closing Date, but
only to the extent not properly accrued or reserved for in the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital, with all such claims so properly reserved or
accrued to be assumed by the Company from and after the Closing. Workers\'
compensation claims based on or arising out of facts, circumstances, actions
or events occurring on or before the Closing Date which by statute are
covered under the Insurance Policies shall be administered by the Seller
under the terms and conditions of those policies and adjusted by the
appropriate third party administrator appointed by the Seller to manage such
claims. Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall relieve the
Purchaser of responsibility for the cost of claims that it has otherwise
assumed pursuant to this Section 8.7(f).

 

 

(g) The Purchaser shall cause the Company to be responsible for the provision
of "COBRA" coverage under part 6 of Title I of ERISA with respect to the
Business Employees for "qualifying events" occurring after the Closing.

 

 

(h) The Purchaser shall cause the Company to assume and maintain the Seller's
bonus plan in respect of the Business Employees as described in Section
8.7(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and pay bonuses thereunder (the
"Business Employee Bonuses") in respect of the full calendar year in which
the Closing occurs in the amounts and manner that such bonuses would have
been payable had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.7, neither the Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall adopt, become a sponsoring employer of, or
have any liabilities or obligations with respect to the Seller Benefit Plans.

 

 

8.8 Worker Notification.

 

 

(a) On or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide a list of the
names and sites of employment of any and all Business Employees who have
experienced, or will experience, within 90 days prior to the Closing Date, an
employment loss or layoff, as defined by the WARN Act or any similar
applicable state or local Law requiring notice to employees in the event of a
closing or layoff. The Seller shall update this list up to and including
the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) None of the Seller, the Company or their Affiliates shall, at any time 90
days before the Closing Date, without complying fully with the notice
requirements and other requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate (i) a plant
closing as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment or one or
more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the
Business; (ii) a mass layoff as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of
employment of the Business; or (iii) any similar action under the WARN Act
requiring notice to any Business Employee in the event of an employment loss
or layoff.

 

 

8.9 Further Action.

 

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date each of the Purchaser and the Seller
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may be
reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. After the Closing, all cash and other remittances, mail and
other communications relating to the Assets or the Business received by the
Seller or its Affiliates shall be promptly turned over to the Purchaser by
the Seller. After the Closing, all cash and other remittances, mail and other
communications relating to any business of the Seller not included within the
Business being purchased by the Purchaser hereunder that are received by the
Purchaser shall be promptly turned over to the Seller by the Purchaser.

 

 

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the date hereof, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain all books and records of the Business relating
to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall make them, and
any individuals responsible for the preparation and maintenance of such books
and records, available to the Seller as reasonably requested. If at any time
after the Closing, the Seller requires a copy of any such book or record, it
shall have the right to promptly obtain a copy thereof (at the Seller's cost)
from the Purchaser.

 

 

8.10 No Use of Names. Except as specifically permitted by the Trademark
License Agreement, the Purchaser shall cause the Company promptly, and in any
event within 90 days after the Closing Date, to (a) revise newly produced
print advertising and product labeling to delete all references to the Names,
(b) change signage and stationery to delete all reference to the Names, and
(c) otherwise discontinue use of the Names; provided, however, that for
a period of 120 days after the Closing Date, the Company may continue
to distribute product literature and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other Business materials that use the Names and distribute products with
labeling that use the Names to the extent that such product literature and
other business materials and products exists or are in process on the
Closing Date. Within 30 days following Closing the Purchaser shall
take reasonable steps to mark, or to cause the Company to mark, such
product literature and such labeling to obliterate the Names. Except
as specifically permitted by the Trademark License Agreement, in no event
shall the Company use any Names after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose materially different from the use of either or both of such Names by
the Business, as the case may be, during the 90-day period preceding the
Closing Date. As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall cause the Company to file applications to amend or
terminate any certificate of assumed name, d/b/a, or equivalent foreign
filings. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the name of the Company (in each
case, to the extent it makes use of the Names) to be changed to a name that
does not include the Names and is not confusingly similar to the Names.
Nothing in this Section 8.10 shall (i) preclude any uses of the Names by the
Company that are required by Law or any uses of the Names that are in
reference to the Acquisition or that qualify as "fair use," under applicable
Law regarding Intellectual Property or any internal or non-public operational
uses including references to the Names in parts or labels not visible absent
product or equipment dismantling or historical, tax and similar records, or
(ii) require the Purchaser to modify the Names of products or services
produced and provided or committed to customers of the Company prior to
Closing.

 

 

 

8.11 Intellectual Property Matters. Prior to or, to the extent that such
action prior to the Closing Date is not practical, promptly following the
Closing Date, the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, cause the
Company to effect the necessary change of ownership and recordals with all
patent, trademark, and copyright offices and domain name registrars and other
similar authorities where Business Owned Intellectual Property that is
included in the Assets is still recorded in the name of the Seller or of
legal predecessors of the Company or any Person other than the Company.
Promptly, but in no event more than five Business Days, following the Closing
date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement of the Business
Owned Intellectual Property which has not yet been recorded in the name of
the Company.

 

 

8.12 Insurance Matters

 

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that coverage under all of the Insurance
Policies will terminate with respect to the Business and the Company
effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date and that such
termination shall not constitute a breach of Section 4.16 or 6.1.

 

 

(b) To the extent that the Seller shall be entitled under the terms and
conditions of any "occurrence" based third-party Insurance Policy in effect
on the Closing Date to coverage for Losses suffered after the Closing arising
out of any occurrences covered by such policies occurring prior to the
Closing, at the request of the Purchaser, and following the approval by the
Purchaser of the Seller's good faith estimate of the out of pocket costs of
the Seller to be incurred in prosecuting any claim in respect of any such
occurrence (the "Approved Costs"), the Seller shall use such commercially
reasonable efforts to recover such losses pursuant to such policies as it
would use or take in conducting the Business in the ordinary course if such
losses were suffered by the Seller, and shall deliver the net proceeds
thereby recovered as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

promptly as practicable (after recovery by the Seller of any out of pocket
costs incurred in prosecuting any such claim up to the applicable Approved
Costs for such claim) to either the Purchaser or the Company, as specified by
the Purchaser; provided, however, that the Seller may immediately cease the
prosecution of any claim upon incurring costs in prosecuting such claim equal
to or greater than 90% of the Approved Costs for such claim if the Purchaser
has not approved additional amounts of costs for such claim within five
Business Days upon receipt of such a request from the Seller, unless and
until the Purchaser approves an additional amount of such costs, which
additional amount shall increase the Approved Costs for such claim. In the
event of any dispute regarding the date of any loss or occurrence, the terms
of the applicable policy shall govern. Following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall provide, and shall cause the Company to provide, Seller with all
records and other information necessary for the reporting, investigation,
negotiation and, if applicable, prosecution of any claim made by the Seller
pursuant to this Section 8.12(b).

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(i) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

 

 

(ii) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if the Closing does not occur on or
before the first anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(a)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has
been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Outside Date; for avoidance of doubt, the Outside Date shall be
extended until the issuance of any final and non-appealable Order enjoining
the consummation of the Acquisition;

 

 

(iii) by the Purchaser if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a),
(b) or (c) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured
by the Outside Date;

 

 

(iv) by the Seller if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.3(a),
(b) or (c) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured
by the Outside Date; or

 

 

(v) by either the Purchaser or the Seller if a Governmental Entity shall have

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

11.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement and any certificate or other document provided
hereunder or thereunder will terminate at the Closing, except that the
representations and warranties made in Articles III, IV and V shall survive
in full force and effect until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and
provided that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.2 (Authority and Enforceability), 3.4 (Interests), 4.17 (Brokers), 5.2
(Authority and Enforceability) and 5.7 (Brokers) shall survive indefinitely,

Section 4.15 (Environmental) shall survive until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date (the representations listed in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 11.1 being referred to as the
"Specified Representations"). Any representation or warranty that
would otherwise terminate in accordance with the preceding sentence will
continue to survive if a Claim Notice shall have been timely given under this
Article XI on or prior to such termination date until the related claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in
Article XI, but only with respect to matters described in such Claim Notice.
The covenants and agreements which by their terms do not contemplate
performance after the Closing shall terminate as of, and not survive, the
Closing, except that claims for indemnification with respect to any breach
thereof prior to the Closing shall survive until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date. The covenants and agreements which by their terms contemplate
performance after the Closing and expire upon a date certain shall survive
until such date certain, except that claims for indemnification with respect
of any breach thereof prior to such date certain shall survive until the
first anniversary of such date certain. The covenants and agreements which do
not expire upon a date certain shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their terms.

 

 

11.2 Indemnification by the Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and defend the
Purchaser and its Affiliates and any of their respective former, current and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, the
"Purchaser Parties"), and shall hold the Purchaser Parties harmless from, any
loss, liability, claim, charge, action, suit, proceeding, assessed interest,
penalty, damage, cost or expense (including the reasonable fees and costs of
attorneys accountants, experts and other advisors), or Tax (collectively,
"Losses") resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by the Purchaser in
connection with (a) any breach of any representation or warranty (with such
representation or warranty being read for this purpose without regard to any
qualifications or limitations relating to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar expressions), covenant or agreement of the Seller contained
in this Agreement and/or (b) the Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

 

11.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, following the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the
Seller and its Affiliates and any of their respective former, current and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, members, managers, general or limited
partners or assignees (collectively, the "Seller Parties"), and shall hold
the Seller Parties harmless from, any Loss resulting from, arising out of, or
incurred by the Seller in connection with (a) any breach of
any representation or warranty (with such representation or warranty being
read for this purpose without regard to any qualifications or limitations
relating to materiality, Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or similar
expressions), covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement and/or (b) the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

11.4 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims.

 

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing
of such Third Party Claim (such notice, a "Claim Notice"), provided that
the failure to give such notice will not affect the indemnification
obligations set forth herein except to the extent (and only to the extent)
that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Claim
Notice shall state in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the Third
Party Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, as well as the basis
for indemnification sought. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim
Notice a copy of all relevant papers served with respect to such Third Party
Claim, if any, and any other documents evidencing such Third Party Claim.

 

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall have 45 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor
desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and
any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole
cost and expense. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim
in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at
its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim (provided, however, that if, at the advice of outside counsel to the
Indemnitee, there exists a material conflict of interest which would make it
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel of
its choosing at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided that the Indemnitor
shall under no circumstances be obligated to pay or reimburse all Indemnitees
in respect of Third Party Claims or series of related Third Party Claims for
the fees or expenses of more than one separate counsel), but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof;
(ii) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (A) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes
an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the
Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) if
the settlement imposes equitable remedies or material obligations on the
Indemnitee other than financial obligations for which such Indemnitee will be
indemnified hereunder (excluding amounts not indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 11.6(a)), or (C) if the result is to admit civil or criminal
liability or culpability on the part of the Indemnitee or that gives rise to
criminal liability with respect to the Indemnitee. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims,
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents
relevant thereto. If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnitor's prior written consent.

 

 

 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within 45 days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be
entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense (or, if the
Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 or 11.3,
as applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice to
such effect to the Indemnitor; provided, however, that: the Indemnitor (i)
shall have the right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim
at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall control the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof and (ii) may at any time
thereafter assume defense of the Third Party Claim, in which event the
Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the
Indemnitee's counsel incurred prior to the assumption by the Indemnitor
of defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitee assumes the defense
of such Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 11.4, it may defend such
claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and may settle such claim on
such terms as it may deem appropriate; provided, however, that in settling
any action in respect of which indemnification is payable under this Article
XI, it shall act reasonably and in good faith.

 

 

11.5 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. The Indemnitee
will notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does
not involve a Third Party Claim (provided that the failure to give such
notice will not affect the indemnification obligations set forth herein
except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced by such failure), which Claim Notice shall state
in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and the amount
thereof, to the extent known, as well as the basis for indemnification
sought. In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee that
it disputes such claim within 60 days from receipt of such Claim Notice, the
claim specified therein shall be deemed a liability of the Indemnitor
hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI, as
applicable). The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such

11.6 Limitations on Indemnification.

 

 

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
pursuant to this Article XI: (i) unless and until the aggregate Losses of (A)
the Purchaser, in the case of any such breaches by the Seller, or (B) the
Seller, in the case of any such breaches by the Purchaser, exceed one and
one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price, after which such party shall
be liable only for such Losses in excess of such amount; and (ii) for any
individual items or aggregated items arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances where the Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000.00;
provided that the limitations set forth in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii)
shall not apply to any Loss resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in
connection with the breach of a Specified Representation other than Section
4.15 (Environmental).

 

 

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, under this
Article XI in the aggregate exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price
(the "Cap"); provided that the limitations set forth in the immediately
preceding clause shall not apply to any Loss resulting from, arising out of,
or incurred in connection with (A) the breach of a Specified Representation
(other than Section 4.13 (Employee Benefits) or Section 4.15
(Environmental)), (B) the breach of a covenant or agreement that contemplates
performance after the Closing or (C) any Excluded Liability.

 

 

(c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article XI by the Indemnitor
shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under
insurance policies or from any other Person.

 

 

(d) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any covenant or condition waived in writing by the other party
on or prior to the Closing or (ii) any consequential or punitive damages,
unless such damages are recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim, or
(iii) any Loss with respect to any matter specifically resolved as part of
the Final Net Working Capital adjustment process pursuant to Section 2.5.
Each party hereto agrees that, for so long as such party has any right
of indemnification under Article XI, it shall not, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that their Affiliates do not,
voluntarily or by discretionary action, accelerate the timing, or increase
the cost of any obligation of any other party under this Article XI, except
to the extent that such action is taken (x) for a reasonable legitimate
purpose and not primarily with a purpose of discovering a condition that
would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement of the other party hereto or (y) in response to a discovery by such
party, without violation of the immediately preceding clause (x), of
meaningful evidence of a condition that constitutes a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any other party hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Article XI,
with respect to any claim for indemnification regarding any breach of
any representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.15 relating to
the investigation or remediation of actual or alleged contamination of the
Owned Real Property: (i) the Seller's indemnification obligation shall
be limited to the cost of the least restrictive standard or remedy acceptable
under applicable Environmental Law (including engineering or institutional
controls) based on the industrial use of the relevant facility or property
taking into account the protection of the environment and human health and
safety, provided, that the use of such standards or engineering or
institutional controls does not interfere in more than a de minimis manner
with operations at the affected facility; and (ii) if any contamination at
any Owned Real Property that is subject to indemnity by the Seller is
exacerbated due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Purchaser or the Company after the Closing Date, to the extent such
exacerbation increases the cost of the investigation or remediation of such
contamination, the Seller shall not be responsible for any such increase in
costs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser and the Company shall retain the right to control all
matters subject to indemnification hereunder relating to compliance with
applicable Environmental Law at the Owned Real Property, including matters
relating to the investigation or remediation of contamination at or migrating
from such properties.

 

 

11.7 Exclusive Remedy. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that,
should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all matters arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement,
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be a claim pursuant to the provisions of this Article XI; provided that
the provisions of this Section 11.7 shall not apply (a) in the case of
intentional fraud or willful misrepresentation on the part of the Seller or
the Purchaser or (b) to the indemnification provided for in Section 8.4.

 

 

11.8 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall treat
any indemnification payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

commercially reasonable efforts to send any notice or communication via
electronic mail; provided that such electronic mail not shall not constitute

notice delivered in accordance with this Section 12.1. Any party hereto may
change the address to which notices, requests and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties hereto notice in
the manner set forth herein.

 

 

12.2 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless such amendment is in writing and signed by the
Purchaser and the Seller. No failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 

 

12.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party
hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties, whether or not the Acquisition is consummated; provided that,
the Purchaser shall be responsible for one-half and the Seller shall be
responsible for one-half of all filing fees payable in connection with
filings made under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws, and for any local
counsel fees associated with any filings under other Antitrust Laws.

 

 

12.4 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by either
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party; provided,
however, that without such prior consent, the Purchaser shall have the right
to (a) assign all or any part of its right, title, interest or obligations
hereunder to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Purchaser and (b)
collaterally assign all or any part of its right, title, interest or
obligations hereunder to any of its financing sources, provided in each case
that the Purchaser remains liable for its obligations hereunder
notwithstanding a permitted assignment. Subject to the foregoing sentence,
all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

 

12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

 

12.6 Guarantee. The Seller Parent unconditionally guarantees the performance
when due by the Seller of all of the Seller's obligations under this
Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller Parent
hereby waives all defenses of a surety or guarantor to which

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it may be entitled. The Seller Parent hereby waives notice of all of
the Seller's obligations and the acceptance of this guaranty by
the Purchaser. The Seller Parent hereby waives protest, presentment, demand
for payment, notice of default or non-payment and notice of dishonor. This
shall be a continuing guaranty and the Purchaser shall not be obliged to
exhaust its recourse against the Seller or any guaranty or security that it
may hold before being entitled to performance from the Seller Parent of the
obligations hereby guaranteed. This is a guaranty of payment and not merely
collection. This guaranty is irrevocable. The Seller Parent further agrees
that in the event any payment made by the Seller under this Agreement in
respect of any obligation of the Seller hereunder is recovered from, or
repaid by, the Purchaser, in whole or in part in any bankruptcy, insolvency,
or similar proceeding instituted by or against the Seller, this guaranty
shall continue to be fully applicable to such obligation or be reinstated to
the same extent as though the payment so recovered or repaid had never been
originally made on such obligation. The Seller Parent agrees that it will not
exercise any rights of subrogation that it may acquire due to its payment of
an obligation of the Seller unless and until the Purchaser shall have been
paid in full hereunder. In the event that the Seller Parent shall receive
any payment on account of such rights of subrogation while any portion of
the obligations guaranteed hereby remains outstanding, the Seller Parent
agrees to pay all such amounts so received to the Purchaser to be applied to
the payment of the obligations payable hereunder. The Seller Parent
hereby represents and warrants that (i) it is duly organized and validly
existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all
necessary power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to enter into the
guaranty set forth in this Agreement and to carry out its obligations under
this guaranty and (ii) the guaranty contained in this Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Seller Parent, and this guaranty constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller Parent enforceable against
the Seller Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally.

 

 

 

12.7 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or Federal court located within the
County of New York in the State of New York for the purposes of any suit,
action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, and agrees to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding only in such courts. Each party further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party's
respective address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for
any such action, suit or proceeding. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

 

12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Agreement is
intended or shall be deemed to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

12.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(including the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto and thereto) constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or between the parties hereto, written or oral, with
respect to such subject matter (except for the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall, subject to Section 7.1, continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms). All Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are
intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement.

 

 

12.11 Captions. All captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

12.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights
or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by such provision or its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such
provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such provision
as may be possible.

 

 

12.13 Interpretation. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof.
