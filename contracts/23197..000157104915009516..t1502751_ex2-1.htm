Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject only to: (i) there

Condition_ "); and (iii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub,

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the
Termination Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or
Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, in each case, as of the Expiration
Date, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or promptly (within the
meaning of Section 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act) after the applicable
Expiration Date. Subject to _Section 2.10(h)_, the Offer Price payable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not

to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless previously approved by the
Company in writing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer
Price other than pursuant to _Section 2.09(e)_, (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change the number of shares of
Company Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) waive the Minimum
Condition, the Termination Condition or the other Offer Conditions set
forth in clause (b) or clause (c)(1) of _Annex I_ , (v) add any condition to

modify, supplement or amend any other term or condition of the Offer in a
manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

the Offer shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, as
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act (such time
and date, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or if the Initial Expiration

Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, on the date to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later time and date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

  



  

(e) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, if as of any then scheduled Expiration Date, (i) any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) has not been satisfied or, to
the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, waived by Parent or Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten
(10) Business Days each (or such longer period of up to twenty (20) Business
Days if Parent so desires and the Company consents in writing prior to such
extension), the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its
reasonable discretion in order to permit the satisfaction of any such Offer
Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) in no event shall Parent or
Merger Sub extend the Offer for a period that expires more than three (3)
Business Days following the end of the Marketing Period without the Company's
prior written consent and (y) Merger Sub shall be required to extend the Offer
pursuant to this clause (i) only if in the reasonable discretion of Parent
any such Offer Condition is capable of being satisfied on or prior to the
End Date, (ii) all of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition)
have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for an extension
period of ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period of up to twenty (20)
Business Days if Parent so desires and the Company consents in writing prior
to such extension), in order to permit the satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) in no event shall Parent
or Merger Sub extend the Offer for a period that expires more than three (3)
Business Days following the end of the Marketing Period without the Company's
prior written consent and (y) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer pursuant to this clause (ii) on more than two (2) occasions, but
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to do so, and (iii) Merger
Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period or periods required by
applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions
of the SEC or its staff or the NASDAQ Global Market; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Merger Sub (x) be required to extend the Offer
beyond the End Date, unless at such time Parent would be prohibited from
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ , or (y) extend
the Offer beyond the End Date or more than three (3) Business Days following
the end of the Marketing Period without the Company's prior written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 2.01(e)_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01_.

  



  

(f) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) promptly terminate the Offer and shall not acquire the
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated
by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the Acceptance Time,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly return, and
shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock
that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the registered holders
thereof.

in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by all
applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. Unless the Board of Directors of
the Company has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 5.02_ , Parent, Merger Sub and their legal
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9
before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration
to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Merger Sub and their legal counsel (it being understood that Parent, Merger
Sub and their legal counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). In addition, unless the Board of Directors of the
Company has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with  _Section 5.02_ , the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
legal counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its (or the Special Committee's) legal
counsel may receive from time to time

from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours) after receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section
5.02_ , Parent, Merger Sub and their legal counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any proposed written or oral responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their legal counsel and,
to the extent practicable, to participate in any substantive telephonic
communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto.

  



  

(b) _Company Information_. From time to time as reasonably

available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities
positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in
each case as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Merger
Sub such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance in communicating with the record and beneficial owners of
the shares of Company Common Stock as Merger Sub may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, will use such information only in connection with such transactions
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, promptly (and

information then in their possession or control.

  



  

(c) _Acceptance Time_. The Company shall register the transfer of
shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment effective

actions to cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as reasonably
practicable without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company as permitted

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Company Common Stock_. Each
outstanding or issued share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or

or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plan_ "),

on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled in consideration for the right
to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (x)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such canceled
Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of

or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be canceled in
exchange for no consideration and (2) such Option Payments may be reduced
by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section

amounts payable hereunder, the " _Restricted Share Payments_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Restricted Share Payments may be reduced by the amount
of any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10(h)_. The
Restricted Share Payment which a former holder of a Restricted Share may be
eligible to receive shall be earned subject to the same vesting schedule and
other vesting terms and conditions (including any applicable acceleration
provisions, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent and selected holders
thereof in writing with respect to acceleration provisions relating to certain
specified employment or other service termination rights) which applied to
such holder's Restricted Share as of the Effective Time, and such Restricted
Share Payment shall become payable, less any required Tax withholdings, on the
date or dates that such Restricted Share would have become vested under the
vesting schedule in place for such Restricted Share as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

Stock, such shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.09(c)_.

  



  

(iv) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any
resolutions (copies of which shall be provided to Parent in advance of the

any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, business combination, tender or exchange offer,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period,
the Offer Price and the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount
payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.10_ after giving effect to any such
event exceed the amount that would have been payable pursuant to _Section
2.10_ had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in this _Section 2.09_
shall permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities
that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as provided in _Section
2.09(c)_. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying
Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing. Prior to or at the Closing,
Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available
funds in the amount necessary for payment in accordance with _Section 2.09_
and this _Section 2.10_ of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in _Section

the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights
with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein. From and
after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason (other
than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares) shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares pursuant to this _Article 2_.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As soon as possible after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and which letter
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled. Upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount of cash in immediately available funds equal to (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10(h)_), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more
Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agent's message" in customary form (or such other documentation or evidence,
if any,

  



    

22 
--- 

 



    



  

as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10(h)_), and the Book-
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry
Shares.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains unclaimed for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parent's election), and
any holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws). 

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, agent, representative or Affiliate thereof, shall be
liable to any Person in respect of the Per Share Merger Consideration from
the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Per Share Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation); 
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in funds investing solely in such obligations
that provide for same day liquidity. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parent's election). To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payments of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment
Fund required so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required
by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any Person such amounts
as such party reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other agreements entered into in connection with the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

(i) _No Dissenters ' or Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters' or
appraisal rights or rights of an objecting stockholder (under Section 3-201
et seq. of the MGCL or otherwise) shall be available with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 2.11. Further Assurances. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized
to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its properties and the conduct of its
business require such qualification, licensing or good standing, except where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or

is in compliance in all material respects with such Organizational Documents.

  



  

Section 3.02. Authority.

Section 3.06. Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

  



  

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and
other information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed or
furnished by the Company under the Securities Act and Exchange Act since
January 1, 2013 (such documents, collectively with any documents filed or
furnished during such period by the Company to the SEC on a voluntary basis,
any exhibits and schedules to any of the foregoing documents and other
information incorporated therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). Each of
the Company SEC Documents, as of the time of its filing or, if applicable, as
of the time of its most recent amendment, complied in all material respects

  



    

28 
--- 

 



    



  

with, to the extent in effect at such time, the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in each case,
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, applicable to
such Company SEC Document, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed
or, if amended, as of the date of such most recent amendment, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No principal executive officer of the Company has failed in
any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section
302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Document
and, at the time of filing or submission of each such certification, the
statements contained in each such certification were complete and correct in
all material respects. Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated
financial statements (including the related notes and schedules thereto and
capital stock line items included in the balance sheets therein) of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents (or incorporated therein by
reference) complied at the time it was filed or, if amended, as of the date
of such most recent amendment, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing or
amendment, had been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC)
and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to
normal period-end audit adjustments that are not material in amount). Except
as set forth in Section 3.06(a) of the Disclosure Letter, (i) to the
Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of
ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC investigation and (ii) there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any of the
Company SEC Documents. None of the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC. 

  



  

(b) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and all such material information is made known to the
Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The
Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
internal controls are reasonably sufficient in all material respects
to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board of Directors of the Company, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's and its Subsidiary's assets that could have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The
Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and

  



    

29 
--- 

 



    



  

audit committee (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls which would be reasonably
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in internal controls. 

  



  

(c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company has
not extended or maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or
renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any
executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) or director of the Company in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made
by the Company to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act).

  



  

Section 3.07. No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature
required by GAAP to be reflected in a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries except for (a) those reflected or reserved
against in the Company Balance Sheet, (b) liabilities and obligations
incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (c) liabilities and obligations
arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (d)
liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

supplied by or on behalf of the Company expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents (and any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto), will not, when filed with the SEC, when distributed or
disseminated to the Company's stockholders, and at the Expiration Date,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9, and all amendments and
supplements thereto, and any other document required to be filed with the SEC
or required to be distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's
stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, and will not, when filed with the SEC, when distributed or
disseminated to the Company's stockholders, and at the Expiration Date,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in
this _Section 3.08_ will not apply to statements or omissions included
in the Schedule 14D-9 or any other document filed or distributed by the
Company based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Parent
or Merger Sub specifically for use therein.

(a) Assuming that the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter, the proceeds contemplated to be provided by the Debt
Letters, together with cash on hand, cash equivalents, available lines of

Merger Sub, will be sufficient to (a) pay the aggregate Offer Price and the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (b) satisfy all of their other

be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

complete copies of (i) an executed commitment letter (as amended,
modified, supplemented, replaced or restated in accordance with the terms
hereof, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), dated as of November 22, 2015, between
Parent and/or Merger Sub and the Financing Sources set forth in the Commitment
Letter and (ii) an executed fee letter (as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or restated in accordance with the terms hereof and as redacted to
remove the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" and other economic terms, the " _Redacted Fee Letter_ "), dated
as of November 22, 2015, between Parent and/or Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources set forth in the Redacted Fee Letter, in each case,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Letters_
"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
Financing Sources have committed to provide Parent and/or Merger Sub with debt
financing (the " _Financing_ "). The Commitment Letter has not been amended
or modified in any manner on or prior to the date of this Agreement and, as
of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated (except to implement or exercise the "flex"
provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to the Financing and
to add additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof).
The Commitment Letter, including the commitments contained therein, has not
been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect on or prior
to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of
Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is
contemplated. Parent has paid or cause to be paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees and amounts in connection with the Commitment
Letter that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and the
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, as of the
date hereof the other parties thereto, except that (i) such enforcement
may be subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions and (ii) the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of
the

  



    

46 
--- 

 



    



  

date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment Letter to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party that could impose conditions to the
funding of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter delivered to the Company prior to
the execution of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach by Parent or,
to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letter and Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by
Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent
at the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to
any financing or funding by any third party. As of the Effective Time, after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing and the payment of any amounts required to
be paid pursuant to Article II, the repayment, redemption, discharge or
refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub and the
payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Financing), Parent shall be solvent and able to pay its debts as they
come due.

nor Merger Sub nor any of their "affiliates" (as defined in Section 3-601 of
the MGCL) is an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 3-601 of the
MGCL) of the Company.

  



  

Section 4.09. Brokers. The Company will not be responsible for
any broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other fee or commission
payable to any broker, finder, financial advisor or other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

Section 4.10. No Other Representations or Warranties; Independent
Investigation.

_Article 4_, the Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates or with respect to any other information provided to
the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company expressly disclaims any and all other
representations and warranties, whether express or implied.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent
review and analysis of the business, operations, technology,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and acknowledges and agrees that each of

rights of any Party to this Agreement in respect of fraud.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a beneficiary.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.02(a)_ , but subject to _Section 5.02(c)_ , at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and under circumstances not
otherwise involving a breach of this _Section 5.02_ that the Board of
Directors of the

Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, determines
in good faith (after consultation with its (or the Special
Committee's) financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company and
its Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that all such non-public information (to the extent that such
non-public information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours) with the provision or making
available of such non-public information to such Person and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, in the case of
each of (A) and (B), if the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its (or the Special Committee's) outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but
in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would be
reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be
provided orally and in writing and shall identify (i) the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (including
any financing arrangements to the extent provided to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), (ii) the identity
of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and (iii)
a copy of any written materials provided by such Person in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis with respect to any material
change to the status or details of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request (and in any event within 24 hours following any changes to such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request), including by providing copies of
any materials received by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives relating to such Acquisition Proposal after written
notice of such Acquisition Proposal is delivered to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 5.02(c)_.

  



  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor the Special
Committee shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify) in any
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail
to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (iii) approve,
adopt, declare advisable, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
publicly propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable, endorse or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (iv)
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, (A) in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal
that has not been withdrawn, the Board of Directors of the Company, acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may (1) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition

Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_ (and pay the Company Termination Fee due in connection with
such termination), or (B) if an Intervening Event has occurred, the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in the case each
of clauses (A) and (B), if the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, has concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its (or the Special Committee's) financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section 5.02(d)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_
unless it has first (x) caused the Company to provide Parent at least five
(5) Business Days' prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal / Intervening Event_ "),
which notice shall (I) state that the Company has received a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event has occurred and that it intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01(e)_, (II) specify the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including any financing arrangements to the extent provided
to the Company and/or its Representatives), or the material facts and
circumstances (based on information reasonably available) related to such
Intervening Event, (III) in the case of a Superior Proposal, identify the
Person making such Superior Proposal and (IV) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, enclose copies of all materials provided by such Person in
connection with such Superior Proposal (or any Affiliate of such Person), (y)
during such five (5) Business Day period following delivery of the Notice of
Superior Proposal / Intervening Event, provided Parent a reasonable
opportunity to make any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that Parent
proposes in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event (the "
_Modified Terms_ ") and caused the Company and its Representatives to
negotiate, to the extent Parent so wishes to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives concerning such Modified Terms, and (z) after
complying with subclauses (x) and (y) of this _Section 5.02(d)_, concluded in
good faith, after considering the Modified Terms (if any are proposed by
Parent) proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent in a signed
writing or signed email and consulting with its (or the Special Committee's)
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.02(d)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_ would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.02_, and the Company
shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours of occurrence) notify Parent
of any such new Acquisition Proposal, provide Parent with the
information contemplated by clauses (II) through (IV) of clause (x) of this
_Section 5.02(d)_ with respect thereto and the Parties shall comply with the
requirements of clauses (y) and (z) of this _Section 5.02(d) _with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the period during which the Company and
its Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with Parent
regarding any Modified Terms proposed by Parent in response to such new
Acquisition Proposal shall expire on the later to occur of two (2) Business
Days after the Company provides written notice of such new
Acquisition Proposal to Parent and the end of the original five (5) Business
Day period described above; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event there
is a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with this
_Section 5.02(d)_ with respect to

  



    

54 
--- 

 



    



  

a Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may
simultaneously give notice of its intention both to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.02(d)_ and to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(e)_ and the notice and negotiation
periods set forth in this _Section 5.02(d)_ may pass simultaneously.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the
Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
including (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the taking of any such
position or making of any such disclosure contemplated by this  _Section
5.02(e)_ shall not affect the Company's and the Board of Directors of the
Company's duties under this _Section 5.02_ and neither the Company nor the
Board of Directors of the Company (nor the Special Committee) may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change except in compliance with this _Section
5.02_.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer, whether in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, relating to (A) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tender offer or
exchange offer, in any such case, that if consummated would result in any
Person, directly or indirectly, beneficially owning 20% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, (B) a direct or indirect sale, lease,
license, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of assets of the Company
(including equity interests in Subsidiaries) or any of its Subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets
of the Company determined on a book-value basis, (C) any issuance, sale or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person of securities
representing 20% or more of the total voting power of the Company, or (D)
any combination of the foregoing (other than any such inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer made by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates). For the avoidance of doubt, any inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or offer relating solely to business of the Company that comprises
(1) the Company's commercial segment, or (2) the Company's government
segment, in each case, for SEC reporting purposes, shall constitute an
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of
_Section 5.02_ which the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its (or the Special Committee's) financial advisor and
outside legal counsel), taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory
and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement

  



    

55

provisions and conditions to consummation, as well as any Modified Terms
proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to such proposal or
otherwise, (A) to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed
(provided that for the purpose of this definition, (1) references to "20%" in
clauses (A) and (C) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%" and (2) references to "20%" in clause (B) of the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"60%").

  



  

Section 5.03. Access to Information; Confidentiality _. _From the date
hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) (a) provide Parent and their respective Representatives
reasonable access at reasonable times, and upon reasonable notice to the
Company, to the officers, employees, books and records, properties and
Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, reasonably provide any financial and operating data,
customer billing and other data files for the purpose of system integration
and testing as well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose
of payroll system integration and testing with respect to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and other information regarding the assets,
properties or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from
time to time reasonably request; provided, that (i) such access or
information requests do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' business and shall be subject to their
respective reasonable security measures and insurance requirements, (ii)
Parent and its Representatives shall not contact or otherwise communicate
with the customers or suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than contact or other communications with such customers or suppliers by
Parent in the ordinary course of business and not related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) unless, in each instance, approved in writing
in advance by the Company, (iii) such access shall not require the Company or
its Subsidiaries to allow any environmental testing or sampling and (iv)
nothing herein shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to furnish to
Parent or its Representatives, or provide Parent or its Representatives with
access to, information to the extent that legal counsel for the Company (or
the Special Committee) reasonably determines that doing so would (A) violate
Antitrust Laws, (B) result in the loss of an attorney-client or other
legal privilege or (C) violate the terms of any Contract. In the event that
the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding subclause (iv), it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the applicable third party that is required in order to
disclose the applicable information and otherwise communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable
Antitrust Law or obligation or waive such a privilege. Parent acknowledges
that the information and access provided pursuant to this _Section 5.03_
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality and Non-
Disclosure Agreement dated as of July 13, 2015 by the Company and Parent (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this _Section
5.03_ or information provided or received by any Party pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement.

Section 5.04. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) consummate the
Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authority any consent, approval,
authorization, waiver or order required to be obtained or made by any Party
or any of their respective Affiliates and avoid any Action by any Governmental
Authority, in each case in connection with the Offer and the Merger and to
fulfill the conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement required under applicable Law,
including the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and to fulfill the conditions to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) to the extent
requested by Parent, obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers
and approvals and make all necessary or appropriate notifications under any
Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with
the Offer and the Merger (provided, that the actions contemplated by this
subclause (iv) shall not be a condition to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger). Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in connection with
obtaining all such consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or orders and
the making of all such filings, including, unless prohibited by applicable
Law or a Governmental Authority, providing copies of all such non-proprietary
documents to outside counsel for the non-filing Party prior to filing and, if
reasonably requested, accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested in connection therewith. Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly furnish to each other
all information reasonably required for any application or other filing to be
made by the other with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Parent and the Company agree to make, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to make, any necessary filings under the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Laws no later than ten (10) Business Days after execution
of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, comply at the earliest practicable date with any
request under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws to provide information,
documents or other materials requested by any Governmental Authority.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall each request early termination of
the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate in
connection with their respective efforts to obtain termination or expiration
of the applicable waiting period and all requisite clearances and approvals
under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and
in any event before the End Date. In connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental
Authority, (i) keep the other Party promptly informed of any communication
received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii)
provide outside counsel for the

  



    

57 
--- 

 



    



  

other Party with a reasonable opportunity to (A) review in advance any
proposed communication by such Party or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Authority, (B) consult with the other Party prior to any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Authority, and (C) attend and participate in
such meetings or conferences. Without the prior written consent of the other
Party, Parent and the Company will not, and will not permit their respective
Affiliates to consent or agree to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 5.04_ as "outside counsel only." Such
competitively sensitive material and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

  



  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
Parties contained in this Section 5.04, Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to resolve such
objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority may assert under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and avoid
the institution of any Action under any such Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case so as to enable the Offer and the Merger to occur as
promptly as possible and in any event before the End Date, to ensure that no
Governmental Authority enters any Order or establishes any Law
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to ensure
that no Governmental Authority with the authority to authorize or approve such
consummation fails to do so as promptly as practicable and in any event
before the End Date; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no such remedy shall be (A) required
unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Merger, (B) proposed, agreed to
or effected by the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of Parent or (C) required to be agreed to by Parent or its Affiliates
if such remedy would have a material adverse effect on the business, results
of operations or financial condition of (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) or (y) Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Merger).

  



  

(f) Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the
termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
neither Parent nor the Company shall, and shall not permit any of their
respective Affiliates to, enter into any binding agreement or any letter of
intent (whether or not binding) for any acquisition (via stock purchase,
merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) of, or commence any
tender offer for, any ownership interest or assets of any Person if such
ownership interest or assets would reasonably be expected to materially delay
or materially and adversely affect Parent's ability to obtain termination or

expiration of the applicable waiting period and all requisite clearances and
approvals under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable and in any event
before the End Date.

  



  

Section 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  



  

(a) For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, all past and present directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interest of, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, including any charitable or not-for profit public service
organization or trade association whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as
it presently exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights or rights of advancement
of expenses than such Law permitted Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), but subject to Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, (ii) without limitation
to clause (i), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, include and
cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation's (or any
successor's) organizational documents for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers
of the Company, no less favorable than those contained in the Company's
organizational documents as of the date hereof and (iii) not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (B) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and (C) subject to the
receipt of the undertaking referred to in subclause (i), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel
retained by an Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor are
received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the
defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
or the Surviving

  



    

59 
--- 

 



    



  

Corporation (1) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (2) shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant
hereto.

  



  

(b) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or
assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.05_.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, non-cancellable "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from insurance
carriers with the same or better claims-paying ability ratings as the
Company's current insurance carriers with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for the persons who are covered by the
Company's existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Company's existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not pay, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall not be required to pay, for such "tail" insurance policies a one-
time premium in excess of 300% of the Company's current annual premium for
DandO Insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), which current annual premium is set
forth in Section 5.05(c) of the Disclosure Letter. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by
the Company's existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in such existing DandO
Insurance, from insurance carriers with the same or better claims-paying
ability ratings as the Company's current DandO Insurance carriers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay for
such DandO Insurance an annual premium in excess of the Premium Cap, in which
case the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Company's existing
DandO Insurance, DandO Insurance with the best overall terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.05_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract
pursuant to any Contracts set forth in Section 3.12(a)(ix) of the Disclosure
Letter or the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06. Employee Matters.

  



  

(a) For a period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2016 (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Continuing Employee), each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who remains in the active employment of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall
receive (i) an annual rate of salary or wages and annual incentive
opportunities (excluding equity or equity-based compensation or incentive
opportunities) that are, in each case, substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees in
the same or comparable geographic locations, and (ii) employee benefits
(excluding equity or equity-based compensation or incentive opportunities)
that are substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided by Parent
to its similarly situated employees in the same or comparable
geographic locations. In addition, the flexible spending accounts maintained
under the Company's cafeteria plan will continue to be maintained through a
date ending no earlier than the last day of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs, unless such accounts are merged prior thereto into
successor arrangements maintained by the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and
the Company shall take no action after the date of this Agreement that
would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any specific Benefit Plans or compensation, retention or employment
arrangements or to continue the employment of any specific person, and nothing
herein shall prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after
the Effective Time, any Benefit Plan in accordance with their terms, subject
to compliance with _Section 5.06(a)_.

  



  

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan in which any
Continuing Employee participates, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee
with the Company or its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent service with such
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries) as if
such service had been performed with Parent with respect to any plans or
programs in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time for all purposes under such plans or programs except with
regard to benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit retirement plan
of any type or eligibility to participate in or vesting under any equity or
equity-based compensation plans, except, in each case, to the extent such

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
and limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods
and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees under the welfare plans or comparable welfare
plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide
each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
to the extent applicable under the relevant welfare benefit plan in which
Continuing Employees participate from and after the Effective Time, as if
there had been a single continuous employer, to the extent credited under the
welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) Unless otherwise requested by Parent at least ten (10) days

event of such termination, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Company 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolution (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to prior review and approval by
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) of
the Board of Directors of the Company. In the event of such termination,
Parent shall cause each Continuing Employee who is a participant in a Company
401(k) Plan to be allowed to participate in a tax qualified plan which
includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and maintained by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and such Continuing
Employee shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting service for
all periods of service with the Company or any other entity to the extent so
credited with such service under the applicable Company 401(k) Plan. In
addition, Parent shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, take all actions
necessary so that the Parent 401(k) Plan will accept rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, inclusive of loans) from the Company 401(k) Plan.

conditions to receipt of the amount of the Financing necessary to pay the

control (but excluding any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a
direct result of the Company's failure to furnish information as required
under _Section 5.13_ or the Company's breach of any of its other
obligations under _Section 5.13_) and, upon satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter, to consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Closing, (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter, including

Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreement, (iii) a counterparty

Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter, (iv) Parent receives any written notice or other
written communication from any Person with respect to any actual breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Financing Agreement or (v) Parent determines in good faith that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary
to pay the aggregate Offer Price and the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , that in no event will Parent be under any
obligation to disclose any information shared among Parent and its
professional advisors in connection with matters contemplated by the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) that is subject to attorney-client or
similar legal privilege. Without limiting Parent's other obligations under
this _Section 5.14_, if the commitments with respect to all or any portion
of the Financing expire or are terminated or all or any portion of the
Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, then Parent shall (i) promptly
notify the Company of such event and the reasons therefor, (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative
financing sources in an amount sufficient to pay all amounts required to paid
in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), and (iii) obtain,
and when obtained, provide the Company with a true, correct and complete copy
of each alternative financing commitment in respect of such Alternative
Financing (each, a " _New Commitment Letter_ "), together with all related fee
letters (solely in the case of the fee letters, with only (A) the fee
amounts, yield or interest rate caps, and original issue discount amounts and
(B) "flex," and other economic terms, in each case under this clause (B) that

or conditionality of or the aggregate amount of net proceeds available under
such financing, contained therein redacted). In the event any New Commitment
Letter is obtained, (1) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter as modified pursuant to clause (2) below, (2) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment
Letter which is not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at the time in
question and each New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (3)
any reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include
any fee letter relating to the Commitment Letter that is not superseded by
any New Commitment Letter at the time in question and each New Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect.

notices (including the Redemption Notice), publications and other
communications to holders of the Convertible Notes or the Trustee, prior to
their delivery or publication, and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and Merger Sub. The Company

the lenders to make loans or other extensions of credit under the Senior
Credit Facility shall be terminated and the Surviving Corporation shall be

terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose breach or failure to perform or comply with any
obligation under this Agreement resulted in or was a proximate cause of the
issuance of any such Order;

(c) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, upon written notice to
the Company, if there has been any violation or breach by the Company of any
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, which would,

breach has not been waived by Parent, (ii) Parent has provided written notice

Section 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_, written notice thereof shall
be given by the terminating Party to the other Party identified in _Section
7.01_, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made and the basis therefor, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and of no effect without liability or obligation on the part of any
Party (or any Affiliate of such Party and such Party's and its Affiliates'
respective directors, officers, members, managers, employees, agents or
representatives), except that no such termination shall relieve any Party
from any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or willful
and material breach of this Agreement prior to or in connection with such
termination or from any obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.03_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of
_Article 1_, this _Section 7.02_,  _Section 7.03_ and _Article 8_ and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall each survive the termination of
this Agreement, as applicable, in accordance with their respective terms. If
this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, (a) Parent shall cause the
Offer to be terminated as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) after termination of this Agreement and (b) all filings,
applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the
extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or
other Person to which they were made.

  



  

Section 7.03. Fees and Expenses.

  



  

(a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee (i) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, on
or before the third (3rd) Business Day) following the date of such termination
(in the case of termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_) or (ii)
concurrently with such termination (in the case of termination by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_), by wire transfer of immediately
available U.S. dollars to the applicable account or accounts designated in
writing to the Company by Parent.

  



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ (unless the Company would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d) but for such
termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ ) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.01(c)_ , and, in any such case, (i) at any time after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not publicly
withdrawn prior to such date and (ii) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter
consummated (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal that was
publicly announced prior to the termination of this Agreement), then the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee
prior to or concurrently with the consummation of such transaction by wire
transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to the applicable account or
accounts designated in writing to the Company by Parent. For purposes of only
subclause (ii) of this _Section 7.03(c)_ , the term "Acquisition

  



    

72 
--- 

 



    



  

Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section
5.02(f)(i)_ , except that the references to "20%" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%".

  



  

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company
Termination Fee (or any portion thereof), then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment plus two percent (2%). The Company Termination
Fee is non-refundable and shall not be set off by or credited against any
other payment.

  



  

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Parent's right, if any, to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 7.03_, and the amounts described in _Section 7.03(d)_, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates against the Company and its former, current or future
stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment of such Company Termination
Fee and any applicable amount described in _Section 7.03(d)_, neither the
Company nor any of its former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that, nothing in this _Section 7.03(e)_ shall relieve the Company
from any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or willful and
material breach of this Agreement prior to or in connection with such
termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee more than once.

  



  

Section 7.04. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Acceptance
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) any such amendment shall be in a
writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto and signed on behalf
of each of the Parties, (b) after the Acceptance Time, there shall be made no
amendment that decreases the Offer Price or the Per Share Merger Consideration
and (c) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections 7.05_, _8.05_ , _8.06_ , 
_8.07_ , _8.08_ , _8.09_ , _8.13_ and this _Section 7.04_ (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of _Sections 7.05_, _8.05_ ,  _8.06_ ,
_8.07_ , _8.08_ , _8.09_ , _8.13_ and this _Section 7.04_) may not be
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse to any Financing
Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

  



  

Section 7.05. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other

  



    

73 
--- 

 



    



  

Parties, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No
waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall
any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between the Parties. No
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective except by written
instrument executed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other acts
hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of
the time for performance of any other obligations or any other acts.

applicable statute of limitations, agree that (a) all of the representations

and shall not survive the Effective Time for any purpose, and

made by, any Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, members, managers, employees, agents or
representatives, in respect thereof, (b) after the Effective Time, there
shall be no liability on the part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any

in respect of any covenants or agreements that, by their terms, contemplate
performance at or prior to the Effective Time, and (c) covenants or
agreements that, by their terms, contemplate performance following the
Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time for the period set forth
therein or until fully performed.

constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of the Company, except and solely to the extent that a
representation or warranty set forth in _Article 3_ of this Agreement
specifically states that a true, correct and complete list of a

Letter. The fact that any item or other information is disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item or other
matter in the Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is or is not material, that such
item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or that such item will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set
forth in this Agreement. Headings in the Disclosure Letter are inserted for
reference purposes and for convenience of the reader only, and shall not
affect the interpretation thereof or of this Agreement. Nothing contained in
the Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of liability or

Section 8.05. Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of
this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as expressly provided herein, the
rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent and/or Merger Sub may assign its rights (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement to any of its Financing Sources as
collateral security and Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or
all of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder to any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

Section 8.06. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or implied
in this Agreement is intended to confer any legal or equitable rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that after
the Effective Time, _Section 5.05_ shall be enforceable by each Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right to
enforce their rights under _Sections 7.04_, _7.05_ , _8.05_ , _8.07_ ,
_8.08_ , _8.09_ , _8.13_ and this _Section 8.06_.

  



  

Section 8.07. Governing Law. This Agreement and its enforcement will be
governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Maryland applicable to agreements made and to be performed within such state
without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof; provided, however,
that the adjudication of any action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether at law or equity, whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise, involving a Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing, the Debt Letters, the Definitive Financing Agreement, any
Alternative Financing or any New Commitment Letter or the performance of any
thereof or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, shall be
governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (it
being understood and agreed that after Closing and solely with respect to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, the governing law provisions of the
Definitive Financing Agreement shall supplant this proviso to the extent
applicable); provided, further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and

  



    

76 
--- 

 



    



  

agreed that any proceeding with respect to the Financing, the Debt Letters,
the Definitive Financing Agreement, any Alternative Financing or any New
Commitment Letter or any Financing Source involving (a) the interpretation of
the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" (and whether or not a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred), (b) the determination of the accuracy of any
Acquired Business Representation (as defined in the Commitment Letter) and
whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof Parent and/or Merger Sub have
the right to terminate their obligations under this Agreement or decline to
consummate the Offer or the Merger and (c) the determination of whether the
Offer or the Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, in each case shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland.

  



  

Section 8.08. Consent to Jurisdiction.

  



  

(a) Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or any federal court located in
Baltimore, Maryland, including any appellate courts therefrom (the " _Maryland
Courts_ "), for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the breach, termination or validity thereof. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceedings brought in such court. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court (i)
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Maryland Courts
for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with
applicable Law, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of the Maryland Courts or from any legal process commenced in
the Maryland Courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that
(A) the suit, action or proceeding in the Maryland Courts is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by the Maryland Courts.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting _Section
8.13_, each Party unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing, the Debt Letters, the Definitive Financing
Agreement, any Alternative Financing or any New Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof); _provided_ that, after the Closing
and solely with respect to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, it is
understood and agreed that the submission to jurisdiction provisions of the
Definitive Financing Agreement (and related documents) shall supplant this
paragraph to the extent applicable.

Section 8.09. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE, OR
WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE DEFINITIVE FINANCING
AGREEMENT, ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OR ANY NEW COMMITMENT LETTER, THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF, OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.09_.

  



  

Section 8.10. Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable
harm would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or
other undertaking, the Parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any such
action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
Party will allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim,
that there is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties further agree that (a)
by seeking any remedy provided for in this _Section 8.10_, a Party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to such Party under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in
this  _Section 8.10_ shall require any Party to institute any action for (or
limit such Party's right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this _Section 8.10_ before exercising any other right under this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.11. Severability. If any provisions of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (a) a substitute and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction, the intent and purpose of the
invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (including by means of facsimile and electronically
transmitted portable document format (pdf) signature pages), each of which
shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

  



  

Section 8.13. Waiver of Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company (prior to the Closing) (and each of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives and Affiliates) hereby
waives any rights or claims (whether at law or equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreement, the performance thereof or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and the Company (prior to the Closing) (and
each of its officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives and
Affiliates) hereby agrees not to commence any action or proceeding (whether at
law or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source
in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreement, the performance thereof or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and further agrees to dismiss or
otherwise terminate (in the case of itself) and to cause (in the case of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives and Affiliates) to be
dismissed or otherwise terminated any such action or proceeding asserted by
the Company (prior to Closing) (whether at law or equity, in contract, tort
or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Letters or the Definitive Financing
Agreement, the performance thereof or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source
shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company (prior to
the Closing) in any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt
Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreement, the performance thereof or any
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

variations shall operate upon the terms of such class or series of stock is
clearly and expressly set forth in the articles supplementary or other Charter
document.

or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of Common Stock

costs, the secretary shall give notice to each stockholder entitled to notice
of the meeting.

  



  

Section 4. _NOTICE_. Not less than ten nor more than 90 days before
each meeting of stockholders, the secretary shall give to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting and to each stockholder not entitled to vote
who is entitled to notice of the meeting notice in writing or by electronic

a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall
be sufficient to approve any other matter which may properly come before the
meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast is required by statute
or by the Charter. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by the Charter,
each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, entitles the holder
thereof to cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of
stockholders. Voting on any question or in any election may be _viva voce_
unless the chairman of the meeting shall order that voting be by ballot or
otherwise.

proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person
who has been appointed to vote such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution
of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or agreement of the
partners of a partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution
or agreement, in which case such person may vote such stock.

other provision of the Charter or these Bylaws, Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the

such group.

  



  

The directors present at a meeting which has been duly called and at which a

directors to leave fewer than required to establish a quorum.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 7. _VOTING_. The action of a majority of the directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the action of the
Board of Directors, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is
required for such action by applicable law, the Charter or these Bylaws. If
enough directors have withdrawn from a meeting to leave fewer than required to
establish a quorum, but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the
majority of that number of directors necessary to constitute a quorum at such
meeting shall be the action of the Board of Directors, unless the concurrence
of a greater proportion is required for such action by applicable law, the
Charter or these Bylaws.

  



  

Section 8. _ORGANIZATION_. At each meeting of the Board of
Directors, the chairman of the board or, in the absence of the chairman, the

the president or, in the absence of the president, a director chosen by a

Section 10. _CONSENT BY DIRECTORS WITHOUT A MEETING_. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may

minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 11. _VACANCIES_. If for any reason any or all of the
directors cease to be directors, such event shall not terminate the
Corporation or affect these Bylaws or the powers of the remaining directors
hereunder. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors for any cause other than an
increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the
remaining directors, even if such majority is less than a quorum. Any vacancy
in the number of directors created by an increase in the number of directors
may be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors. Any
individual so elected as director shall serve until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies.

directors. Directors may be reimbursed for expenses of attendance, if any, at
each annual, regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof and for their expenses, if any, in connection with each
property visit and any other service or activity they perform or engage in as
directors; but nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude

  



    



 



    



  

any directors from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor.

  



  

Section 13. _RELIANCE_. Each director and officer of the Corporation
shall, in the performance of his or her duties with respect to the
Corporation, be entitled to rely on any information, opinion, report or
statement, including any financial statement or other financial data,
prepared or presented by an officer or employee of the Corporation whom the
director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented, by a lawyer, certified public accountant or other person,
as to a matter which the director or officer reasonably believes to be within
the person's professional or expert competence, or, with respect to a
director, by a committee of the Board of Directors on which the director does
not serve, as to a matter within its designated authority, if the
director reasonably believes the committee to merit confidence.

  



  

Section 14. _RATIFICATION_. The Board of Directors or the
stockholders may ratify any action or inaction by the Corporation or its
officers to the extent that the Board of Directors or the stockholders could
have originally authorized the matter, and if so ratified, shall have the
same force and effect as if originally duly authorized, and such ratification
shall be binding upon the Corporation and its stockholders. Any action or
inaction questioned in any stockholders' derivative proceeding or any other
proceeding on the ground of lack of authority, defective or irregular
execution, adverse interest of a director, officer or stockholder, non-
disclosure, miscomputation, the application of improper principles or
practices of accounting or otherwise, may be ratified, before or after
judgment, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, and such
ratification shall constitute a bar to any claim or execution of any
judgment in respect of such questioned action or inaction.

  



  

Section 15. _CERTAIN RIGHTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_. Any director
or officer, in his or her personal capacity or in a capacity as an
affiliate, employee, or agent of any other person, or otherwise, may have

STOCK

  



  

Section 1. _CERTIFICATES_. Except as may be otherwise provided by
the Board of Directors, stockholders of the Corporation are not entitled to
certificates representing the shares of stock held by them. In the event that
the Corporation issues shares of stock represented by certificates, such
certificates shall be in such form as prescribed by the Board of Directors or
a duly authorized officer, shall contain the statements and information
required by the MGCL and shall be signed by the officers of the Corporation in
any manner permitted by the MGCL. In the event that the Corporation issues
shares of stock without certificates, to the extent then required by
the MGCL, the Corporation shall provide to the record holders of such shares
a written statement of the information required by the MGCL to be included on
stock certificates. There shall be no differences in the rights and
obligations of stockholders based on whether or not their shares are
represented by certificates.

  



  

Section 2. _TRANSFERS_. All transfers of shares of stock shall be
made on the books of the Corporation, by the holder of the shares, in person
or by his or her attorney, in such manner as the Board of Directors or any
officer of the Corporation may prescribe and, if such shares
are certificated, upon surrender of certificates duly endorsed. The issuance
of a new certificate upon the transfer of certificated shares is subject to
the determination of the Board of Directors that such shares shall no longer
be represented by certificates. Upon the transfer of any uncertificated
shares, the Corporation shall provide to the record holders of such shares, to
the extent then required by the MGCL, a written statement of the information
required by the MGCL to be included on stock certificates.

  



    



 



    



  

The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share
of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or on the
part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by the laws of the
State of Maryland.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares of any class or series of
stock will be subject in all respects to the Charter and all of the terms and
conditions contained therein.

  



  

Section 3. _REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATE_. Any officer of the
Corporation may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place
of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation
alleged to have been lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost,
destroyed, stolen or mutilated; provided, however, if such shares have ceased
to be certificated, no new certificate shall be issued unless requested in
writing by such stockholder and the Board of Directors has determined that
such certificates may be issued. Unless otherwise determined by an officer of
the Corporation, the owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated
certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be
required, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or
certificates, to give the Corporation a bond in such sums as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation.

entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or
determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the
allotment of any other rights, or in order to make a determination of
stockholders for any other proper purpose. Such date, in any case, shall not
be prior to the close of business on the day the record date is fixed and
shall be not more than 90 days and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders,
not less than ten days, before the date on which the meeting or particular
action requiring such determination of stockholders of record is to be held
or taken.

  



  

When a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice
of and to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been set as provided in this
section, such record date shall continue to apply to the meeting if adjourned
or postponed, except if the meeting is adjourned or postponed to a date more
than 120 days after the record date originally fixed for the meeting, in
which case a new record date for such meeting shall be determined as set
forth herein.

  



  

Section 5. _STOCK LEDGER_. The Corporation shall maintain at its
principal office or at the office of its counsel, accountants or transfer
agent, an original or duplicate stock ledger containing the name and address

Directors may authorize the Corporation to issue fractional shares of stock or
authorize the issuance of scrip, all on such terms and under such conditions
as it may determine. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter or
these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of units
consisting of different securities of the Corporation. Any security

  



    



 



    



  

issued in a unit shall have the same characteristics as any

as the Board of Directors may from time to time, in its absolute
discretion, think proper as a reserve fund for contingencies, for equalizing
dividends, for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation or
for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall determine, and the
Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve.

the requirements of any law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place
the word "(SEAL)" adjacent to the signature of the person authorized to
execute the document on behalf of the Corporation.

  



    



 



    



  

ARTICLE XI

  



  

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCE OF EXPENSES

  



  

To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time,
the Corporation shall indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary
determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, shall pay or
reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding
to (a) any individual who is a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation (or a predecessor of the Corporation) and who is made or
threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason of
his or her service in that capacity or (b) any individual who, while a
director or officer of the Corporation (or a predecessor of the Corporation)
and at the request of the Corporation (or a predecessor of the Corporation),
serves or has served as a director, officer, trustee, member, manager or
partner of another corporation, real estate investment trust, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or
witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity.
The rights to indemnification and advance of expenses provided by the Charter
and these Bylaws shall vest immediately upon election of a director or
officer. The Corporation may, with the approval of its Board of Directors,
provide such indemnification and advance for expenses to any employee or agent
of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation. The indemnification
and payment or reimbursement of expenses provided in these Bylaws shall not be
deemed exclusive of or limit in any way other rights to which any person
seeking indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses may be or may
become entitled under any bylaw, resolution, insurance, agreement or
otherwise.

  



  

Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption or
amendment of any other provision of the Charter or these Bylaws inconsistent
with this Article, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability
of the preceding paragraph with respect to any act or failure to act which
occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

WAIVER OF NOTICE

  



  

Whenever any notice of a meeting is required to be given pursuant to the
Charter or these Bylaws or pursuant to applicable law, a waiver thereof in
writing or by electronic transmission, given by the person or persons
entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business
to be transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in
the waiver of notice of such meeting, unless specifically required by
statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on
the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.
