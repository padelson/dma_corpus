Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto and is enforceable in accordance with its terms against each of the parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. All commitment fees and other fees
required to be paid thereunder have been paid in full or will be duly paid in full as and when due, and Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by them pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letter on or prior to the date hereof. The Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified, rescinded, withdrawn or terminated in any respect on or prior to the date hereof, and no such amendment, modification or termination is
contemplated or the subject of current discussions as of the date hereof other than as would not require a Consent or waiver of this Agreement. As of the date hereof no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute or reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default by Parent or Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other Person, thereunder or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable. The consummation of the Financing and the obligation of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letter to make the full amount of the Financing available to Parent at the Closing are subject to no conditions

Financing will not be satisfied or the Financing will not be consummated and available in full on or before the date of the Closing. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
