ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "):

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.3_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal
Shares and Excluded Shares) shall be converted into, and become exchangeable
for, the right to receive (i) $38.75 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ")
and (ii) 0.2141 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share (the " _Stock Consideration_ ", together with the
Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "). At the
Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and Appraisal Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the shares of Company Common
Stock, and each non-certificated share of Company Common Stock represented by
book entry (each, a " _Book Entry Company Share_ "), other than in each case
those representing Excluded Shares or Appraisal Shares, shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive, without interest, (A) the Merger
Consideration, and (B) with respect to the Stock Consideration, the right, if
any, to receive (1) pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ and (2) any
distribution or dividend payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

 

(b) If (v) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the Merger, plus (w) the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Assumed Restricted Stock Awards as of
immediately following the Effective Time plus (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Assumed Performance Unit Awards as
of immediately following the Effective Time, plus (y) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that would be available for issuance immediately following
the Effective Time in respect of the remaining shares reserved and available
for issuance under the Company Stock Plan assumed pursuant to _Section
2.5(d)_, plus (z) any other shares required to be taken into account for
purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (or any successor thereto) (the "
_Total Issuance_ ") would exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Stock
Threshold_ "), then (i) first, the Company shall, at Parents request at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, amend the Company Stock
Plan to reduce the number of shares remaining reserved and available for
issuance thereunder by the minimum extent necessary to cause the Total
Issuance (as so reduced) not to exceed the Stock Threshold (but in no event
below an amount equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to Company Equity Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time)) (the "
_Company Stock Plan Reduction_ "), and (ii) then, if the Company Stock Plan
Reduction is insufficient to cause the Total Issuance (as reduced by the
Company Stock Plan Reduction) not to exceed the Stock Threshold, (A) the
Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (rounded down
to the nearest ten-thousandth) such that the Total Issuance (as reduced by the
Company Stock Plan Reduction and such reduction in the Exchange Ratio) does
not exceed the Stock Threshold and (B) the Cash Consideration for all
purposes under this Agreement will be increased on a per-share basis by the
amount of such reduction in the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Stock
Price (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a cent).

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is an Excluded Share shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no consideration paid in exchange

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange

with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or to be paid

(such cash, certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock and evidence of
Book Entry Parent Shares, together with the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to this _Article II_ with respect thereto, in
the aggregate, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash available in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in obligations, funds or accounts typical for
(including having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the

prompt cash payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a),_ plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f),_ plus any dividends

level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be
promptly returned to Parent as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_. The Exchange
Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for the
purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book Entry Company
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) that are evidenced by Certificates
or Book Entry Company Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form
reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Company

of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the Certificates as

the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of
an "agents message" with respect to Book Entry Company Shares)) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or

and any dividends or 

 



4

    

 distributions, in each case, to which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. With respect to Book Entry Company Shares held
through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures
with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after
the Closing Date, upon surrender of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with
DTCs customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section
2.2(f)_ and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which the
beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) After the Effective Time, and (A) upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) that are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavit of
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in
_Section 2.2(h)_) in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal
and accompanying instructions, (B) upon the transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) that are Book Entry Company Shares
not held through DTC, in accordance with the terms of the letter
of transmittal and accompanying instructions (including the delivery of any
other documents the Exchange Agent may reasonably require), or (C) upon the
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) that
are Book Entry Company Shares held through DTC, including by delivery of an
"agents message," in accordance with DTCs customary procedures and such
other customary procedures as agreed by Parent, the Exchange Agent and DTC,
the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as
practicable, (1) the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, (2) the number of
Certificates of shares of Parent Common Stock or Book Entry Parent Shares
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has a right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, (3) any dividends or
other distributions payable that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to _Section 2.2(d)_, and (4) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.2(f)_, if applicable.

 

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Exchange
Agent may make payment of the proper amount of Merger Consideration to such
transferee if (A) in the case of Book Entry Company Shares, written
instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book Entry Company Shares are
presented to the Exchange Agent, (B) in the case of Certificates, the
Certificates formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock are
surrendered to the Exchange Agent, and (C) the written instructions, in the
case of clause (A), and Certificates, in the case of clause (B), are
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Exchange Agent. If any shares of Parent Common Stock are to be
delivered to a Person other than the holder in whose name any shares of
Company Common Stock are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the transfer of shares of Parent Common
Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock. Any Certificate that has
been surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

(d)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company Common
Stock_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and, whenever
a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in
respect of all Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Book Entry Company Share until such Certificate (or affidavits
of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) or Book Entry Company Share is transferred for
exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in _Section 2.2(h)_) or transfer of such Book Entry Company Share that has
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, there
shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or as applicable, Book Entry Parent
Shares) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender or transfer, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer,
as applicable.

(e) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Company Share is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Merger
Consideration (and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and/or
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_) to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

 

(f) _Fractional Shares of Company Common Stock_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will
be issued and any holder of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this _Section 2.2(f)_ shall
be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest whole cent, which payment shall be calculated by
the Exchange Agent and shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the
Parent Stock Price multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(g)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any shares
of Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the
Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent.
Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who
has

 



6

    

 theretofore not complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent for delivery of any Merger Consideration (and to the extent
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and/or any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_), payable and/or issuable pursuant to _Section
2.1_ and _Section 2.2_ upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_) or transfer of Book Entry
Company Shares, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the time at which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any of Parents Subsidiaries with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration, and (to the extent
applicable) any cash pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ or unpaid dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_, that would have been
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, but rather
the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving
Corporation of such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect
to such Appraisal Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Appraisal Shares, then the right of
such holder to seek appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(a)_, without interest (and to the extent applicable, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.2(f)_ and/or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4  _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, subdivision,
exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date
within

 



7

    

 said period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any of the
foregoing actions with respect to its securities to the extent otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") and is vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time into the right to receive in respect of each Net Option Share,
if any, subject to such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Net Option
Share_ " means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the
Merger Consideration Value. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "
_Merger Consideration Value_ " means the sum of (1) the Cash Consideration and
(2) the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent Stock Price. For
clarity, each Company Stock Option that is vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option that is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration Value shall terminate and be cancelled as of the
Effective Time for no consideration. The Cash Consideration payable under this
_Section 2.5(a)_ to former holders of a Company Stock Options shall be paid
through the Surviving Corporations payroll to such former holders at the
next regular payroll date following the Effective Time.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. Each award of restricted shares of
Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and converted, as of the Effective Time, into an award of
shares of restricted Parent Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or
other restrictions (an " _Assumed Restricted Stock Award_ ") with the same
terms and conditions as applied to each such Company Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including terms relating to vesting
protection and the payout of accrued and future dividend or other
distribution equivalents), and relating to the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio, with the result rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock.

 

(c) _Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. Each award of
performance-based restricted stock units with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Company PRSU Award_ ") (A) designated as a "Special
2016 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit" (each, a " _2016 SPRSU Award_
"), (B) granted with respect to the 2017-2018 performance period (each, a "
_2017 PRSU Award_ ") or (C) granted with respect to the 2018-2019 performance
period (each, a " _2018 PRSU Award_ "), in each case, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and converted, as of the Effective Time, into a time-vesting
restricted unit award (each, an " _Assumed Performance Unit Award_ ");
_provided_ that each Assumed Performance Unit Award shall cover that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) either (x) for each
2017 PRSU Award, the number of shares that may be earned under such 2017 PRSU
Award based on actual performance as of immediately

 



8

    

 prior to the Effective Time relative to the previously established
performance metrics applicable thereto as determined by the Board of Directors
of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) prior to the Effective
Time, or (y) for each 2016 SPRSU Award and each 2018 PRSU Award, the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be earned under such 2016
SPRSU Award or 2018 PRSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
assuming maximum performance levels were achieved, multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Except as provided in this  _Section
2.5(c)_, each Assumed Performance Unit Award shall continue to have, and shall
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
2016 SPRSU Award, 2017 PRSU Award or 2018 PRSU Award, as the case may
be, immediately prior to the Effective Time (including terms relating to
vesting protection and the payout of accrued and future dividend or other
distribution equivalents, and other than with respect to performance metrics
thereunder)

 

(d) _Assumption of Company Stock Plan and Award Agreements_. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of Company under the Company
Stock Plan with respect to each Assumed Restricted Stock Award and Assumed
Performance Unit Award outstanding at the Effective Time and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof, in each case, subject to the adjustments in
this  _Section 2.5_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and Assumed
Performance Unit Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to the applicable Company Stock Plan, and the agreements evidencing
the grants of such Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and Assumed Performance
Unit Awards shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions, subject
to the adjustments required by this _Section 2.5_ after giving effect to the
Merger.

(e) _Reservation of Shares_. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall take
all actions to reserve the necessary shares and file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the issuance of the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and the
Assumed Performance Unit Awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as the Assumed Restricted Stock Awards and
Assumed Performance Unit Awards remain outstanding.

(f) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Company (and/or the Compensation Committee, or other applicable committee,
of the Board of Directors of the Company) and the Board of Directors of Parent
(and/or the Compensation Committee, or other applicable committee, of the
Board of Directors of Parent) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.5_.

 

Section 2.6 _Withholdings_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration, or other amounts, payable or otherwise deliverable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts (and only such amounts) as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are deducted or
withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof a true, correct and complete copy
of such written Company Benefit Plan or a written description of the material
terms of any such unwritten Company Benefit Plan and, to the
extent applicable, (i) all material trust agreements, insurance contracts or

each employee benefit plan, scheme, program, policy, arrangement and contract
(including any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
and any bonus, deferred compensation, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted
stock, stock option or other equity-based arrangement, and any employment,
termination, retention, bonus, change in control or severance agreement,
plan, program, policy, arrangement or contract) under which any current or
former director, officer, individual independent contractor, consultant or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any present or future
right to benefits, that is maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to maintain, sponsor or contribute, or with

 liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) each Company Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and its related
trust has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from Tax under the
provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the Company,

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i)
no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability (exclusive of the liability to pay insurance
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Title IV of
ERISA), in each instance, (ii) no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice

Plan or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions

material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a
change in funding method, of such Pension Plan after the valuation date used
for the most recent actuarial valuation report delivered or made available to
Parent prior to the date hereof, if any. As used in this Agreement, " _ERISA
Affiliate_ " means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) under
common control with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning
of Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or which together with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is treated as a single employer under Section 414(t) of the
Code.

 

(d) There are no pending, or the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
Proceedings with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans by any employee
or otherwise involving any such plan or the assets of any such plan (other
than routine claims for benefits) that, if determined or resolved adversely to
the Company, would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code or is a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section

31

    

 reports may have been amended after the date of their filing, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "), except as would not reasonably be expected to be,

taken as a whole. No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any report,
schedule, form, statement, prospectus, registration statement or other
document with the SEC.

subsequent to the date hereof will when so filed comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Nasdaq, the Securities Act, the

prior to the date hereof did not, and each Parent SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not when so filed, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to

aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each of
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of its executive officers and
directors is and after December 31, 2015, subject to any applicable grace

Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be included in
Parents periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act, is made
known to Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in Parents periodic and current reports required under the
Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(f) Parent has established and maintains internal controls. Parents internal
controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Parents and its Subsidiaries financial reporting and the
preparation of Parent financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date hereof, to Parents auditors and the audit

reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in internal controls. Parent has made available to the Company prior to

of the type described in the preceding sentence made by management to
Parents auditors and audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent
following December 31, 2015.

Section 4.13 _Material Contracts_.

 

(a) _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, a true, correct and complete list of each Contract to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which binds their
respective properties or assets, and which falls within any of the following
categories:

 

(i) a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act); or

(ii) a transaction, agreement or Contract that would be required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

(b) Each Contract of the type described in _Section 4.13(a)_ , whether or not
set forth in _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and whether or
not entered into on or prior to the date of this Agreement, is referred to
herein as a "Parent Material Contract". A true, complete and correct copy of
each Parent Material Contract in effect as of the date hereof has been made
available to the Company prior to the date hereof. Each Parent Material
Contract, and each other material Contract with a Top Parent Counterparty, is
valid, binding and in full force and effect with respect to Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries to the extent a party thereto and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, each other party thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. To the Knowledge of Parent, no Person is seeking to terminate or
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Parent Material Contract, or
each other material Contract with a Top Parent Counterparty, except such
terminations or challenges which have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of
Parent, any of the other parties thereto has violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act which (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would constitute a default under any provision of, and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that it
has violated or defaulted under, any Parent Material Contract or each other
material Contract with a Top Parent Counterparty, except for those violations
and defaults (or potential defaults) which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.14 _Insurance_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as of the date of this Agreement, (a) all of the insurance policies
relating to the business, employees, officers, directors, assets or operations
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and all
premiums thereon have been timely paid, (b) there is no claim pending under
Parents or any of its Subsidiaries insurance policies as to which coverage
has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies,
(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such
policies and (d) Parent has no Knowledge of any threatened termination of, or
premium increase with respect to, any of such policies. Parent and its
Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such
amounts and covering such risks as Parent reasonably believes, based on past
experience, is adequate for the businesses and operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of such
insurance).

Section 4.15 _Top Parent Counterparties_. Following December 31, 2017 and
prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the Top Parent Counterparties has
cancelled or otherwise terminated or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened,
or notified Parent in writing that it intends, to cancel or terminate or
otherwise materially and adversely modify, its relationship with Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (excluding ordinary course renewals or renegotiations of

Company of its obligations pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)_ and the accuracy of
the representations set forth in _Section 3.24_ (No Ownership of Parent

other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise) is required by Law, the
Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws or the applicable rules of Nasdaq in order for

including the Merger.

 



34

    

Section 4.17 _Brokers and Finders  Fees_. Except for Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid
exclusively by Parent or Merger Sub, no broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.18 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of the
fully executed Commitment Letter from the Financing Sources named therein,
pursuant to which such Financing Sources have committed, upon the terms and
subject only to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt
financing described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and sets forth the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms against each of the parties thereto, subject, in
each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. All commitment fees and
other fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid in full or will be
duly paid in full as and when due, and Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise
satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by
them pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or prior to the date
hereof. The Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified, rescinded,
withdrawn or terminated in any respect on or prior to the date hereof, and no
such amendment, modification or termination is contemplated or the subject of
current discussions as of the date hereof other than as would not require a
Consent or waiver of this Agreement. As of the date hereof no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute or reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other Person, thereunder or otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. The consummation of the
Financing and the obligation of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment
Letter to make the full amount of the Financing available to Parent at the
Closing are subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set
forth in the copy of the Commitment Letter delivered to the Company. Except
for the Commitment Letter, as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or
other agreements, Contracts, understandings or arrangements related to the
funding of the Financing (except for customary fee or fee credit letters
relating to the Financing, a true, complete and fully executed copy of each of
which has been provided to the Company, with only the fee amounts, "market
flex", pricing terms, pricing caps and other commercially sensitive terms
redacted). As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing will not be satisfied or the Financing will not be consummated
and available in full on or before the date of the Closing. The aggregate
proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and to
make all payments contemplated by this Agreement, including payment of the
Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness required as
a result of the consummation of the Merger, and all fees and expenses in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) A breach of this  _Section 4.18_ shall not result in a failure of a
condition pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ if Parent is capable of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date,
notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 4.18_.

 



35

Agreement, (a) beneficially owns or owned, directly or indirectly, any shares
of Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for

any Subsidiary of the Company, (b) has or had any rights to acquire any
shares of Company Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement, and (c) is
or was an "interested stockholder" of the Company (as such term is defined

or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other
equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.20 _Solvency_. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ (for such purposes,
without giving effect to any "Knowledge," "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifications or exceptions therein), (iii) the estimates,
projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Representatives, prior to the date hereof have been prepared in
good faith on assumptions that were, and continue to be, reasonable, at and
immediately after Closing, and (iv) immediately prior to the Effective Time
the Company is Solvent, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Financing, any Alternative Financing, the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Commitment Letter and the payment

an actual or matured liability), (b) has assets with present fair salable
value not less than the amount that will be required to pay their liability on
their debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) will be able to pay its
debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as they become

this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the prospectus
relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
(the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and Parent shall prepare (with the
Companys reasonable cooperation) and file

 



41

    

 with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger. Parent (with the Companys reasonable cooperation)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the initial Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof. It is the intention of the parties that the initial Form S-4 will be
filed with the SEC within 20 Business Days following the date hereof. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing with the SEC and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Form S-4 effective thereafter for so long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective by the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall instruct their
respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the other party
hereto and its respective Representatives in the preparation of the Form S-4
and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party hereto
with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other party
hereto may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4
(other than Restricted Information; _provided_ that the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to allow such information to be provided in a
manner that would not violate any such Law, Contract or obligation or
jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client or other privilege, or expose
any such party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information).

(b) Unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Change
of Board Recommendation in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.3_, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Board Recommendation.

 

(c) No amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the
prior review and approval of Parent and the Company (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent any
disclosure contained therein relates to a Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, as applicable, to comply in all material respects as to
form and substance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 shall not, at the time the
Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading or (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, at the time the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Companys stockholders or on the
date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ that
neither party makes any such covenant with respect to information supplied by
the other party. The information supplied or to be supplied by either
party hereto for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders
or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
_provided_ that neither party makes any such covenant with respect to
information supplied by the other party. In addition, the information supplied
or to be supplied by or on

 



42

    

 behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule
165 and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange

or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ that,
neither party makes any such covenant with respect to information supplied by

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) the Company and Parent shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Form S-4, Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such document
would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. The Company and Parent shall each notify the other as promptly as
practicable after the receipt by such party of any written or oral comments of
the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to, the Form S-4, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly
supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any of the foregoing
filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 or responding to any comments of the SEC or
its staff with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide
the other and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with
any such document or response. None of the Company, Parent or
their respective Representatives shall participate in any material or
substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or
any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other party to participate.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of
the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, and the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of shares of Parent
Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order
or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent shall make any other necessary filings
with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that such filings after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Closing
Date, then on the date of such filing) will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit (or will have omitted) to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ that neither party makes any such covenant with respect
to information supplied by the other party. In addition, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under any applicable
federal or state securities or "blue sky" Laws in connection with the issuance
of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger. 

Section 6.2 _Company Stockholders Meeting; Company Board Recommendation_.
Subject to applicable Law, the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws, the Company shall establish a record date
(with prior consultation with Parent) for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
the Form S-4 is declared effective by the

 



43

    

 SEC and the SEC Staff advises that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (and in no event later than 45 days after the
commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of the Company) for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
if (1) there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to
conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (2) the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may
extend the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to
the extent) the Company determines in good faith that such delay is reasonably
necessary in order to conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting or
obtain proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, as applicable; _provided_
that in no event shall the Company postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to clause (a) of this _Section 6.2_ for more
than 10 Business Days later than the most recently adjourned meeting or to a
date more than 30 Business Days after the original date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (b) the Company may delay the Company Stockholders
Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company determines in good
faith that such delay is required by applicable Law (including the
applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq), including to comply with
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4, (c) the Company may delay the Company Stockholders Meeting to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required
under applicable Law (including the applicable rules and regulations of
Nasdaq) is timely provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of the Company (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and/or (d) the Company may delay the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) that Parent
provides its prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Unless the Company has effected a Change of Board
Recommendation as provided in _Section 6.3_, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Company Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding its solicitation efforts and proxy tallies
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including by allowing
Parent and its Representatives to participate in meetings and discussions
with the Company and its proxy solicitor and by directing such proxy solicitor
to provide regular reports to Parent. Notwithstanding any Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 6.3_, unless this Agreement is otherwise
terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company will not change such record date or establish a different record
date without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without the prior written
consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, the adoption of this Agreement will be the only matter (other than
related procedural matters) that the Company will propose to be acted on by
the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise permitted by the other clauses of this _Section 6.3_,
from and after the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall instruct its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) whether publicly or
otherwise, initiate or solicit the submission of any offer, inquiry, proposal
or indication of interest that constitutes, or would reasonably

 



44

    

 be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any third
party any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or afford to any third party access to the business, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, in any such case with the intent to
encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any offer,
inquiry, proposal or indication of interest that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into,
conduct, participate, maintain or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with any third party with respect to any offer, inquiry, proposal or
indication of interest that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than solely to (x) inform any third
party of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.3_ or
(y) seek clarification regarding the terms or conditions of any offer,
inquiry, proposal or indication of interest), (iv) approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (v) withdraw (or qualify,
amend or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub) the Company
Board Recommendation, (vi) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (vii) if a tender offer or exchange offer
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to publicly
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Companys stockholders (including, for these purposes, by disclosing that it
is taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the Companys stockholders, which shall constitute a failure
to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) by
the close of business on the 10th business day after the commencement thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act (it being understood and agreed
that the Companys Board of Directors may take no position with respect
to such tender offer or exchange offer during the period referred to in this
clause), (viii) other than with respect to any tender offer or exchange offer,
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business
Days following Parents reasonable written request for the same, (ix) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle
or other similar document, or any Contract providing for any Acquisition
Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate, the Merger, or (x) resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (iv), (v), (vi),
(vii), (viii) or (x) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iv),
(v), (vi), (vii), or (viii)), a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ "). The
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than
Parent) conducted prior to or as of the date hereof by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and will instruct its Representatives to cease and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations,
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, and
shall, as promptly as practicable, terminate access by each such Person and
its Representatives to any online or other data rooms containing any non-
public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
the purpose of permitting such Persons to evaluate a potential Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, request of each Person that has, during the 12 months prior to the
date hereof, executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement
to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a), but
subject to _Section 6.3(c)_, if at any time following the date hereof and
prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained (i) the
Company receives a _bona fide_ written offer, inquiry, proposal or indication
of interest with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in
violation of _Section 6.3(a)_ and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such offer, inquiry, proposal or
indication of interest constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, then the Company may in response to such offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company, and afford access to the
business, books,

 



45

    

 records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, to the third party making such
offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, its Representatives and
potential sources of financing and (B) enter into, conduct, participate,
maintain or engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party making
such offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, its Representatives
and potential sources of financing regarding such offer, inquiry, proposal or
indication of interest, in each case, only if (1) the Company gives Parent a
written notice that states that the Company has received such offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest and includes all the information required
by _Section 6.3(c)_ in accordance with _Section 6.3(c)_ and thereafter
continues to comply with _Section 6.3(c)_ and  _Section 6.3(d)_, (2) prior
to furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the Company shall
have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and
prior to or substantially contemporaneously with or within 24 hours following
the provision of any non-public information concerning the Company or the
Subsidiaries of the Company to any such Person, the Company provides such
information to Parent (if such information has not previously been furnished
to Parent or its Representatives) and (3) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) Promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the receipt by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives of (i) an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for information or to engage in
negotiations or discussions that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent notice of (A) the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (B) the identity of
the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (C) a copy of all material
written proposed agreements provided by such third party in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status of, and the material
terms and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request
(including any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all material materials
sent to or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by or on behalf
of such third party making such Acquisition Proposal that describe any
material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written
summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters), in
each case to the extent not previously provided.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(a)_,
at any time prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance
with the rest of this _Section 6.3(d)_, in response to either an Intervening
Event or a Superior Proposal, effect a Change of Board Recommendation or,
solely in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal. The Company shall
not be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or Intervening
Event pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ unless (A) the Company shall have
provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to take such action, which
notice shall state expressly (1) that the Company has received a Superior
Proposal or an Intervening Event has occurred, (2) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal, or, in the case of
an Intervening Event, the material facts and circumstances (based on
information then reasonably available) related to such Intervening Event, and
(3) that it intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take

 



46

    

 such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. During the Notice Period, if requested by Parent,
the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representative regarding any amendment to this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall consider in good
faith any adjustments and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement (including
a change to the price terms hereof) that, if accepted by the Company, would be
binding upon Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ "), by no later than 11:59
p.m. (Central Time), on the last day of the Notice Period. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 6.3(d)_ to the contrary, the Board of Directors of
the Company may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal until the expiration
of the Notice Period and unless and until the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after considering the Proposed Changed
Terms (if any are proposed by Parent) and consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would still be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the
event of any material revisions or modifications to the material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to promptly (but in any
event within 24 hours) deliver a new written notice to Parent and again comply
with the requirements of this  _Section 6.3(d)_ with respect to such new
written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be two Business Days with
respect to any such revised Superior Proposal, but no such new written notice
shall shorten the original Notice Period. 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of
a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a "stop, look and listen" (or similar) statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, which actions shall not constitute or be
deemed to constitute a Change of Board Recommendation; _provided_ that, (A) in
the case of the foregoing clause (i), if such disclosure does not reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation, this _Section 6.3(e)_ shall not prevent
disclosure from being treated as a Change of Board Recommendation in
accordance with the terms of _Section 6.3(a)_ and (B) the issuance by the
Company or the Board of Directors of the Company of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change
of Board Recommendation and Parent not shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_.

Section 6.4 _Access to Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives of Parent reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books and records (including Tax records and
information necessary to confirm disclosures in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and Form S-4) and personnel, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
furnish, or cause to be furnished, promptly to Parent consistent with its
legal obligations and obligations pursuant to Contracts all other information
concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
(a) such access or provision of information shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third
party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client or any
other privilege, or expose such party to risk of liability for disclosure of
sensitive or personal information (any such information, the " _Restricted
Information_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that would
not violate any such Law, Contract or obligation or jeopardize the protection
of the attorney-client or other privilege, or expose any such

 



47

    

 party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information, and (c) the Company will be permitted to redact any information
or documentation provided to the extent that such information or
documentation includes competitively or commercially sensitive information;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to
those Persons who have entered into or are bound by a confidentiality
agreement with it or Parent and to the extent required by applicable Law or
Contract to which the Company or its respective Subsidiaries is a party. In
conducting any inspection of any properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Parent and its Representatives shall not (i) unreasonably
interfere with the business conducted at such property or (ii) damage any
property or any portion thereof. All information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue to be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement
which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall require the Company to permit the
inspection of, or to disclose, any Acquisition Proposals or any information
regarding or related to the deliberations of the Board of Directors of the
Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
entry into the Agreement, any of the matters referred to in _Section 6.3_ or
any materials provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection
therewith, in each case, except to the extent such information is required to
be disclosed in the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

Section 6.5 _Consents, Approvals and Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, and to do, or cause to be done, as promptly as practicable, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger as promptly as
practicable, including to use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable, (i) prepare and file all Filings required to be made under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, (ii) obtain all Consents, Orders, actions
or nonactions, required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law, and
(iii) obtain all necessary Consents and make all Filings from non-Governmental
Entity third parties; _provided_ that, in each case, in no event shall the
Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to pay or to commit to pay to any
Person whose Consent or waiver is being sought any cash or other
consideration, or make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability
or other obligation to such Person in connection with such consent or waiver.
The parties understand and agree that Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to do, or cause
to be done, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger as promptly as practicable pursuant to this _Section 6.5(a)_ includes
the obligation for Parent and Merger Sub to expeditiously comply with any
requests or inquiries for additional information or documentation (including
any second request) by any Governmental Entity and to enter into or agree to
divestitures, hold separate arrangements, the termination, assignment,
novation or modification of Contracts or other business relationships, the
acceptance of restrictions on business operations, the entry into other
commitments and limitations, and litigation, including with Governmental
Entities, to obtain the approvals, Consents, Orders, registrations, Permits,
authorizations and other confirmations described in clause (i) and (ii) of
this _Section 6.5(a)_ required to be obtained from any Governmental Entity
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby so long as such
actions would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In furtherance and not in limitation thereof,
not later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall each make an appropriate filing of a notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the
Company shall promptly notify the other party of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity received by such party alleging
that such Governmental Entitys consent is or may be required in connection
with or as a condition of the Merger.

 



48

    

(b) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
and coordinate with the other party in the taking of the actions contemplated
by _Section 6.5(a)_, (ii) provide such assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing, including supplying the
other party with any information that the other party may reasonably request
in order to effectuate the taking of such actions, and (iii) keep the other
party reasonably and timely informed of any developments, meetings, or
discussions with any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information, from any Governmental Entity
under any Antitrust Laws. If the Company or Parent receives a formal or
informal request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, then it shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. In addition, to the extent practicable, none of
the parties shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
conference (telephone, in-person or otherwise) with any Governmental Entity,
or any member of the staff of any Governmental Entity, in respect of any
Filing, Proceeding, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation, or other inquiry under any Antitrust Laws unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, where permitted by such
Governmental Entity, allows the other party to participate. To the extent
reasonably practicable, legal counsel for Parent and for the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and will consult with the other party on
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and
the Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Information
disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.5 _shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and  _Section 6.5(d)_ hereof. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall be required to comply with any of the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 6.5(b)_ to the extent that such compliance would be
prohibited by applicable Law. The parties shall not voluntarily extend any
waiting period associated with any Consent of any Governmental Entity or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire,
purchase, lease or license), whether by merging with or into or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in,
or by any other manner, any Person or any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division or part
thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, or take any other action,
if doing so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
Consent, action or nonaction, waiver, clearance or exemption of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking entry of an Order preventing, restraining,
impeding, delaying, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, (i) if
any information or documentation provided by the delivering party to the
other party pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ contains competitively or
commercially sensitive material, if requested by the delivering party, such
information or documentation will only be provided to outside antitrust
counsel of the receiving party (and/or to such

 



49

    

 other individuals of the receiving party or the Representatives thereof to
whom the delivering party expressly provides permission (the " _Permitted
Individuals_ ")) and shall not be disclosed by such outside antitrust counsel
or other Permitted Individuals to any individuals other than Permitted
Individuals (including employees, officers or directors of the receiving
party) unless express permission is obtained in advance from the delivering
party and (ii) any information or documentation provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ may be redacted to the extent necessary (A) to comply with any
contractual arrangement, (B) to remove references concerning valuation, or
(C) to address privilege or confidentiality concerns.

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Until the 12 month anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to
be provided, for those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue as employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
during all or a portion of the Benefits Continuation Period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), compensation (including base salary, bonus,
commission-based and other incentive compensation opportunities) and employee
benefits that, in the aggregate, with respect to each Continuing Employee,
are not less favorable than the compensation and employee benefits provided by
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the base salary
of each Continuing Employee shall not be reduced during the Benefits
Continuation Period). Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or other than as provided in any applicable employment
agreement or other Contract, to restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any such employee.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any
applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates in
which a Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective
Time to the extent such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to,
or had been satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated, (ii) provide, or cause to be provided, each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, and (iii) recognize, or
cause to be recognized, service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, determination of level of benefits and benefits accrual to the same
extent such service was recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service; and, _provided_  
_further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to provide
credit for years of service for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit pension plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries prior to the date on which the Continuing Employee actually
becomes a participant in such plan (it being understood that the Surviving
Corporation shall in all cases provide credit for years of service for benefit
accrual purposes in accordance with the terms and conditions of each such
defined benefit pension plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each employment,
change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or
agreement of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director or employee, as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement or adopted thereafter

 



50

    

 in compliance with _Section 5.2_, including those described in _Section
6.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and previously provided to Parent,
(ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any equity-
based or bonus plans, programs or agreements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time
pursuant to outstanding retention plans, programs or agreements, and all
vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit, employment
compensation or similar plans, programs, agreements or arrangements of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will constitute a change in control of the Company under the terms
of the Companys employee plans, programs, arrangements and contracts
containing provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a
change in control or similar transaction.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days
thereafter, not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, or operating unit of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries not to take any such action after such 90-day period
without complying with all provisions of WARN.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Continuing
Employees whose employment terminates during the Benefits Continuation Period
with severance benefits not materially less favorable than the severance
benefits that would have been provided in accordance with the Companys past
practices or any severance plans, policies or commitments applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall
be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan,
(ii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person, or (iii)
subject to the requirements of this _Section 6.6_, shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan following the Closing
Date.

Section 6.7  _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense. 

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, jointly and severally,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law (including to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of applicable Law
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to
which indemnification may be provided), indemnify, defend and hold harmless
(and promptly advance expenses from time to time as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted by Law; _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides a reasonable and customary undertaking (which shall not include
posting of any collateral) to repay such advances, if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification) each Person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any Person acting as director, officer, trustee,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another Person (including any Company Benefit
Plan) who is or has acted as such at the request of the Company or any such
Subsidiary (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,

 



51

    

 penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened claim (including a claim of violation
of applicable Law), action, audit, demand, suit, other Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or
investigative or other Proceeding at law or in equity or order or ruling, by
reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or is or was a director, officer, trustee,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another Person at the request of the Company,
including the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with any Indemnified Party in the defense of any
matter covered by this _Section 6.8_. Without limitation of the foregoing or
any other provision of this _Section 6.8_, Parent and the Company agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and the rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party, whether provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall survive the Merger,
be honored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and
continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary thereof to
(including by providing sufficient funds to the Surviving Corporation or the
applicable Subsidiary), at no expense to the beneficiaries, either (i)
continue to maintain in full force and effect for six years from
the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Current
Insurance_ ") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
for the Current Insurance policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are not less favorable with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby); or (ii) purchase a six year
extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current Insurance
(a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such Reporting Tail
Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the extent
purchased after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such
insurance carriers as may be specified by Parent and as are reasonably
acceptable to the Company; _provided_ that such insurance carrier has
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding the
first sentence of this _Section 6.8(b)_, but subject to the second sentence
of this _Section 6.8(b)_, the Company shall be permitted at its sole and
exclusive option to purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount;
_provided_ that in the event of the Current Insurance, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such maximum annual amount in aggregate
annual premiums.

 

(c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries shall include provisions for indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified
Parties that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the
provisions for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses
and exculpation of the

 



52

    

 Indemnified Parties as set forth in the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect and honor the
provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for
indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation
of Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts or
circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions
shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or except to make
changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the
Indemnified Parties indemnification and advancement rights thereunder.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
sentence so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.8_.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation, indemnification
provisions of the agreements listed in _Section 6.8(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of the
Indemnified Parties, or any such provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporation bylaws.

 

(f) This _Section 6.8_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.8_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification. It is expressly
agreed that each Indemnified Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of
this  _Section 6.8_, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this
_Section 6.8_. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.8_ that is denied by Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or
advancement, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such
Indemnified Partys costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this
_Section 6.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or under
any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to,
honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.8_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



53

    

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press
release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Following such
initial press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any additional press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling or participating in any press conference, conference
call, media interview or meeting with investors or analysts with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press
release, make any such other public statement or schedule or participate in
any such event before such consultation (and, to the extent applicable, shall
provide copies of any such press release, statement or agreement (or any
scripts for any statements to be made orally) to the other party and
shall consider in good faith the comments of the other party); _provided_
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.9_ shall not apply to (i)
any release or public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company
in compliance with _Section 6.3_ (including any release or public statement
made or proposed to be made by the Company with respect to a Change of Board
Recommendation), or in connection with any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any customary announcements and other customary communications,
including preparation and distribution of marketing materials, in connection
with the Financing or (iii) any public statements by either party with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
their effect on either partys business and its financial projections, with
investors, analysts and Financing Sources, including on its periodic earnings
calls and in any "road show", so long as such partys comments are consistent
with the information contained in the press releases or other documents or
communications previously issued and agreed upon by the parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, without prior consultation, each party
may disseminate information included in a press release or other documents or
communications already approved for external distribution by the other
parties.

Section 6.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly notify the
other parties in writing of any stockholder litigation or other litigation or
other Proceedings arising from this Agreement or the Merger that is brought
against such party or any of its Affiliates or members of its board of
directors (" _Transaction Litigation_ "). Each party shall keep the other
parties sufficiently informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to
the status of any Transaction Litigation (including by promptly furnishing to
the other parties hereto such information relating to the Transaction
Litigation as may be reasonably requested). The Company shall control the
defense and, subject to the following sentence, settlement of any Transaction
Litigation brought against it or any of its Affiliates or members of its or
their boards of directors, and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense (at Parents sole cost and subject to a joint
defense agreement) of such Transaction Litigation. No settlement of any
Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.11 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Takeover Statute (or any comparable
anti-takeover provisions of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws) is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. If any Takeover Statute (or any comparable anti-takeover
provisions of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws) becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law (or provision) on this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



54

    

Section 6.12 _Nasdaq Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall file a notification of listing of additional shares (or such
other form as may be required) with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and such other shares of Parent
Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger and such other shares of Parent Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing
on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) Parent and the Company agree to cooperate in taking, or causing to be
taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq
and terminate its registration under the Exchange Act, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; _provided_ that such
delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the Effective
Time. 

Section 6.13 _Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.14 _280G Calculation_. As soon as practicable, but in no event
later than 45 Business Days after the date hereof, the Company will make
available to Parent true and correct copies of its preliminary Section 280G
calculations (based on the assumptions set forth in the
applicable calculations) with respect to each "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who is reasonably likely to
receive payments or benefits in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code.

Section 6.15 _Director and Officer Resignations_. Prior to the Closing Date,
unless Parent instructs the Company otherwise, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the resignation of each individual serving
as a director or officer of (or comparable position with) the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Effective Time from his or her
position as a director or officer of (or comparable position with) the Company
and its Subsidiaries (and not as an employee, if applicable, of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), which resignations shall be effective immediately
following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, such resignation
shall not (i) prejudice in any manner any contractual rights such officer or
director may have with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause
such officer or director to cease to become entitled to any benefit under any
Company Benefit Plan to which he/she would otherwise be entitled in his or her
position as an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable or
(iii) terminate or modify the terms of any officers employment relationship
with the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.16 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of their Affiliates to, take (or cause to be taken) all
actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary to obtain and
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including: (i) to maintain in effect the Commitment Letter,
(ii) to negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
(including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee
letter) or on other terms and conditions agreed by Parent, the Company and
the Financing Sources by the Closing Date, (iii) to satisfy or cause to be
satisfied (or, if determined advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing within Parents
control and (iv) to comply with all of its obligations pursuant to the
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements related thereto, in the case
of this clause (iv), to the extent the failure to comply with such
obligations would reasonably be

 



55

    

 expected to (x) adversely affect or materially delay the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate timely the Merger and the other the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) make the timely funding of the
Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing
less likely to occur. In the event that all conditions to funding the
commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by enforcing their
rights (including through litigation) under the Commitment Letter) and to pay
related fees and expenses on the Closing Date.

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any material breach or
default by any party to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
related thereto of which Parent has become aware, or of any termination of the
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements and (ii) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication, in each case received from any
Financing Source with respect to any (1) material breach of Parents or Merger
Subs obligations under the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
related thereto, or default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related thereto or (2) material
dispute between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements related thereto or any provisions of the Commitment
Letter, in each case, to the extent any of the foregoing described in clauses
(i) or (ii) would reasonably be expected to (x) adversely affect or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate timely the
Merger and the other the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y)
make the timely funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within 5 Business Days following the
date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide any information (other than Restricted
Information) reasonably requested by the Company relating to a circumstance
referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. In
the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable and such
portion is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (unless concurrently replaced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
commitments on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and Merger
Sub than those set forth in the Commitment Letter (including after giving
effect to the market flex provisions) from other financing sources or from
proceeds of other sources of financing or cash), Parent and Merger Sub
shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative Financing for
any such portion from alternative debt sources (" _Alternative Financing_ ")
in an amount that will enable Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that does not contain
additional or modified conditions relative to those set forth in the
Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this
Agreement that, in each case, would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. Parent shall (x) to
the extent reasonably practicable, notify the Company of its intention to
obtain such Alternative Financing and keep the Company reasonably informed of
the terms thereof, (y) provide to the Company final drafts of all commitment
letters relating to the Alternative Financing prior to their execution by
Parent and/or Merger Sub so as to permit the Company a reasonable period of
time in which to confirm that such commitment letters comply with this
_Section 6.16_ and (z) deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements (including redacted copies of engagement and fee letters, removing
only fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and certain other terms (none of
which concern or would adversely affect the amounts, availability, timing or
conditionality of the Financing)) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with Alternative Financing. Parent shall provide the Company with
prompt written notice of the receipt of any notice or other communication from
any Financing Source with respect to such Financing Sources failure or
anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Commitment Letter or
definitive agreement in connection therewith. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing.

 



56

    

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.16_, Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, without the Companys prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any amendment or
modification to (including any reduction in the amount of the commitment
thereunder), or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related thereto unless the terms of the
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related thereto, in each case as so
amended, modified or waived, are substantially similar to those in the
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreement related thereto, prior to
giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver (other than economic
terms, which shall be as good as or better for Parent and Merger Sub than
those in the Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto prior
to giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver); _provided_ that
the foregoing limitations shall only apply if such amendment or modification
(i) would reasonably be expected to (A) adversely affect or materially delay
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate timely the Merger and the
other the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) make the timely
funding of the Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing less likely to occur, (ii) subject to _Section 6.16(d)_,
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or (iii) adversely affects the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against other parties
to the Commitment Letter, it being understood and agreed that in any event,
Parent may amend the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
relating thereto to (x) add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers
or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement and consent to the assignment after the date of this
Agreement of lending commitments under the Commitment Letter to other
lenders, or (y) increase the aggregate amount of the Financing, subject in
each case to _Section 6.16(a)_.

 

(d) Parent shall have the right to reduce the commitments under the Commitment
Letter (i) by the amount of the proceeds of consummated offerings or other
incurrences of debt (including notes) after the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that (A) such debt does not mature prior to the Closing Date and
(B) to the extent such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption
right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing
Date, the termination of this Agreement and the Outside Date and (ii) in
accordance with the mandatory prepayment and commitment reduction provisions
set forth in the Commitment Letter; _provided_ that any substitute
commitments shall not be on terms that (x) would reasonably be expected
to (1) adversely affect or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate timely the Merger and the other the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (2) make the timely funding of the Financing
or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely
to occur. The representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement with respect to the
Financing and the Commitment Letter apply equally to such substitute
commitments.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent
or Merger Sub obtaining any financing (including the Financing) or on the
performance of any party to the Commitment Letter.

(f) In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates prohibit or seek to
prohibit any commercial bank, investment bank or other potential provider of
financing, including the Financing Sources, from providing financing or
financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



57

    

Section 6.17 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to and, if applicable, concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their (and its and
their Representatives) reasonable best efforts to provide such cooperation as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing; _provided_ that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, prior
to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
its and their reasonable best efforts to: (i) as promptly as practicable
provide information (financial or otherwise) relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Parent and to the Financing Sources (including information to
be used in the preparation of an information package regarding the business,
operations, financial condition, financial projections and prospects of Parent
and the Company that is customary or reasonably necessary for the completion
of such financing) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with Parents preparation of customary offering or information documents to be
used for the completion of the Financing, (ii) cooperate and assist with the
due diligence, rating agency processes and marketing efforts of Parent, its

relationships of the Company, (iii) reasonably assist Parent in preparing
customary offering memoranda, rating agency presentations,
lender presentations, confidential information and private placement

(A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited statements of
income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company for each of the
three (3) fiscal years most recently ended at least 90 days prior to the
Closing Date (and audit reports for such financial statements shall not be
subject to any "going concern" qualifications), (B) unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related unaudited statements of income, comprehensive
income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company for each
subsequent fiscal quarter ended more than 45 days prior to the Closing Date

Company reasonably necessary to permit Parent to prepare pro forma

Alternative Financing, (iv) make available, on a customary and reasonable
basis and upon reasonable notice, appropriate personnel, including senior
management and Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries, documents

requested by the SEC, in connection with the completion of the Financing or
the Alternative Financing, (v) provide to Parent and the Financing Sources
promptly, and in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, all documentation and other information about the Company and
its Affiliates required by the Financing Sources or regulatory authorities
with respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, that is
required under the Commitment Letter to the extent such documentation and
other information is requested in writing to the Company at least 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, (vi) obtain any necessary consents from
the Companys independent public accounting firm in connection with any

deliver notices of prepayment and/or notices for termination of commitments
within the time periods required in connection with the prepayment of any
indebtedness or other obligations of the Company, including the Credit
Agreement, and obtain customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge to
be delivered at Closing to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in
full on the Closing Date of such indebtedness or other obligations, including
the Credit Agreement, (x) reasonably assist with the pledging of collateral
and the preparation of the definitive documentation for the Financing or the
Alternative Financing, including by providing

 



58

    

 information reasonably necessary for the completion of any schedules
thereto, in each case to the extent, and solely to the extent, such materials
relate to information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, (xi)
provide or cause to be provided any customary certificates, or other customary
closing documents as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
Financing and the Alternative Financing and (xii) consent to the use of the
trademarks, service marks and logos of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such trademarks, service
marks and logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
is reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and in conformance with the Companys quality control guidelines
and procedures as provided to Parent by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement (it being understood that all goodwill associated with such use
shall inure to the sole benefit of the Company). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur prior to the
Closing any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing,
unless Parent reimburses or is required to reimburse or indemnify the Company
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise agrees to do so,
(2) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives
shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with
respect to the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing occurring or
that would be effective prior to the Closing (other than the "10b-5"
certifications and authorization letters contemplated by clause (viii) of this
_Section 6.17(a)_ and for the avoidance of doubt, the boards of directors
or other equivalent governing bodies of Parent, Merger Sub, and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall enter into or provide any resolutions, consents,
approvals or other closing arrangements on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be required by the Financing Sources pursuant to the
Commitment Letter at, or as of, the Closing), and (3) nothing shall obligate
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (a) take any action in respect of
the Financing to the extent that such action would cause any condition to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied by the Outside Date
or otherwise result in a breach of this Agreement by the Company, (b) take any
action to the extent such action would unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (c) issue in its
own name any bank information memoranda or high-yield offering prospectuses or
memoranda required in relation to the Financing (it being understood that any
such information memoranda or prospectus or memoranda shall reflect the
Surviving Corporation and all or certain of its Subsidiaries as obligors) or
(d) provide, or cause to be provided, any legal opinion by its counsel, or to
provide, or cause to be provided, any information or take, or cause to be
taken, any action to the extent it would reasonably be expected, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, to result in a violation of the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries organizational documents or applicable Law or
loss of any privilege.

(b) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in satisfying its obligations under this  _Section 6.17_ or
other cooperation provided by the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their respective Representatives) at the request of Parent (or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives).
Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of any thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with any action taken by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.17_ or other cooperation provided

Representatives) at the request of Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its or their respective Representatives) (other than the use of any
information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives for use in connection with the Financing), except
to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses,
fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement are
determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have arisen out of, or resulted from, the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether (except as expressly set forth below) before or
after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (with any termination by
Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June 9, 2019 (the
" _Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to
any party if its action or failure to act constitutes a breach or violation of
any of its obligations hereunder, and such breach has been the principal
cause of or directly resulted in (A) the failure to satisfy the conditions to
the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Article VII_ prior to the Outside Date or (B) the failure of the Closing to
occur by the Outside Date;

(ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such Order or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ if the failure of such party to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement resulted in the issuance of such Order or the taking of such other
action; or

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a
vote taken thereon at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

 



62

    

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in a failure of
any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ to be
satisfied and (B) either (1) is incapable of being cured by the Company by
the Outside Date or (2) if capable of being cured, has not been cured by the
Company within 30 days following written notice to the Company from Parent or
Merger Sub of such breach, which notice states Parents intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_; _provided_
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder; or

(ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall
have effected a Change of Board Recommendation; _provided_ that Parents right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) is only exercisable
prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained; or

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in a failure of
any condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ to be
satisfied and (B) either (1) is incapable of being cured by Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, by the Outside Date or (2) if capable of being cured,
has not been cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, within 30
following written notice to Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, from
the Company of such breach, which notice states the Companys intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_; _provided_
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder;

 

(ii) if (A) the Inside Date has passed and all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (except for
those conditions that by their nature or terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, which conditions were capable of being satisfied at the time of such
failure to consummate the Merger), (B) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
to Parent in writing that the Company is ready and willing to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (C) Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within
three Business Days following delivery of the Companys notice as a result of
Parents failure to receive the proceeds from the Financing; _provided_ that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ during such three Business Day period if the Outside Date
shall precede the expiration of such period; or

 

(iii) prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order for the
Company to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section 6.3_; _provided_ that concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to  _Section 8.3_.

 



63

    

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, the obligations of the parties shall
terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any party with
respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions of _Section
6.4_ (Access to Information) and the provisions of _Section 3.27_ (No Other
Representations and Warranties; Disclaimers), _Section 4.21_ (No Other
Representations and Warranties; Disclaimers), _Section 6.7_ (Expenses), 
_Section 6.9_ (Public Announcements), the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations under _Section 6.17(b)_ (Financing Cooperation), this _Section
8.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 8.3_ (Termination Fees) and _Article
IX_ (General Provisions), each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to Section _ 8.3(c)_, if such termination shall result from the
Willful Breach of this Agreement by any party or any intentional fraud by any
party, such party shall be fully liable for all damages that are the natural,
probable and reasonably foreseeable result thereof (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall, in the case of a breach by Parent or
Merger Sub, not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys
stockholders, which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the
Company) incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such
failure; _provided_ , further, that any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger in breach of this Agreement will be deemed to be a
Willful Breach by Parent and Merger Sub (whether or not Parent or Merger Sub
had sufficient funds available to consummate the Merger). Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger Subs obligations to hold
the Closing and consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub
obtaining the Financing. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in
this _Section 8.2 _shall be deemed to affect their right to specific
performance under _Section 9.9_. In addition, the parties agree that the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ (Change of Board Recommendation) or (ii) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ (Superior Proposal), then the Company shall
pay or cause to be paid to Parent (or its designees) a nonrefundable amount in
cash equal to $45,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent,
payable, in the case of clause (i), no later than two Business Days after the
date of such termination and, in the case of clause (ii), in advance of or
concurrently with such termination.

(b) In the event that, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date), and at such time the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ (other than  _Section 7.1(a)_) were satisfied, or _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ (Stockholder No Vote); (ii) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the date of termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date)) or the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_
(Stockholder No Vote)), an Acquisition Proposal was publicly proposed
or announced or otherwise communicated to the stockholders of the Company and
not withdrawn prior to the date of termination (in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date)) or the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ (Stockholder No Vote)); and (iii) within 12 months after the date
of such termination of this Agreement the Company enters into a definitive
written agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and the transaction
contemplated by such definitive agreement is later consummated, then on the
date such transaction is consummated, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent (or its designees) the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For
purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)_, each reference to "20%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%."

 



64

    

(c) The parties agree and understand that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent is
entitled to terminate this Agreement and to receive payment of the Termination
Fee from the Company pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_, except in the case of
intentional fraud, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub receives
any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement, and
thereafter Parent is entitled to receive the Termination Fee under this
_Section 8.3_, the amount of such Termination Fee shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub
in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement, and
that any amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ do not constitute a
penalty. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the amount due
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a judgment in
its favor, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, action or other proceeding,
together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum
equal to the prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_
on the date such interest begins accruing.

Section 8.4 _Procedure for Termination_. A terminating party shall
provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying the
Section or Sections pursuant to which such party is terminating the Agreement.
If more than one provision in _Section 8.1_ is available to a terminating
party in connection with a termination, a terminating party may rely on any
or all available provisions in _Section 8.1_ for any termination.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, clause, Annex,
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter, such reference shall be to a
Section or clause of or Annex or Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The phrase
"the date of this Agreement" and terms of similar import, shall be deemed to
refer to the date first written above. Whenever the content of this Agreement
permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders,
and a reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the other.

 



66

    

(b) References to any Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof. References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns
of that Person. References to any Law or statute are to that Law or statute,
as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. References to "$" and "dollars" are to the currency of the United
States. References from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified,
from and including or through and including, respectively. The words
"hereby," "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import refer to
this Agreement as a whole (including any disclosure letters delivered
herewith) and not merely to the specific Section, paragraph or clause in
which such word appears. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other theory extends and
such phrase shall not mean "if".

 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 

(d) No summary of this Agreement or any Exhibit attached hereto or Section of
a disclosure letter delivered herewith prepared by or on behalf of any party
shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any such
Exhibit or Section of a disclosure letter.

(e) Subject to the introductory language to _Article III_ and _Article IV_ ,
each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a Section of such disclosure letter that
corresponds to the Section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this
Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure thereof be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by electronic communication,
facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless
each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect, and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter, the Exhibits attached hereto and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, neither Parent and Merger Sub nor the

 



67

    

 Company makes any other representations or warranties, and each hereby
disclaims any other representations or warranties, express or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of any other information made by, or made
available by, itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in
connection with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to the other or the others Representatives of any documentation or
other information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

 

(b) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, except for: (i) only following
the Effective Time, the right of the Companys stockholders and holders of
Company Equity Awards, as applicable, to receive (x) the Merger Consideration
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.2_ and
(y) the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable or deliverable in
respect of Company Equity Awards pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (ii) the right of
the Company on behalf of its stockholders to seek equitable relief or to
pursue damages suffered by the Company and its stockholders (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall, in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub,
not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall
include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Companys stockholders, which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company), which right is
hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, (iii)
the right of the Indemnified Parties to enforce the provisions of _Section
6.8_ only and (iv) the right of each of the Financing Sources as an express
third-party beneficiary of this _Section 9.5(b)_, _Section 9.7_,  _Section
9.9(a)_, _Section 9.9(b)_ and _Section 9.11_ and the definition of
"Financing Source" and the constituent definitions thereof. The third-party
beneficiary rights referenced in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence may be
exercised only by the Company (on behalf of its stockholders as their agent)
through actions expressly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company,
and no stockholder of the Company, whether purporting to act in its capacity
as a stockholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise)
on behalf of the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause
the exercise of any such right.

 

(c) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement, directly or indirectly by operation of law
or otherwise, without the prior written consent of each other party hereto,
except that Parent may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to any Person after

parties (with respect to the Company and Merger Sub, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors), at any time before or after adoption of this

preceding sentence, this Agreement may be modified or amended solely by
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
respective parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) _Section 9.5(b)_ (Third Party Beneficiaries), this _Section

the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other

agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be

party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this
Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. 

Section 9.9 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 9.11_, this Agreement, and any dispute arising out of

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST A FINANCING SOURCE OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS

 CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS

AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.9(B)_.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to seek (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it at law and in equity, including monetary damages, except as
limited by _Section 8.3_) (i) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach and (ii) an Order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation without proof of
actual damages, and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond or other security in connection with such
remedy. Each party agrees not to raise any objections (including any defense
or counterclaim that there is an adequate remedy at law) to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.9(c)_. Each party further agrees
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.9(c)_, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to such party at law or in equity in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or thereby, (ii)
nothing set forth in this  _Section 9.9(c)_ shall require any party to
institute any Proceeding (or limit any partys right to institute any
Proceeding) for specific performance under this _Section 9.9(c)_ prior or as
a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ , nor
shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.9(c)_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.9(c)_ restrict or limit any partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article
VIII_ or pursue any other remedies (including monetary damages) in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or thereby that may
be available then or thereafter, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and (iii) that the prevailing
party in any such Proceeding shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs
and expenses associated with seeking such relief, including reasonable
attorneys fees. In the event that a party institutes a Proceeding seeking
equitable relief under this _Section 9.9(c)_, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended until the 20th Business Day following the date on
which such Proceeding is finally resolved (if the Outside Date would otherwise
occur on or prior to such date) or (ii) such other time period established by
the court presiding over such Proceeding.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 9.11_, each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits
itself to the personal jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which
an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including any Proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to _Section
9.9(c)_); (ii) agrees that every such Proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware);
(iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court;
(iv) agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby in any
other court; and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Proceeding so brought. Each party irrevocably consents to
the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in this  _Section 9.9(d)_ in any such Proceeding by mailing
copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to this
_Article IX_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not limit the

 



70

    

 right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any
other legally available method. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding in such court as provided
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 9.10 _Obligation of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 9.11 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Company, on behalf of itself and the Company Related
Parties, hereby (a) acknowledges that none of the Financing Sources shall have
any liability to the Company or any Company Related Party under this Agreement
or for any claim made by the Company or any Company Related Party based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute relating to, or arising from, the Debt Financing, the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, (b) waives any rights or claims
of any kind or nature (whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or

Financing Source relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (c) agrees not to commence
(and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to
assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing in this
_Section 9.11_ will limit the rights of Parent or Merger Sub or any Parent
Related Party in respect of the Debt Financing under any commitment letter
related thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or
damages of a tortious nature to a Company Related Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Parties to this
Agreement agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any Proceeding or claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or the Merger, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York or, if
under applicable law jurisdiction is vested in the Federal Courts, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate
courts thereof) and (ii) any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of laws rules thereof;
_provided_ that (i) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred, (ii) the determination of the accuracy of any representations
and warranties set forth herein and whether as a result of any inaccuracy
thereof Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has the right
to terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) the determination
of whether the transactions contemplated hereby have been consummated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed
by, and construed and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws rules thereof.
