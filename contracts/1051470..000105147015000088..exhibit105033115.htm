(a)Plans and Material Documents. Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedule

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, with respect to which the Company or
any Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or
former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii)
each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur
liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were
to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any
Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any
plans, programs, contracts, arrangements or understandings between the Seller
or any of its Affiliates and any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary,
including any plans, programs, contracts, arrangements or understandings
relating to the sale of the Company (collectively, the "Plans"). Except as set

sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Company Plans") is in writing
and, except with respect to any Company Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, the
Seller has furnished to the Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of each
Company Plan and a complete and accurate copy of each material document
prepared in connection with each such Company Plan, including a copy of (A)
each trust or other funding arrangement, (B) each summary plan description and
summary of material modifications, (C) the most recently filed IRS Form 5500,
(D) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such Company
Plan, and (E) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial

the Subsidiaries has any express or implied commitment, whether legally
enforceable or not, (I) to create, incur liability with respect to, or cause
to exist, any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (II) to
enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to
any individual, or (III) to modify, change or terminate any Company Plan,
other than with respect to a modification, change or termination required by
ERISA or the Code.



(b)Absence of Certain Types of Plans. Except as listed in Section 3.17(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company Plans is a multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer
Plan") or a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any Subsidiary could incur
liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan").
None of the Company Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability
or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any Subsidiary other than as required under Section
4980B of the Code or any similar applicable state or local law. Each of the
Company Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.

(c)Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 3.17(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, each Company Plan is now and always has been operated
in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of all applicable
Law, including ERISA and the Code, and, to the Seller's Knowledge, all Persons
who participate in the operation of such Company Plans and all Company Plan
"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have always acted
in all material respects in accordance with the provisions of all applicable
Law, including ERISA and the Code. To the Seller's Knowledge, the Company and
each Subsidiary has performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under, is not in any respect in default under or in violation of, and has no
Knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Company Plan. No
Action is pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened with respect to
any Company Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and
no fact or event exists that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such Action.

(d)Qualification of Certain Plans. Except with respect to any Company Plan
that is a Multiemployer Plan, each Company Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified
or has received an opinion or advisory letter from the IRS on which it may
rely, and each trust established in connection with any Company Plan that is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt or
has received an opinion or advisory letter from the IRS on which it may rely,
and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination,
opinion or advisory letter from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust. Each trust maintained or contributed to by the
Company or any Subsidiary that is intended to be qualified as a voluntary
employees' beneficiary association and that is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and so
exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination
by the IRS to adversely affect such qualified or exempt status.



(e)Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. To the Seller's Knowledge, there
has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Plan, which is not
otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, and that would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or a Subsidiary to any material liability.
None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for any
penalty or tax arising under Section 4971, 4972, 4980, 4980B or 6652 of the
Code or any liability under Section 502 of ERISA, and no fact or event exists
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability. None of
the Company and the Subsidiaries has incurred any liability under, arising out
of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
(ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and
no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such liability. No
complete or partial termination has occurred within the six years preceding
the date hereof with respect to any Company Plan. No reportable event (within
the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred or is expected to occur
with respect to any Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. Except with
respect to any Company Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, no Company Plan
failed to meet the minimum funding standards (within the meaning of Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the
most recently ended plan year of such Company Plan. None of the assets of the
Company or any Subsidiary is the subject of any lien arising under Section
302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code; none of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has been required to post any security under Section 307 of ERISA
or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code; and no fact or event exists which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such lien or requirement to post
any such security.

(f)Company Plan Contributions and Funding. All contributions, premiums or
payments required to be made with respect to any Company Plan have been made
on or before their due dates. With respect to any such contributions made by
the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Company Contributions"), such Company
Contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, and no deduction with respect to any Company
Contribution has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority,
and no fact or event exists that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such challenge or disallowance.

(g)Section 409A Plans. Section 3.17(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
each Company Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (each, a "Section 409A Plan"), and
identifies each Section 409A Plan in connection with which the Company or any
Subsidiary may have liability with respect to current or former employees,
contractors or directors.

(h)Controlled Group Liability. Except as set forth in Section 3.17(h) of the
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the Company and any other Commonly
Controlled Entity, there does not exist, nor do any circumstances exist that
would reasonably be



expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would reasonably be
expected to become a liability at or after the Closing of the Company, the
Purchaser or any Person that, together with the Purchaser, is treated as a
single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

(i)Change of Control Payments. Other than the Change of Control Payments,
there are no other change of control, bonus or other similar payments that are
payable to any employee of the Company or the Subsidiaries in connection with,
relating to or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreement (to the extent a party thereto), to carry out, as
applicable, its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by
each of the Purchaser and Parent of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreement
(to the extent a party thereto), the performance by each of the Purchaser and
Parent of, as applicable, its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation by each of the Purchaser and Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of each of the Purchaser and Parent, respectively
(including its stockholders, if applicable). This Agreement has been, and upon
its execution the Ancillary Agreement to which



the Purchaser is a party shall have been, duly executed and delivered by each
of the Purchaser and Parent, as applicable, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the Seller) this Agreement constitutes, and
upon its execution the Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is a party
shall constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the
Purchaser and Parent, as applicable, enforceable against the Purchaser and
Parent, respectively, in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject to the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding at Law or in equity).

SECTION 4.02. No Conflict. Assuming, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) below,
compliance with the pre-merger notification and waiting period requirements of
the HSR Act and the making and obtaining of all filings, notifications,
consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions referred to in Section
4.03, the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Purchaser and
Parent of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreement (to the extent a party
thereto) do not and will not (a) violate, conflict with or result in the
breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Purchaser or Parent, (b) conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental
Order applicable to the Purchaser or Parent or any of their respective assets,
properties or businesses, or (c) conflict with, or result in any breach of,
constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would become a default) under, require any consent under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension,
revocation or cancellation of, any note, bond, mortgage or indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or arrangement to which the Purchaser or Parent is a party, except,
in the case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not adversely affect the ability
of the Purchaser or Parent to carry out its obligations under, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreement.

SECTION 4.03. Governmental Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Purchaser and Parent of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is a party do not and will not
require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of, action by,
filing with, or notification to any Governmental Authority, except (a) the
pre-merger notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act and (b)
the filing of the FCC/State PUC Filings, and receipt of any required FCC/State
PUC Approvals.

financially and otherwise qualified under applicable Law (as in effect on the
date hereof) to, as of the Closing Date, acquire control of the Company
Communications Licenses and all assets and facilities authorized by the
Company Communications Licenses. There are no facts known to Parent or the
Purchaser, after due inquiry, that would disqualify either as the transferee
of the Company Communications Licenses, and no waiver or exemption, whether
temporary or permanent, of applicable Laws is necessary for the FCC/State PUC
Approvals to be obtained.



Parent and the Purchaser have no reason to believe, after due inquiry, that
the FCC/State PUC Filings might be challenged or might not be granted by the
FCC or the applicable State PUC in the ordinary course due to any fact or
circumstance relating to Parent or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or
any of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members or
partners.

SECTION 4.05. Investment Purpose. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. The Purchaser acknowledges that the
Shares are not registered under the Securities Act or any state securities
laws, and that the Shares may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to
the registration provisions of the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom and subject to state securities laws and regulations, as
applicable. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the
Shares for an indefinite period, and has sufficient knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

SECTION 4.06. Financing. The Purchaser (a) has access to sufficient funds
(including through availability of Parent or its Affiliates under their
respective credit or similar debt facilities), and (b) on the Closing Date,
will have sufficient cash in immediately available funds, to pay the Purchase
Price, to consummate all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
upon the terms contemplated hereby and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith and to satisfy all of its other obligations under this
Agreement.

SECTION 4.07. Litigation. No Action by or against the Purchaser or Parent is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser and Parent, threatened, which
could affect the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

SECTION 4.08. Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or the Purchaser.

SECTION 4.09. Solvency. Neither Parent nor the Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. After giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately
after the Closing, each of Parent, the Purchaser and their respective
subsidiaries (a) will be solvent (in that (i) the fair value of such Person's
assets will not be less than the sum of such Person's debts and (ii) the
present fair saleable value of such Person's assets will not be less than the
amount required to pay such Person's probable liability on such Person's
existing debts as they mature or become due), (b) will not have unreasonably
small capital with which to engage in such Person's business and (c) will not
have incurred debts beyond such Person's ability to pay as they mature or
become due.

SECTION 4.10. Independent Investigation. Parent and the Purchaser have
conducted their own independent investigation, review and analysis of the
business, results of operations, financial condition and assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries. Each of Parent



and the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in making its decision to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it
has relied solely upon its own investigation and the Seller Representations.
Each of Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
Seller Representations, (a) none of the Seller, the Company and the
Subsidiaries or any other Person is making or has made any other express or
implied representation or warranty, either written or oral, on behalf of the
Seller, Nova NextGen Solutions or the Company or any Subsidiary, including any
representation or warranty as to the Business or the accuracy or completeness
of any information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries furnished or
made available to the Purchaser and Parent and their directors, officers,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, counsel, accountants and other
agents (including any information, documents or material made available to
Parent or the Purchaser in the electronic documentation site established on
behalf of the Seller containing certain due diligence documentation,
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), as to any projections, estimates or budgets
pertaining to the Company or any Subsidiary or as to the future revenue,
expenses, expenditures, profitability or success of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any representation or warranty arising from statute or
otherwise in Law and (b) it has not been induced by and is not relying upon
any other representations or warranties that may have been made by any Person,
and acknowledges and agrees that the Seller has specifically disclaimed and
does hereby specifically disclaim any such other representation or warranty
made by any Person. The Purchaser is acquiring the Company subject only to the
specific Seller Representations, as further limited by the specifically
bargained-for exclusive remedies as set forth in Article IX.

SECTION 5.02. Access to Information.

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the time of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, upon
reasonable notice, the Seller shall cause each of its officers, employees,
agents, representatives, accountants and counsel, and shall cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries and each of the Company's and the Subsidiaries' officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel to: (i)
afford the officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel, financing
sources and representatives of Parent and the Purchaser reasonable access,
during normal business hours, under reasonable circumstances and at mutually
agreed locations, to the offices, properties, plants, other facilities, books
and records of the Company and each Subsidiary and to those officers,
employees, agents, accountants and counsel of any of the Seller, the Company
or the Subsidiaries who have knowledge relating to any of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or their Business and (ii) furnish to the officers, employees,
agents, accountants, counsel, financing sources and representatives of Parent
and the Purchaser such additional financial and operating data and other
information (to the extent in the possession of the Seller or the Company or a
Subsidiary) regarding the assets, properties, liabilities and goodwill of the
Company, the Subsidiaries and their Business (or legible copies thereof) as
Parent and the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller shall
not be required to provide any such access or disclose any such information to
the Purchaser or Parent or any such other person if such disclosure would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Seller based on advice of outside counsel, (A)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (B) create any
undue risk of violating any applicable Law, including antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to make
reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure



arrangements which would allow it to disclose to Parent and the Purchaser
information of the types described in clauses (A) and (B) above without
waiving any legal privilege or creating any undue risk of violating any
applicable Law, as applicable. Without limitation of Section 5.01, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
to give to Parent or the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, any rights to
control or direct the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the
Closing Date, and (y) prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision of the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries. Parent
and the Purchaser hereby agree that they are not authorized to and shall not
(and shall not permit any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
employees, officers, counsel, accountants, consultants, financing sources or
other representatives or agents to) contact any competitor, supplier,
distributor, or customer of the Company, any Subsidiary or Nova NextGen
Solutions with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of
the Seller and, if the Seller so elects, only in the presence of an agent or
representative specified by the Seller.

(b)In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates in respect of the Company or the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, in respect of Nova NextGen Solutions or for
any other reasonable purpose, including the Seller's SEC reporting
obligations, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall (i) retain the books and records relating to the Company, the
Subsidiaries, their Business and their operations (and, to the extent not
retained by the Seller, and in the possession of the Company or the
Subsidiaries, any books and records relating to Nova NextGen Solutions and its
business and operations) relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees,
agents and representatives of the Seller reasonable access (including the
right to make, at the Seller's expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, under reasonable circumstances and at mutually agreed locations, to
such books and records. After the Closing, the Seller may, upon reasonable
notice to Parent, during regular business hours, contact the Company and the
Subsidiaries directly to request information as may reasonably be required to
resolve any matter related to Nova NextGen Solutions; provided that such
requests do not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Company and the Subsidiaries.

(c)In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary after the
Closing or for any other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years
following the Closing Date, the Seller shall (i) retain the books and records
of the Seller which relate to the Company, the Subsidiaries, their Business
and their operations or to Nova NextGen Solutions and its operations for
periods prior to the Closing and which shall not otherwise have been delivered
to Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary and (ii) upon
reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees, agents and representatives
of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or a Subsidiary reasonable access
(including the right to



make photocopies, at the expense of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or such
Subsidiary, as applicable), during normal business hours, under reasonable
circumstances and at mutually agreed locations, to such books and records.

(d)From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the time of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and, in any event, within 15 Business
Days, after the end of each calendar month, the Seller shall deliver (or shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to deliver) to Parent and the Purchaser
consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Subsidiaries for
such calendar month in form consistent with the Financial Statements; provided
that such obligation does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

(e)Following the Closing, Parent and the Purchaser will, and will cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to ensure that the
reporting timelines and procedures, including the delivery of all applicable
financial information to the Seller, adhered to by the Company and the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and as required by the Seller as part of its
monthly closing process are complied with in all material respects for the
Seller's reporting period that includes the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) Parent and the Purchaser will cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to submit to the Seller a Hyperion trial balance and an Essbase
work-in-process file and will use reasonable efforts to cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries to submit to the Seller a monthly representations letter and
management questionnaire substantially similar in form and content as the
files and materials previously submitted by the Company and the Subsidiaries
and (ii) after the Closing, the Seller and its auditors may, upon reasonable
notice to Parent, during regular business hours, contact the Company and the
Subsidiaries directly to request financial and other information as may
reasonably be required to satisfy applicable auditor requests or to comply
with the Seller's standard closing procedures or internal controls function as
required for the period ending on the fiscal month-end that includes the
Closing Date as contemplated by this Section 5.02; provided that such requests
do not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.03. Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
(i) the Non-Disclosure Agreement remains in full force and effect and (ii) the
Non-Disclosure Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
from and after the Closing. From and after the Closing Date until (except with
respect to trade secrets) the date that is three years after the Closing Date,
the Seller shall, and shall cause its agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers and directors to: (a) except as provided in clause (c)
below, treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to
any Person to) all information relating to trade secrets, processes, Owned
Intellectual Property (including patent applications), product development,
price, customer and supplier lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and
strategies, details of client and consultant contracts, operations methods,
product development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel
acquisition plans and all other confidential or proprietary information with
respect to the Company and each Subsidiary



and their Business; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller, its Affiliates and their respective agents, representatives,
employees, officers and directors shall be free to use any information
retained in their unaided memory (including general ideas, concepts, know-how
or techniques contained therein) other than where such use is expressly in
violation of another provision of this Agreement, provided that they shall
maintain the confidentiality of the information subject to the foregoing
confidentiality restrictions and the foregoing shall not be deemed to grant to
the Seller, their Affiliates or any of their respective agents,
representatives, employees, officers or directors a license, (b) in the event
that the Seller or any such agent, representative, Affiliate, employee,
officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose any such
information, provide Parent with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or a Subsidiary may seek a protective
order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section 5.03, (c) in the
event that such protective order or other remedy is not timely obtained, or
Parent waives compliance with this Section 5.03, furnish only that portion of
such confidential information which is legally required to be provided and
exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information, and (d) promptly furnish (prior
to, at, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing) to the Company,
Parent or the Purchaser any and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of all
such confidential information then in the possession of the Seller or any of
its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors or,
except as otherwise required or permitted by Section 5.02(c) or to the extent
necessary to comply with any applicable Laws, rules or regulations, destroy
any and all additional copies then in the possession of the Seller or any of
its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors of
such information and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents
prepared, in whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not apply to any information that (A) at the time of
disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this
Agreement or the Non-Disclosure Agreement by the Seller, its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors or (B) is
lawfully obtained or developed by the Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective agents, representatives, employees, officers or directors
from and after the Closing from sources which are not legally or contractually
prohibited from disclosing such information; and provided further that, with
respect to Intellectual Property, specific detailed information shall not be
deemed to be within the foregoing exception (A) merely because a principle of
operation is embraced in general disclosures in the public domain. In
addition, with respect to Intellectual Property, any combination of features
shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exception (A) merely because
the individual features are in the public domain unless the combination itself
and its principle of operation are in the public domain.

SECTION 5.04. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

(a)Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and the Seller shall
cause each of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable efforts
to obtain (or enable the Company and the Subsidiaries to obtain) all
authorizations, consents, orders, waivers and approvals under the HSR Act, all
FCC/State PUC Approvals and all other authorizations, consents, orders,
waivers and approvals of Governmental Authorities and



officials that may be or become necessary for the execution and delivery of,
and the performance of all obligations pursuant to, and the consummation of
all transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreement
(the "Governmental Filings"), and each party will cooperate fully with the
other parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders, waivers and approvals. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Seller
also shall (including, with respect to the Seller, by causing the Company and
the Subsidiaries to) file with the appropriate Governmental Authorities in a
timely manner all notices required by applicable Law in connection with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Subject to Section 5.04(c) with respect to FCC/State PUC Filings,
each party hereto shall pay all filing fees or other similar amounts required
to be paid by it in connection with the submission of any Governmental Filing
by such party.

(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 5.04(a), Parent and the
Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Reporting Form
pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any
event, within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Each such
party shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The Purchaser and Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to
make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable federal or state
antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the acquisition of the Shares so as to enable the Closing Date to occur as
promptly as practicable and, in any event, no later than the End Date;
provided, however, that the Purchaser and Parent shall not be required to take
any action that would, alone or in conjunction with any other actions required
in connection with any HSR Act, FCC or State PUC review, (i) have (A) a
Material Adverse Effect or (B) a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) involve the sale, divestiture, licensing,
holding separate, or other disposition (and whether through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets, operations, businesses, divisions, or
customers of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) prevent the Purchaser
and the Company and Subsidiaries from operating following the Closing in any
state in which they currently operate. The Seller, Parent, the Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or comparable
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except with
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

(c)In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 5.04(a), the parties shall
prepare and file the FCC/State PUC Filings as promptly as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, within 30 calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, and any other necessary or appropriate instruments or documents (in
each case, in a form mutually approved by the parties, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned



or delayed). Thereafter, the parties shall prosecute the applicable FCC/State
PUC Filings with all reasonable diligence to obtain the requisite FCC/State
PUC Approvals. Each party shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
to the FCC or the appropriate State PUC any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by such Governmental Authority in
connection with the FCC/State PUC Filings. Each party shall be solely
responsible to pay its expenses with respect to the preparation, filing and
prosecution of the FCC/State PUC Filings, except that Parent shall pay all of
the filing fees in connection with the FCC/State PUC Filings or reimburse the
Seller for its payment of any such fees as Reimbursable Expenses. The parties
shall cooperate to oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with
respect to the FCC/State PUC Filings to the extent such petition or objection
relates to such party. Each party shall use reasonable efforts not to (i) take
any action that would, or (ii) fail to take any action the failure of which to
take would, reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying
the receipt of the FCC/State PUC Approvals. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the time of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article X, Parent and the Purchaser shall maintain the
qualifications necessary to hold the Company Communications Licenses.

(d)Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Section 5.04
and permit the other party to review in advance (and shall consider any
comments made by the reviewing party in relation to) any proposed
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority relating to such
matters. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in
any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any submissions, filings, investigations, or any other
inquiry relating to such matters unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party (or their external legal counsel in order to address any concerns
relating to confidential or competitively sensitive information) the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, provide each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party hereto; provided, however, that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of

arrangements or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(e)The Seller shall, or shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, give
promptly such notices to third parties and use its or their reasonable efforts

(f)Parent and the Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to
assist the Seller in giving such notices and obtaining such consents and

neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall have any obligation to give any
guarantee or other consideration of any nature in connection with any such
notice, consent or estoppel certificate or to consent to any change in the
terms of any agreement or arrangement which Parent or the Purchaser in their
sole discretion may deem materially adverse to the interests of Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary or their Business.

(g)The Seller, Parent and the Purchaser agree that, in the event that any
consent, approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the
Company or any Subsidiary or their Business any right or benefit under any
lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to

Contract) or is otherwise entitled to the benefit of is not obtained prior to

shall use its reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser or the Company or
such Subsidiary, as the case may be, with the rights and benefits of the
affected lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or
arrangement for the term of such lease, license, contract or other agreement
or arrangement, and, if the Seller provides such rights and benefits, the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
and burdens thereunder.

otherwise displayed on any materials acquired by Parent and the Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

prior to the Closing.

(c)As promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later
than six months after the Closing Date, Parent and the Purchaser shall cause

change of name or to terminate its qualification in such jurisdiction under
such name.

such matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the
Closing, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.06(a) shall

Affiliates may have against the Purchaser or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

stockholders), and each of their respective individual, joint or mutual, past
and present officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents,
successors and assigns in their respective capacities as such (collectively,
the "Seller Releasees") from any and all Claims, demands, actions,

prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing or on account of or arising out
of any such matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or prior
to the Closing, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted
after, the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
5.06(b) shall in any way limit or otherwise restrict any rights Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates may have against the Seller or its
Affiliates arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

SECTION 5.07. Intercompany Arrangements. At or prior to the Closing, the
Seller shall cause any contract or agreement described in clause (i) of the
definition of "Excluded Contract" to be terminated or otherwise amended or
modified to exclude the Company and the



Subsidiaries as a party thereto (with respect to any such contracts or
agreements that constitute Credit Support Instruments, to the extent that
Parent and the Purchaser have satisfied their obligations pursuant to Section
5.10 with respect thereto and, to such extent, in accordance with Section
5.10). Except as provided otherwise by Section 5.10, the Seller shall bear all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such termination, amendment
or modification described in the immediately preceding sentence. The
Intercompany Indebtedness described in clause (ii) of the definition of

SECTION 5.10. Release from Credit Support Instruments.

(a)At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and Parent shall use reasonable
efforts (and the Seller shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to assist
Parent and the Purchaser) to (i) secure the unconditional release, as of the
Closing Date, of the Seller and its Affiliates (including, if applicable, the
Company and Subsidiaries) from the credit support instruments relating to the
Company and the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule and any Additional Credit Support Instruments (collectively, the
"Credit Support Instruments") and the removal of the Company and Subsidiaries
as parties to the Retained Credit Instruments, including effecting such
release and removal by entering into the alternative arrangements described in
the following clause (ii), and (ii) enter into alternative arrangements
(including guarantees or other credit support) so that Parent and the
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of the Purchaser) or a surety or letter of credit
issuer for the benefit of Parent and the Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for the obligations of such Credit Support Instruments in respect of the
Company and the Subsidiaries; provided, however, that in no event shall
reasonable efforts require the Purchaser or its Affiliates to (A) agree to
change the terms of any Material Contract to which such credit support applies
in any manner that is materially adverse to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries), (B) agree to any
material restriction in the operations of their respective businesses
(including the Business) except for covenants and restrictions that are



customary in connection with such Credit Support Instruments or such other
credit support documentation contemplated by this Section 5.10 or (C) make any

to the terms of the replacement parent guarantees, replacement surety bonds or
replacement letters of credit obtained on behalf of Parent and its Affiliates
or other credit support required in connection with surety bonds or letters of
credit of Parent and its Affiliates, including the Company and the
Subsidiaries at and after the Closing), other than immaterial and de minimis
payments or expenditures and ordinary processing and administrative fees and
legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the alternative
arrangements contemplated by clause (ii) above. All such payments or
expenditures incurred in connection with any alternative arrangements entered
into by Parent and the Purchaser in accordance with Section 5.10(a)(ii) shall
be borne by Parent and the Purchaser. To the extent the parties have been
unable to obtain the unconditional release of the Seller and its Affiliates
from the Credit Support Instruments and the removal of the Company and
Subsidiaries as parties to the Retained Credit Instruments in accordance with
clause (i) above prior to the Closing and the Closing occurs, (x) Parent and
the Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses relating to the
Company or any Subsidiary in respect of obligations arising from or relating
to such Credit Support Instruments and (y) the Purchaser and Parent shall
continue to use reasonable efforts (and the Seller shall cooperate and
continue to use reasonable efforts to assist Parent and the Purchaser) to
secure such release of the Seller and its Affiliates from such Credit Support
Instruments and the removal of the Company and Subsidiaries as parties to the
Retained Credit Instruments as contemplated by this Section 5.10 as promptly
as reasonably practicable.

(b)At or prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use reasonable efforts (and
Parent and the Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to assist
the Seller) to secure the unconditional release, as of the Closing Date, of
the Company and the Subsidiaries from, and the removal, as of the Closing
Date, of the Company and the Subsidiaries as parties to, each of (i) the
Seller Credit Facility and any security, pledge or other agreement entered
into by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection therewith and (ii) the
Seller Surety Bond Facility and other Surety Credit Documents (as defined in
the Seller Surety Bond Facility) other than the Credit Support Instruments
(collectively, the "Retained Credit Instruments"); provided, however, that in
no event shall reasonable efforts require the Seller to make any payments or
expenditures, other than immaterial and de minimis payments or expenditures
and ordinary processing and administrative fees and legal and other
professional fees. Any such payments or expenditures incurred by the Seller in
connection with securing the release of the Company and the Subsidiaries from
the Retained Credit Instruments shall be borne by the Seller. To the extent
the parties have been unable to obtain such release for any Retained Credit
Instrument prior to the Closing and the Closing occurs, (i) the Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Purchaser and their Affiliates from
and against any and all Losses relating to the Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) in respect of obligations
arising from or relating to such Retained Credit Instruments of the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) and (ii)
the Seller shall



continue to use reasonable efforts (and Parent and the Purchaser shall
cooperate and continue to use reasonable efforts to assist the Seller) to
secure the unconditional release of the Company and the Subsidiaries from such
Retained Credit Instruments as promptly as reasonably practicable.

(c)In the event that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
earlier of the time of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article X, the Seller or its Affiliates shall, to the extent
permitted in accordance with Section 5.01(b)(xvii) and in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice, enter into any Additional
Credit Support Instruments that constitute parent guarantees on behalf of or
for the benefit of the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Seller and its
Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts to, to the extent possible, enter into
such definitive agreements or other documentation with respect thereto as
shall permit, as of the Closing Date and without any additional payments or
expenditures by the parties hereto, (i) Parent or the Purchaser (or an
Affiliate of the Purchaser) to assume or otherwise become solely responsible
for the obligations of such Additional Credit Support Instrument in respect of
credit support for the Company and the Subsidiaries and (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) to be unconditionally
released therefrom.

SECTION 5.11. Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company and Subsidiaries now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company
or any Subsidiary, as provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws,
limited liability company agreement or other governing instrument of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the
date hereof and disclosed in Section 5.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms.

(b)Parent and the Purchaser shall either (i) cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to obtain as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of six years from the Closing Date, with aggregate coverage in
the amount set forth in Section 5.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company and Subsidiaries, as the policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Seller for the
benefit of the Company or such Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (a correct and complete copy of which has been made available to
Parent and the Purchaser), or (ii) maintain in effect for a period of six
years after the Closing Date, for the benefit of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, the policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
currently maintained by Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable, so long as
such policies provide at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the



Company or such Subsidiary, when compared to the insurance maintained by the
Seller for the benefit of the Company or such Subsidiary as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(c)The obligations of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company and Subsidiaries
under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any director or officer to whom this Section 5.11
applies without the consent of such affected director or officer (it being
expressly agreed that the directors and officers to whom this Section 5.11
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.11, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.11).

(d)In the event that Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in either
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

SECTION 5.12. Disclosure Schedule. Inclusion of any item in the Disclosure
Schedule: (a) does not represent a determination by the Seller that such item
is material, nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality now
or in the future (it being the intent that the Seller shall not be penalized
for having disclosed more than may be required by the applicable provision of
this Agreement), (b) does not represent a determination by the Seller that
such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business and (c) shall not
constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission of liability concerning such item
by the Seller. The information disclosed in each Section of the Disclosure
Schedule (i) is intended to qualify the representations and warranties
contained in Article III of this Agreement referencing or corresponding with
such Section of the Disclosure Schedule, the covenants contained in this
Article V referencing or corresponding with such Section of the Disclosure
Schedule, and the other provisions of this Agreement referencing or
corresponding with such Section of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) shall not
be deemed to expand in any way the scope of any of such representations,
warranties or covenants on the part of the Seller. Information disclosed in
any Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute disclosure for
purposes of each other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
would also qualify such other Section of this Agreement. Nothing in the
Disclosure Schedule constitutes an admission of any liability or obligation of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates, including the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, to any third Person, or an admission to any third Person against
the interest of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, including the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries. Any item or information disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule is provided confidentially on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, (A) the Seller shall reasonably
promptly notify the Purchaser if the Seller obtains knowledge that any of the
representations or warranties made by the Seller in this



Agreement were not true and correct in all material respects or of any
material errors in, or omissions from, the Disclosure Schedule and (B) Parent
and the Purchaser shall reasonably promptly notify the Seller if any of them
obtains knowledge that any of the representations or warranties made by such
party in this Agreement were not true and correct in all material respects.
For the avoidance of doubt, no disclosure by any party pursuant to this
Section 5.12 shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
to prevent or cure any breach of any representation or warranty and no such
disclosure shall be considered in determining whether any of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.02 have been satisfied.

SECTION 5.13. Rights to Attorney-Client Privileged Communications; Waiver of
Conflicts. It is acknowledged and agreed by all parties, by and on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates, that Duane Morris LLP and
Wilkinson Barker Knauer, LLP (collectively, "Pre-Closing Counsel") have
represented the interests of the Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Purchaser and Parent, by and on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates, and, subsequent to the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiaries, agree that any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection, and expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of Pre-
Closing Counsel's representation of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Seller
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
communications, information and documents covered by such privilege or
protection, shall belong exclusively to and be controlled exclusively by the
Seller and such privileges may not be waived by or on behalf of the Company or
any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the transfer of Shares as contemplated
hereunder, none of such privileges and protections, communications,
information or documents covered by such privileges or protections shall pass
to or be claimed by the Purchaser, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary on or
after the Closing. Notwithstanding any current or prior representation of the
Company or any Subsidiary by Pre-Closing Counsel, such Pre-Closing Counsel
shall be allowed to represent the Seller and its Affiliates in existing or
future matters or disputes adverse to the Purchaser, Parent, the Company or
any Subsidiary relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser and Parent, for and on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates, and, on and after the Closing, the Company and the
Subsidiaries, hereby (i) waive any conflicts that may arise in connection with
such representation and (ii) agree that Pre-Closing Counsel may represent the
Seller and its Affiliates in any such matter or dispute, even though the
interests of the Seller or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to the
interest of the Purchaser, Parent and their respective Affiliates, and on and
after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.14. Closing. From the date hereof until the Closing, each party
hereto shall use reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to
expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof.

SECTION 5.15. Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement



and the Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

SECTION 5.16. Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the time of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article X, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates, officers, employees,
directors, agents or other representatives will (a) solicit, initiate,
encourage or accept any other inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person
relating to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any
discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with any
Person regarding, or furnish to any Person other than Parent any information
with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to seek to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or (c) enter into any agreement or
arrangement with any Person for or with respect to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal.

SECTION 5.17. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a)In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to the Seller and in
order to induce Parent and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the
Seller hereby covenants and agrees that, effective upon the Closing, for a
period of three years following the date of this Agreement, neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of Parent,
directly or indirectly, own more than 5% of the outstanding Capital Stock of
or a controlling interest in, or manage, operate or act in a similar
arrangement for (in each case, other than solely in the capacity of an owner
of 5% or less of the outstanding Capital Stock of), any other Person that does
the following (collectively, "Competitor Business"): (i) leases, subleases,
licenses, grants an indefeasible right of use, rents or otherwise sells or
grants any rights to use fiber optic cabling or networks, whether as dark
fiber or as lit services, or (ii) offers, sells or provides any bandwidth
services (including wavelength or similar services) or fiber optic networks,
in each case to commercial, non-profit or K-12 customers in any of the
counties where the Assets are located as of the Closing Date as set forth in
Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure Schedule or any counties adjacent thereto;
provided that the restrictions contained in this Section 5.17(a) shall not
restrict the Seller or any of its Affiliates from (A) performing their
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (B) acquiring
any Person or business that (x) subject to the limitation set forth in clause
(y) below, primarily provides electric power or gas utility services (whether
organized as a utility, cooperative or otherwise) or (y) engages in any
Competitor Business, so long as such Competitor Business does not contribute
more than 25% of the average of the sum of (1) the operating income and (2)
depreciation and amortization of such acquired Person or business on a
consolidated basis for the two completed fiscal years immediately preceding
the date of the definitive agreement to enter into the acquisition, (C)

using any third party to engineer, plan, design, build or maintain, any asset

rights, customer bankruptcy or other settlement with respect to any planning,
designing, building, construction or maintenance services provided for a

aggregate in any fiscal year of the Seller.

(b)In consideration of the benefits of this Agreement to the Seller and in
order to induce Parent and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the
Seller hereby covenants and agrees that, effective upon the Closing, for a
period of three years following the date of this Agreement, neither the Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of Parent,
directly or indirectly solicit any officer of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any manager or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary (each, a "Restricted
Person") to terminate his or her employment with the Company or such
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions in the immediately
preceding sentence shall not apply to the placement of general advertisements
or the use of general search firm services with respect to a particular
geographic or technical area, but which are not targeted, directly or
indirectly, towards any Restricted Persons.

(c)The Seller acknowledges and agrees that Parent and the Purchaser, in
addition to any other rights and remedies each such party may have at law or
in equity, shall be entitled to seek an order of specific performance,
injunction, restraining order or such other temporary, preliminary or
permanent equitable relief restraining a breaching party from committing any
violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 5.17,
without the necessity of posting a bond or any other financial assurance. If
any provision of this Section 5.17 shall be adjudged to be excessively broad
as to duration, geographic scope, activity or subject, or is held to be
unreasonable, arbitrary, against public policy or an otherwise unenforceable
restriction with respect to any particular jurisdiction, the parties hereto
intend that such provision(s) shall be deemed modified to the minimum degree
necessary to make such provision(s) valid and enforceable under applicable Law
and that such modified provision(s) shall thereafter be enforced to the
fullest extent possible. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
from the non-prevailing party or parties any and all fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the prevailing party in any
Action to enforce this Section 5.17. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(i) the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.17 are part of the essence of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) Parent and the
Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement but for the inclusion of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.17. The Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.17 are reasonable as
to duration, geographic scope, activity and subject and are necessary to
protect the business and financial interest of Parent and the Purchaser
acquired pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 5.18. Excluded Equity Interests. Prior to the Closing, the Seller
shall cause the Company and any applicable Subsidiaries to distribute,
transfer or otherwise



convey to the Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than the Company or any

the Seller and reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Purchaser (the

supporting documentation), prior to Closing, setting forth the Reporting
Firm's calculation of the amount of Company EandP (the "Company EandP Report"),
and Parent and the Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to

the Company EandP Report (including the supporting documentation with respect
thereto) no later than the date that is three Business Days prior to the

conclusions used in the preparation of, or to be reflected in, the Company EandP
Report. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the
Seller shall have no Liability for any Losses arising from or relating to the
Company EandP Report, the calculation of Company EandP or the use of or reliance
on the Company EandP Report by any of Parent, the Purchaser and their
Affiliates.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01. Benefits.

(a)As of the Closing Date, each then-current employee of the Company and the
Subsidiaries (a "Transferred Employee") shall cease to be covered by the Plans
(other than the Company Plans) and shall be covered by the employee benefit
plans of Parent. The medical, dental and health plans of Parent applicable to
each Transferred Employee (A) shall not contain any exclusions for pre-
existing conditions (other than conditions which barred coverage under the
corresponding Plans), (B) shall cover as of the Closing Date each Transferred
Employee (including any dependents) who was covered by a comparable Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (C) shall credit each Transferred
Employee for the plan year of the Seller in which the Closing Date occurs with
all deductibles and co-payments applicable to the portion of such plan year
occurring prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Parent shall grant each
Transferred Employee full credit for all periods of employment with the
Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries for eligibility, vesting and accrual
purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent applicable to such
Transferred Employee (except that this sentence shall not obligate Parent to
grant benefit accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan for any
period of employment occurring prior to the Closing Date); provided, however,
that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit to
any such employee



or the funding for any such benefit. The Seller shall retain, and shall
indemnify Parent and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company
and the Subsidiaries), from and against (x) all Controlled Group Liability
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, all liabilities or potential
liabilities disclosed on Section 3.17(h) of the Disclosure Schedule), and (y)
all liabilities with respect to the Plans (other than the Company Plans), in
respect of each of clauses (x) and (y), regardless of whether arising from or
relating to periods occurring before or after the Closing.

(b)Parent will accept, maintain and pay out, in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and in accordance with the terms of relevant Plan, the 2015
incentive bonus plans and practices that the Seller and the Company and
Subsidiaries have in place with respect to the applicable participants at the
Company and Subsidiaries (with the cash portion of such Plans paid in cash and
the stock portion to be granted under such plans paid, at Parent's option, in
cash or Parent stock), provided that the amounts in respect of such Plans have
been reflected in the Financial Statements and accrued as a current liability
of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

(c)Parent will be responsible for any obligation with respect to the
Transferred Employees under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act or similar law, rule or regulation and for any obligations or liabilities
relating to any termination of the Transferred Employees arising or accruing
on or after the Closing Date.

(d)The parties agree that Change of Control Payments in the aggregate amount
determined and calculated in accordance with Section 1.01(v) of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be paid to such employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries,
and in such amounts and in such manner of consideration, as set forth on
Section 1.01(v) of the Disclosure Schedule, and the Seller shall take such
actions with respect thereto as are specified on Section 1.01(v) of the
Disclosure Schedule; provided that each such employee who is due to receive
any Change of Control Payment shall be required to enter into a customary
release, substantially in the form set forth in Section 6.01(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, provided by Parent prior to and in connection with such
employee's receipt of such Change of Control Payment. Following the Closing
Date, Parent and the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company or a
Subsidiary to, pay all Change of Control Payments (except for any Change of
Control Payments that were paid at or prior to the Closing) in full.

(e)The Seller shall cooperate with Parent and the Purchaser and use reasonable
efforts to assist Parent and the Purchaser in their efforts, in connection
with the Closing, to have each Transferred Employee execute and complete the
customary onboarding documentation (including a confidentiality and non-
compete agreement) of Parent and otherwise acknowledge and become bound by
Parent's customary employment policies that apply to similarly situated
employees of Parent.

(f)Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no provision of
this Agreement shall (i) create any third party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any



person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Transferred Employee) other
than the parties hereto or any right to employment or continued employment or
to a particular term or condition of employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) be construed or deemed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement, or (iii) limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them.

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01. Indemnity.

(a)The Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company and each Subsidiary from and against any and all Losses arising out of
or resulting from Excluded Taxes.

(b)Where permitted by applicable Law, the Seller and the Purchaser agree to
cause the Company and each Subsidiary to terminate its taxable period as of
the end of the Closing Date. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

(i)in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets
of the Company or a Subsidiary (e.g., property Taxes), deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

(ii)in the case of any other Taxes (including any Taxes based upon income,
receipts or payroll but other than Conveyance Taxes, which are the subject of
Section 7.07), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended on the Closing Date. In the case of any Tax based upon or
measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(b) shall
be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in
a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

(iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of any
expenses or costs (including any compensation or bonuses) incurred by the
Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the



transactions contemplated under this Agreement, in each case to the extent
deductible under applicable Law, shall be taken as a deduction on the Tax
Returns filed by or with respect to the Company and Subsidiaries for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Tax Returns
filed for a Straddle Period, such deductions shall be allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. For this purpose, the safe
harbor of Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746 shall be applied in
determining the deductible amount of "success-based fees."

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
the Seller shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification for Non-
Income Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01(a), unless and until the aggregate
amount of Non-Income Taxes which may be recovered from the Seller equals or
exceeds $100,000 whereupon Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent of the
amount, if any, that exceeds $100,000, (ii) the Seller shall not be liable for
any claim for indemnification for Taxes attributable to actions taken by, or
at the direction of, Parent, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates that are
effective on the Closing Date and not contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
the maximum amount of Excluded Taxes (other than any Taxes of the Seller or
any consolidated combined, unitary, affiliated or similar group of which the
Seller is the common parent) which may be recovered from the Seller under
Section 7.01(a) shall be an amount equal to 25% of the Purchase Price and, in
the case of any Taxes of the Seller or any consolidated, combined, unitary,
affiliated or similar group of which the Seller is the common parent, shall be
the Purchase Price.

(d)The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates against Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries for any Post-
Closing Period and, with respect to any Straddle Period, any such Taxes that
are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date as determined under Section 7.01(b), in each case except for
Taxes for which the Seller is obligated to indemnify Parent, the Purchaser,
the Company or a Subsidiary under Section 7.01(a).

SECTION 7.02. Returns and Payments.

(a)After the Closing, the Seller, at its sole expense, shall prepare and file
or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Authority
(or cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax
Returns (including Income Tax Returns) that are not Stand-Alone Returns for
any Pre-Closing Period and any Straddle Period and all Income Tax Returns that
are Stand-Alone Returns for any Pre-Closing Period, in each case relating to
the Company and the Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date (taking into account applicable extensions). Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, such Tax Returns of the Company and the
Subsidiaries (or, in the case of any Tax Return filed on a consolidated,
combined, unitary or affiliated basis, with respect to the portion of any such
return related to the Company and the Subsidiaries) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past



practices employed with respect to the Seller, the Company and the
Subsidiaries. With respect to any Income Tax Return that is a Stand-Alone
Return, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser and its authorized
representatives with a copy of such completed Stand-Alone Return, together
with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20 Business
Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of
such Stand-Alone Return, and the Purchaser and its authorized representatives
shall have the right to review and comment on such Stand-Alone Return prior to
the filing of such Stand-Alone Return, provided that in the case of a Stand-
Alone Return that is due within 30 Business Days after the Closing Date
(including extensions thereof), the Seller shall provide a copy of such Stand-
Alone Return (along with supporting information and schedules) and the
Purchaser shall review and comment, as soon as practical before the filing due
date. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree with respect to
comments made by the Purchaser, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit any
such dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm which shall resolve any such
dispute, and the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding. If the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to
resolve the dispute at least three Business Days prior to the filing due date
of the Stand-Alone Return at issue, such Stand-Alone Return shall be filed as
prepared by the Seller, subject to subsequent amendment as may be necessary to
reflect the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm and the obligations of
the parties hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by the Seller and
one-half by the Purchaser.

(b)Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02(a), the Purchaser (or, if
applicable, Parent), at its sole expense, shall prepare and file or otherwise
furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Authority (or cause to
be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all other Tax
Returns relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Period or any Straddle Period that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date taking into account applicable extensions (for the avoidance of doubt,
such Tax Returns shall not include any Tax Return filed by a consolidated,
combined, unitary or affiliated group that includes the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand). Except to the extent otherwise
required under applicable Law, such Tax Returns described under this Section
7.02(b) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed
with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall provide
the Seller and its authorized representatives with a copy of such completed
Tax Returns and, if applicable, a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown
on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01,
together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20
Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the
filing of such Tax Return, and the Seller and its authorized representatives
shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement
prior to the filing of such Tax Return, provided that in the case of a Tax
Return that is due within 30 Business Days after the Closing Date (including
extensions thereof), the Purchaser shall provide a copy of such Tax Return
(along with supporting information and schedules) and statement and the Seller
shall



review and comment, as soon as practical before the filing due date. If the
Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree with respect to comments made by
the Seller, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit any such dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm which shall resolve any such dispute and the
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and
binding. If the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to resolve the dispute
at least three Business Days prior to the filing due date of the Tax Return at
issue, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Purchaser (or
Parent), subject to subsequent amendment as may be necessary to reflect the
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm and the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-half by the Seller and one-half
by the Purchaser.

(c)The Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all unpaid Taxes shown due and
payable (as agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser or as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm, as the case may be) on any Tax Returns prepared
and filed by the Seller pursuant to Section 7.02(a) with respect to the
Company and the Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid,
all unpaid Taxes shown due and payable (as agreed to by the Seller and the
Purchaser or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm, as the case may
be) on Tax Returns prepared and filed by the Purchaser (or Parent) pursuant to
Section 7.02(b) with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries (subject to
its right of indemnification from the Seller by the date set forth in Section
7.05 for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or, in the case of a Straddle Period,
allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 7.01(a) and Section 7.01(b), provided that the limitations of Section
7.01(c) shall not apply).

SECTION 7.03. Refunds. Any Tax refund or overpayment (including any interest
with respect thereto) relating to the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Period, including the portion of any such refund or overpayment
attributable to Taxes that are allocable to the pre-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period under Section 7.01(b), shall be the property of the Seller,
and if received by, or credited to, the Purchaser, an Affiliate of the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be paid over promptly to the
Seller (net of any income Taxes or other expenses incurred with respect to the
receipt or realization of such refund or overpayment). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to the Seller through a
reduction in Tax liability) for any Pre-Closing Period arising out of the
carryback of a loss, credit or other Tax attribute arising or incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary in any Post-Closing Period, which under applicable
Law is required to be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period, shall be the
property of the Purchaser and, if received by the Seller or an Affiliate of
the Seller, shall be paid over promptly to the Purchaser (net of any income
Taxes or other expenses incurred with respect to the receipt or realization of
such refund or overpayment). Unless otherwise required under applicable Law,
the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and Subsidiaries, not to
carry back any loss, credit or other Tax attribute arising or incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary in any Post-Closing Period to a Pre-Closing Period.



SECTION 7.04. Contests.

(a)After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing of any written notice of the commencement of any Action or proposed
assessment or Claim made against, or with respect to, the Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Company or any Subsidiary which (i) relates to a Pre-Closing
Period or a Straddle Period of the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) if
determined adversely to the taxpayer, could be grounds for indemnification
under this Article VII (a "Tax Action"); provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice will not affect the Purchaser's right to indemnification
under this Article VII except to the extent that such failure prejudices the
Seller.

(b)In the case of a Tax Action (other than a Tax Action that relates to a
Straddle Period with respect to a Stand-Alone Return), the Seller (and its
authorized representatives) shall have the right, at its expense, to control
the conduct of the Tax Action; the Purchaser (and its authorized
representatives) may also, at its expense, participate in, but not control,
any such Tax Action that is solely related to a Stand-Alone Return and, if the
Seller does not assume the defense of a Tax Action, the Purchaser (or its
authorized representative) may defend the same in such manner as it may deem
appropriate. In the case of a Tax Action that relates to a Straddle Period
with respect to a Stand-Alone Return, the Purchaser (and its authorized
representatives) shall have the right, at its expense, to control the Tax
Action; the Seller (and its authorized representatives) may also, at its
expense, participate in, but not control, any such Tax Action and, if the
Purchaser (or its authorized representative) does not assume the defense of
any such Tax Action, the Seller (and its authorized representatives) may
defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.04, with respect
to any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date, neither the
Purchaser nor the Seller shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle
any Tax Action which would adversely affect the other party for such taxable
period or a subsequent taxable period without the written consent of the other
party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees to
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the defense against or
compromise of any Tax Action.

SECTION 7.05. Time of Payment. Payment by the Seller of any amounts due under
this Article VII in respect of Taxes shall be made at least three Business
Days before the due date of the applicable Tax Return required to be filed by
Parent or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.02(b) for which the Seller is
responsible under Section 7.01(a) and Section 7.01(b) or within ten Business
Days following an agreement between the Seller and the Purchaser that an
indemnity amount is payable, a non-appealable final assessment of a Tax by a
Governmental Authority, or a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of
the Code.

SECTION 7.06. Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the



Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and information) in (a) filing any
Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (b) determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, or (c) participating in
or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof to the extent related to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, together with related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Governmental Authorities. The Seller and
the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees)
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of
any documents or information provided under this Section 7.06. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each of the Seller and the Purchaser
shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating
to Tax matters of the Company or any Subsidiary for any taxable period that
includes the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of
(i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to
extensions and (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
that relate solely to the Company and the Subsidiaries as such other party may
select (at such other party's expense). Any information obtained under this
Section 7.06 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or handling
a Tax Action.

SECTION 7.07. Conveyance Taxes. Any Conveyance Taxes imposed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by the
Purchaser and 50% by the Seller as Reimbursable Expenses. The parties will
cooperate to file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Conveyance Taxes and, if required by applicable Laws, will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
parties shall take any reasonable action that may be available to reduce or
eliminate any Conveyance Taxes.

SECTION 7.08. No Section 338 Election. The Purchaser and the Seller agree that
no election shall be made under Sections 338(g) or Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code with respect to the sale of the Shares under this Agreement, nor shall
any similar elections be made under applicable state or local Laws.

SECTION 7.09. Miscellaneous.

(a)The Seller and the Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by either of
them to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company
or any Subsidiary) under this Article VII, under other indemnity provisions of
this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or
covenants as adjustments to the Purchase Price or, if applicable, as capital
contributions from the Seller to the Company immediately prior to the Closing
for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof.



(b)All payments payable under any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between
the Seller and the Company or any Subsidiary for any taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date shall be calculated on a basis consistent with
past practice and shall be payable in full prior to the Closing. Any such Tax
sharing agreement or arrangement between the Seller and the Company or any
Subsidiary shall be terminated on or prior to the Closing.

(c)Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of the Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to this Article VII, and
the representations and warranties dealing with Tax matters, including those
contained in Section 3.19, shall terminate at the close of business on the
30th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof). If written notice of a claim has been given
to the Seller in good faith prior to the expiration of the relevant
obligation, representation or warranty described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then the relevant obligation, representation or warranty shall
survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

(d)Except as otherwise required under this Agreement, applicable Law, or in
settlement of a Tax audit or similar proceeding initiated by a Governmental
Authority, none of Parent, the Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall amend any Tax Return (or file an original Tax Return)
of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period.

(e)None of Parent, the Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall make, revoke or modify any Tax election of the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle Period
to the extent such action could reasonably be expected to increase the
Seller's liability (including under this Agreement).

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax
matters shall be governed solely by this Article VII; provided, however, that
Section 9.07 shall apply to this Article VII.

writing by any Governmental Authority or (ii) commenced by any Governmental

of Section 5.04(b);

(e)No Order. No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued,

the Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section

including Section 5.04 and Section 5.10.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a)The representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing

after the Closing Date. If written notice of a claim has been given by the
Purchaser to the Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in
good faith prior to the expiration of the applicable representations and
warranties, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as
to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.



(b)The representations and warranties of the Purchaser and Parent contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations shall survive indefinitely. If written notice of a claim has
been given by the Seller to Parent or the Purchaser in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and in good faith prior to the expiration of the
applicable representations and warranties, then the relevant representations
and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until such claim has been
finally resolved.

SECTION 9.02. Indemnification by the Seller. The Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser, Parent and their Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a "Purchaser Indemnified
Party") from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
(including attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses) actually suffered or
incurred by them (including any Action brought or otherwise initiated by any
of them) (hereinafter a "Loss") arising out of or resulting from:

(a)the breach as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date of any
representation or warranty made by the Seller contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by the Seller hereunder (it being agreed that for
purposes of determining the amount of any Loss with respect thereto, all such
representations and warranties of the Seller (other than the Seller
Fundamental Representations and Section 3.09(b) and with respect to the scope
of any disclosures required on the Disclosure Schedule) that are qualified as
to materiality shall be deemed to be not so qualified);

(b)the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreement; or

(c)Nova NextGen Solutions, whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing
Date; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be
liable pursuant to this Section 9.02(c) for any Liabilities or Losses
resulting from the ownership or operation of the Business by Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) after the Closing
(including any such Liabilities or Losses that (i) relate to or result from
any breach, default, violation or occurrence occurring after the Closing or
arising from an event, circumstance or condition occurring or existing after
the Closing that did not exist prior to the Closing, (ii) relate to a warranty
or indemnity for which the underlying circumstances relating to the warranty
or indemnity claim arose after the Closing, (iii) accrue or relate to the
operations of the Business after the Closing, or (iv) are required to be
performed after the Closing (and are not required to be performed on or prior
to the Closing Date and did not arise from an event, circumstance or condition
occurring or existing prior to the Closing)).

To the extent that the Seller's undertakings set forth in this Section 9.02
may be unenforceable, the Seller shall contribute the maximum amount (subject
to Section 9.04) that it is permitted to contribute under applicable Law to
the payment and satisfaction of all such Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.



SECTION 9.03. Indemnification by the Purchaser. The Purchaser and Parent,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates and stockholders and the Seller's and its Affiliates' respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a "Seller
Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from:

(a)the breach as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date of any
representation or warranty made by the Purchaser or Parent contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Purchaser or Parent hereunder
(it being agreed that for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss with
respect thereto, all such representations and warranties of the Purchaser or
Parent (other than the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) that are
qualified as to materiality shall be deemed to be not so qualified);

(b)the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser or Parent
contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreement; or

(c)any use by Parent, the Purchaser or their Affiliates (including the Company
and the Subsidiaries) of the Retained Names after the Closing, except for
claims that the Retained Names infringe the Intellectual Property of any third
party.

To the extent that the Purchaser's and Parent's undertakings set forth in this
Section 9.03 may be unenforceable, each of the Purchaser and Parent shall
contribute the maximum amount (subject to Section 9.04) that it is permitted
to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of all such
Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties.

SECTION 9.04. Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement: (a) an Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or
Section 9.03(a) (other than indemnification in respect of Seller Fundamental
Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations, respectively) unless
and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $7.5 million, whereupon the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for indemnification except to the
extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $7.5 million; (b) the
maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an
Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in
Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) (other than indemnification in respect of
Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations,
respectively) as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to 7.5% of the
Purchase Price; (c) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the
causes set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) for indemnification in
respect of Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, respectively, as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to
the Purchase Price; (d) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a), other than for
indemnifiable Losses in excess of $50,000 resulting from a single claim or
aggregate claims arising from the same facts, event or circumstances; and (e)
the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered



from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set
forth in Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, as the case may be, shall be an amount
equal to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
this Section 9.04 shall not apply to indemnification in respect of the
obligations of the parties pursuant to Section 5.10.

SECTION 9.05. Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims.

(a)An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter
that an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 30 days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises.

(b)If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, demand
or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it or which may give rise
to a claim for Loss under this Article IX, promptly, but in no event later
than 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure and shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or Liability that
it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article IX. If
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if there exists a
conflict of interest that the Indemnified Party's outside counsel shall have
advised the Indemnified Party would make it inappropriate for the same counsel
to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party so determines counsel is
required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in
any single Action. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the
right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, during
normal business hours and on reasonable advance notice, and at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such
claim or proceeding, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle any Third Party Claim (i) (A) for which



it obtains a full release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third
Party Claim and (B) which settlement does not impose upon any Indemnified
Party any injunctive or equitable relief (other than any immaterial injunctive
or equitable relief that is merely incidental to a primary obligation for
monetary damages), or (ii) to which settlement the Indemnified Party consents
in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If,
within 30 days after the receipt of the notice of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects to
undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Third Party Claim but
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder under any circumstances
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent (A) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such claim and (B) does
not impose upon the Indemnifying Party any injunctive or equitable relief
(other than any immaterial injunctive or equitable relief that is merely
incidental to a primary obligation for monetary damages). In such event, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, during normal business hours and
on reasonable advance notice, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such
witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's
possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 9.05 to the contrary, if a Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal Action or any Action seeking equitable or
remedial relief, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to jointly control
the defense thereof with the Indemnifying Party for so long as such Action is
continuing.

SECTION 9.06. Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except with respect to common law fraud (excluding any concept of
"constructive fraud") and except for the right to specifically enforce the
provisions of this Agreement as provided in Section 5.17 and Section 11.10,
following the Closing, the provisions of Section 5.10, Section 6.01, Article
VII and this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Seller
Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Loss and any
and all claims arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the sale
and purchase of the Company and Subsidiaries, and no Person will have any
other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates (and, with respect to the Seller, its stockholders) and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII or this Article IX or the
provisions in Section 5.10 or Section 6.01. The provisions of this Section
9.06, together with the provisions of Section 5.10 and Section 6.01 and the
limited remedies provided



in Article VII and this Article IX, were specifically bargained for between
Parent, the Purchaser and the Seller and were taken into account by Parent,
the Purchaser and the Seller in arriving at the Purchase Price. The Seller has
specifically relied upon the provisions of this Section 9.06, together with
the provisions of Section 5.10 and Section 6.01 and the limited remedies
provided in Article VII and this Article IX, in agreeing to the Purchase Price
and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set
forth herein.

SECTION 9.07. Certain Other Indemnification Matters.

(a)The Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder
(including Article VII) shall be reduced by any third party insurance proceeds
or other payments actually received by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction
of any such Losses and by any Tax benefits attributable to such Losses
actually realized in the year the Loss is incurred or sustained for federal
income Tax purposes or the immediate following taxable year by the Indemnified
Party. Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends
to seek indemnification hereunder shall use reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts to which it reasonably may be entitled under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses.

(b)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for any punitive
damages (other than punitive damages actually paid in respect of a Third Party
Claim) or loss of business reputation or any damages based on any type of
multiple relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement. Any
liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto (including by pursuing any insurance claims),
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Loss.

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION

SECTION 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a)by Parent if the Seller shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 10 Business Days after the
giving of written notice by Parent or the Purchaser specifying such breach;



(b)by the Seller if Parent or the Purchaser shall have breached any of its

Days after the giving of written notice by the Seller specifying such breach;

(c)by either the Seller or Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred by
September 30, 2015 (the "Initial End Date"); provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(c) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur or a condition to Closing to be satisfied on or prior to such
date; provided further that if, as of the Initial End Date, (i) any condition
set forth in Section 8.01(b), Section 8.01(c), Section 8.01(g), Section
8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) or Section 8.02(g) has not been waived or satisfied,
(ii) all of the other conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII shall
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
terms cannot be satisfied until at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the Initial End
Date), and (iii) either of the Seller, on the one hand, or Parent and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, notifies the other parties hereto in writing
that it desires to extend the Initial End Date in order to satisfy the
applicable condition or conditions set forth in Section 8.01(b), Section
8.01(c), Section 8.01(g), Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) or Section 8.02(g),
then the End Date shall be the earliest to occur of (x) December 14, 2015, (y)
the date upon which a Governmental Authority shall have entered an order
enjoining the parties from consummating the Closing and such order shall have
become final and non-appealable, and (z) in the case of any such extension to
satisfy a condition set forth in Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.02(c), the date
upon which the FCC or any State PUC shall have entered an order denying an
FCC/State PUC Filing associated with a non-waived Closing Approval under
Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.02(c) and such order shall have become final and
non-appealable;

(d)by either Parent or the Seller in the event that any Governmental Authority
shall have issued any Law or Governmental Order or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing, prohibiting or making illegal
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in
any such case, such Law or Governmental Order or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; or

(e)by the mutual written consent of the Seller and Parent.

SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto pursuant
to this Agreement except (a) as set forth in Section 5.03 and Article XI and
(b) that nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement prior to termination. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Non-Disclosure Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement for
any reason.

SECTION 11.03. Public Announcements. None of the parties hereto shall make, or
cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate
with any news media with respect thereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange rule or
regulation (based upon the advice of counsel), and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the parties hereto shall cooperate as to the timing and
contents of any such press release, public announcement or communication.

SECTION 11.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

SECTION 11.05. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreement and
the Non-Disclosure Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the sale and purchase of the Company and Subsidiaries
and the other subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the
Purchaser or Parent with respect to the sale and purchase of the Company and
Subsidiaries and the other subject matter hereof and thereof. The parties
shall not be bound by any stipulations, representations, agreements or
promises, oral or otherwise, not printed in written form in this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreement or the Non-



Disclosure Agreement. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of the sale and purchase
of the Company and Subsidiaries exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto
expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, each of the
parties hereby acknowledges that this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's length negotiations;
all parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any
special relationship with another party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's length
transaction. The sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set
forth herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or
related to the sale and purchase of the Company and Subsidiaries shall be
those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as
such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to
the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereby agree that
neither party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action in, whether in
contract or in tort, for any statements, communications, disclosures, failures
to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreement or any certificate, instrument or document delivered
hereunder.

SECTION 11.06. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and Parent
(which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller
or Parent, as applicable) and any such assignment or attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to one or more Affiliates of Parent
without the consent of the Seller, provided that any such assignment by the
Purchaser shall not relieve the Purchaser of any liability or obligation
hereunder.

SECTION 11.07. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
(a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller and
Parent or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. Waiver. The Seller, on the one hand, and Parent and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party contained herein, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any certificate delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other party or conditions to such party's obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of the Seller, Parent or the
Purchaser to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver
of any of such rights.



SECTION 11.09. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of
Article IX relating to indemnified parties and pursuant to Section 5.11 and
Section 11.15, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person, including any union or any employee or former employee
of the Seller, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under
or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that they would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which the parties hereto may be entitled, at Law or in equity,
they shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree
of specific performance and to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief, without any requirement to post or provide any bond or
other security in connection therewith, to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.11. Governing Law. THE INTERNAL LAW (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS)
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS OR
CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE
OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED
