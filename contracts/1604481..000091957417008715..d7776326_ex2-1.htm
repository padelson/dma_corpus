-14-  

  


 

  

(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver
of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions; or (ii) at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as the Parties may mutually agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing actually takes place and is completed (including the Contribution in
Kind and issuance of the Merger Consideration to the Exchange Agent in the

Shareholders and the holders of Company RSUs) is referred to as the " _Closing
Date_ ". At the Closing, and immediately following the filing of the Articles
of Merger as contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_ , the Parties shall duly execute
the Notarial Deed before the Belgian notary public.

  

(c) _Effective Time._ At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause
to be filed articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the
Registrar or Deputy Registrar of Corporations of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands and make all other filings or recordings required by the MIBCA in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Registrar or Deputy Registrar
of Corporations of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (or at such later time
as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and specified in the Articles of
Merger in accordance with the MIBCA) (the time the Merger becomes effective,
the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

(d) _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the MIBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and purposes of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, claims,
obligations, liabilities, restrictions, duties and penalties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, claims, obligations, liabilities,
restrictions, duties and penalties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(e) _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger, (i) the articles of incorporation of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but as amended as set forth on
_Exhibit A_ hereto, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with such articles of
incorporation and applicable Law, and (ii) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, except the references to Merger Sub\'s name shall be
replaced by references to"Euronav MI II Inc.", until thereafter amended in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and applicable Law.

  

(f) _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation._ The directors and
officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial directors
and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office

ARTICLE III

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER

  

SECTION 3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, any Company Common Shareholder or the holder of any shares of common
stock of Merger Sub:

  

(a) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Specified Company Shares) shall be
canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, in the following manner: first, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Specified Company Shares) shall be automatically converted
into one (1) Surviving Corporation Share and to effect such conversion the
Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, solely in the name
and on behalf of and for the account and benefit of the former Company Common
Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares), a number of
Surviving Corporation Shares equal to the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (reduced by
the number of Specified Company Shares), and second, each such Surviving
Corporation Share shall be automatically exchanged for the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section 3.3_. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in the manner
contemplated by _Section 3.3_ ;

  

(b) each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by (i) the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries,
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one Surviving
Corporation Share; and

  

(d) notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Shares shall have changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
dividend or distribution, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, stock consolidation, combination, exchange
of shares or other similar change or event then, the Merger Consideration and
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend or distribution, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock consolidation,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar change or event.

  

SECTION 3.2. _Effect on Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Note._

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of a Company Stock Option, each then outstanding
Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall
terminate and be canceled in exchange for the

  

 

-16-  

  


 

  

right of the holder to be paid by the Surviving Corporation, immediately after
the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) calendar days
following the Effective Time), the Option Consideration payable in respect of
such Company Stock Option, less any applicable withholding Taxes; _provided,
however,_ that if the exercise price applicable to shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Transaction Value Per Share, such Company Stock Option shall terminate and be
canceled in exchange for no consideration. The Option Consideration paid or
payable in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Stock Options. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Stock Options that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of Company RSUs, each then outstanding Company RSU
shall become fully vested (including with respect to dividends and other
distributions) in accordance with its terms and shall terminate and be
canceled and Surviving Corporation Shares equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Company RSU shall be issued to the
Exchange Agent (solely in the name and on behalf of for the account and
benefit of the former Company RSU holder), and such Surviving Corporation
Shares shall be automatically exchanged for the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes, as set forth in
_Section 3.3(a)_. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company RSU shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, in
accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ , the Per Share Merger Consideration for the
number of shares of Company Common Stock which were issuable to such holder
under such Company RSU.

  

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions
of _Section 3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_ , including obtaining the requisite
board or committee consents and taking all actions necessary or appropriate
under the Company Incentive Plan and/or applicable award agreements.

  

(d) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company has entered into a letter
agreement with certain Affiliates of BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC
(collectively, " _BlueMountain_ ") providing that (i) the repayment premium
that would otherwise be payable upon a prepayment of the notes issued under
that certain Note and Guarantee Agreement, originally dated as of March 28,
2014, by and among the Company, Gener8 Maritime Subsidiary V Inc. (formerly
known as VLCC Acquisition I Corporation) and BlueMountain (as the purchasers
of notes thereunder) (the " _Note and Guarantee Agreement_ ") shall be reduced
to a premium equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the notes prepaid to
the holders, and (ii) the principal outstanding amount and all accrued
interest and such repayment penalty on the Note and Guarantee Agreement shall
be repaid in full to BlueMountain in cash on or prior to the Closing Date of
the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Note and Guarantee Agreement
(as modified by such letter agreement). From and after the date hereof until
the Closing Date, the Company agrees to give proper notices to elect to pay
any interest payments falling due under the Note and Guarantee Agreement in
cash (not in kind); _provided, however,_ that in the event that the Company
Board reasonably concludes that making any such cash interest payment is
reasonably likely to leave the Company without adequate operating liquidity or
is otherwise

  

 

-17-  

  


 

  

not in the best interest of the Company, then the Company Board may determine
that the Company instead elect to make a payment-in-kind of interest otherwise
due and payable.

  

SECTION 3.3. _Contribution in Kind to Parent and Delivery of Consideration._

  

(a) _Contribution in Kind._ The appointment of the Exchange Agent to act as
agent for the Merger and to, among other things, act as agent in the name and
on behalf of and for the account and benefit of the Company Common
Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) for the
purpose of giving effect to the Contribution in Kind contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_ and delivering the Per Share Merger Consideration to the Company
Common Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) and
holders of Company RSUs pursuant to the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting. Parent and the Company shall appoint the Exchange Agent as promptly
as practicable after such approval is obtained (but in no event later than the
Effective Time). The exchange agent agreement to be entered into with the
Exchange Agent, as directed by the terms of the Agreement and authorized by
the approval of the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting, shall authorize the Exchange Agent to act in the name and on behalf
of and for the account and benefit of the Company Common Shareholders (other
than the holders of Specified Company Shares) and the holders of Company RSUs
to (i) contribute Surviving Corporation Shares to Parent and (ii) accept in
their name and on their behalf, in return for such contribution, the Merger
Consideration. As soon as possible on the Closing Date following the Effective
Time, and pursuant to the provisions of the BCC, the Exchange Agent (acting as
an exchange agent and solely in the name and on behalf of and for the account
and benefit of the Company Common Shareholders (other than the holders of
Specified Company Shares) and the holders of Company RSUs), shall contribute
solely in the name and on behalf of and for the account and benefit of the
Company Common Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company
Shares) and the holders of Company RSUs), all of the issued and outstanding
Surviving Corporation Shares that were issued to the Exchange Agent pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_ to Parent as a Contribution in Kind
and, in consideration of this Contribution in Kind, Parent shall issue and
deliver to the Exchange Agent (solely in the name and on behalf of and for the
account and benefit of the Company Common Shareholders (other than the holders
of Specified Company Shares) and the holders of Company RSUs), the Merger
Consideration (such Parent Shares constituting the Merger Consideration
received by the Exchange Agent and other cash or assets received by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to the terms hereof for payment to Company Common
Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) and holders
of Company RSUs are referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent shall provide that, to the
extent that there is any shareholders meeting of Parent with a record date
occurring during the period of time that the Exchange Agent holds any
undistributed Parent Shares in the Exchange Fund (" _Undistributed Parent
Shares_ "), the Exchange Agent will not vote any of such Undistributed Parent
Shares on any matter presented for a vote at such Parent shareholders meeting
or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared or made with respect to Parent Shares with a record
date for such dividend or distribution after the Closing Date, it shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent with respect to all Undistributed Parent
Shares on such record date (and such dividends or distributions shall be added
to the Exchange Fund and shall be paid over by the Exchange Agent to the
Company Common Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified

  

 

-18-  

  


 

  

Company Shares) to which the corresponding Parent Shares receiving such
dividends or distributions are distributed by the Exchange Agent upon such
Company Common Shareholders\' proper delivery pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ of
a letter of transmittal and Certificate or Book-Entry Shares).

  

(b) Company Common Stock.

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, the Exchange
Agent shall mail or otherwise deliver to each Company Common Shareholder whose
Company Common Stock was converted into Surviving Corporation Shares and who
has the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration hereunder: (A) a
letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify
that, in respect of any Certificate, risk of loss and title shall pass only
upon receipt thereof (or of an affidavit in accordance with _Section 3.5_ ) by
the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and shall be in such form
and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify, (B) any notice required pursuant to the MIBCA, and (C)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, held by such Company Common
Shareholder. In the event a Company Common Shareholder does not deliver to the
Exchange Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and does
not deliver the Certificate(s) or surrender the Book-Entry Shares held by such
Company Common Shareholder, such Person shall not be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration relating to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share unless and until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares (or an affidavit
in accordance with _Section 3.5_ ), as applicable, to the Exchange Agent.
Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the
Exchange Agent\'s customary procedures with respect to securities represented
by book entry. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_ ,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and this _Section
3.3._

  

(ii) Upon the Exchange Agent\'s receipt of a duly executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal and the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the
Book-Entry Shares held by any Company Common Shareholder, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver, in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_ , to such Company Common
Shareholder an aggregate number of such Parent Shares equal to the sum of such
Company Common Shareholder\'s Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock properly surrendered by such Company Common Shareholder
pursuant hereto.

  

(iii) The Per Share Merger Consideration paid or payable and issued or
issuable upon the surrender of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ shall be paid or payable and issued or issuable in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock.

  

(c) Transfer Books Closed. From and after the Effective Time, the transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on

  

 

-19-  

  


 

  

the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock
that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(d) _Company RSUs._ In the case of Company RSUs, the holder of any such
Company RSUs shall receive in exchange therefor the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration into which such Company RSUs have been converted pursuant
to _Section 3.2(b)_ , to be paid by the Exchange Agent to such holder of
Company RSUs on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. The Per
Share Merger Consideration paid or payable in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company RSUs. Immediately after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company RSUs that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(e) _No Fractional Shares._ No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof, any Person who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating for
each particular Certificate or Book-Entry Share all fractional shares of
Parent Shares to be received by such Person) shall receive from the Exchange
Agent an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Parent VWAP. Following
the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall sell at then-prevailing prices on
the NYSE such number of Parent Shares constituting a portion of the Exchange
Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all Company
Common Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) and
holders of Company RSUs, with the cash proceeds of such sales to be used by
the Exchange Agent to fund the foregoing payments in lieu of fractional shares
(and if the proceeds of such share sales by the Exchange Agent are
insufficient for such purpose, then Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Exchange Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the deficiency required
to make all such payments in lieu of fractional shares). The Parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of delivering
fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate
and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the delivery of
fractional Parent Shares.

  

(f) _Undistributed Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the Company Common Shareholders (other than the
holders of Specified Company Shares) or the holders of any outstanding Company
Stock Options or Company RSUs, for six (6) months after the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent, and any such Person, to the extent such Person has not
theretofore complied with this _Section 3.3_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, the Per Share Merger
Consideration or the Option Consideration, as the case may be, to which such
Person is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Any such portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by the Company Common Shareholders (other
than the holders of Specified Company Shares) or the holders of any
outstanding Company Stock Options or Company RSUs for five (5) years after the
Closing Date (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

 

-20-  

  


 

  

(g) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any
Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any
cash amounts, properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any such holders, their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto or any other Person.

  

(h) _Dispute Resolution._ Prior to the Closing Date, any disputes regarding
this _Section 3.3_ shall be addressed and resolved jointly by the Company and
Parent, and any amendments to or waivers of any provision of this _Section
3.3_ shall be made jointly by the Company and Parent. After the Closing, any
such disputes shall be addressed and resolved by the Parent Board, and any
amendments to or waivers of this _Section 3.3_ shall be made in the sole
discretion of the Parent Board.

  

SECTION 3.4. _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law
and shall timely pay such withholding amount to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts, to the extent timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

SECTION 3.5. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Company Common Shareholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article III._

  

SECTION 3.6. _Parent Capital Increase._ Parent shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions as may be necessary for Parent to issue the Parent Shares
required to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , _Section 3.2(b)_ and
_Section 3.3(a),_ including (a) the due preparation, drafting, execution and
filing (as the case may be) of the Parent Special Board Report, the Notarial
Deed and any other instruments of issuance, and (b) to cause the delivery of
the Parent Audit Report (a copy of which shall be made available to the
Company Board as promptly as possible after the

  

 

-21-  

  


 

  

same is delivered to Parent) confirming that the value of the Surviving
Corporation Shares contributed to Parent pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ amounts
to at least the number and (fractional) value and, as the case may be, the
issue premium of Parent Shares to be exchanged therefor. As promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to
January 31, 2018, Parent shall provide to the Company drafts of the Parent
Special Board Report and Notarial Deed.

  

ARTICLE IV

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

Except (i) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, or (ii) as disclosed
in Company SEC Documents filed or furnished and made publicly available on or
after January 1, 2017 through the date of this Agreement to the extent such
disclosure on its face appears to constitute information that would reasonably
be deemed a qualification or exception to the following representations and
warranties (other than any forward looking disclosures set forth in any risk
factor section, any disclosures in any section related to forward looking
statements included in any such reports, schedules, forms or documents and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent that such statements are
primarily cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

SECTION 4.1. _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power._ The Company is

(where applicable) or has equivalent status, in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties or assets owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
or to have equivalent status would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies
of the articles of incorporation, bylaws and any other governing documents of
the Company (the " _Company Charter Documents_ ") as currently in effect as of
the date hereof.

  

SECTION 4.2. _Authorization._

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions are within the
Company\'s corporate powers and, except for the Company Shareholders Approval,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of
any of the Company\'s capital stock required to complete the Transactions,
including the Merger (the " _Company Shareholders Approval_ "). This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
from time to time in effect affecting generally the enforcement of creditors\'
rights

  

 

-22-  

  


 

  

or remedies; and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law) ( _clauses
(i)_ and ( _ii_ ) collectively, the " _Equitable Exceptions_").

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Transaction Committee has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company\'s shareholders,
(ii) declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, and (iii)
recommended to the Company Board that this Agreement and the Transactions be
approved by the Company Board and submitted to the Company Shareholders
Meeting for approval by the shareholders of the Company (such recommendation,
which as of the date of this Agreement has not been rescinded, modified or
amended in any respect, the " _Transaction Committee Recommendation_ "). At a
meeting duly called and held, the Company Board has (A) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company\'s shareholders, (B) approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, (C) recommended that this
Agreement and the Transactions be submitted to the Company Shareholders
Meeting for approval by the shareholders of the Company, and (D) adopted the
recommendation by the Transaction Committee for approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Transaction by the shareholders of the Company (such
recommendation, which as of the date of this Agreement has not been rescinded,
modified or amended in any respect, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

  

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5.2_ ( _b_ ), the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions
require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than (i) the filing and recordation of appropriate merger or
other documents as required by the MIBCA and by relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business (including the

Third Party to whom the Company is permitted to provide information in
accordance with _Section 6_ _.4_ _(b )(i)_ ), or (v) grant any waiver,
amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement or any
Takeover Statute or similar provision contained in the Company Charter

Third Parties\' standstill obligations and granting a limited waiver if
requested solely to enable such Third Parties to make an Acquisition Proposal
to the Company Board. The Company shall (and the Company shall (1) cause its
Subsidiaries to and (2) instruct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives and any of its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to) cease

Third Party and its Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior
to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or efforts to
obtain an Acquisition Proposal, and shall also request such Third Party to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof.

  

(b) _Exceptions_.

  

(i) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the Company
Shareholders Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof (that has not
been withdrawn) that did not result from a breach or violation of the
provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ and, prior to taking any action described in
_clauses (A)_ and ( _B_ ) below, (1) the Transaction Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisors
of nationally recognized reputation, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (2) the
Company shall have complied with _Section 6.4(c)_ , then the Company may, in
response to such Acquisition Proposal, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and its Representatives or financing sources with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) thereafter furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives or financing sources non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a

hours) provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third
Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all written materials provided or
made available to such Third Party (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
after the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.

  

(ii) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the Company
Shareholders Approval, the Transaction Committee or the Company Board may,
following receipt of or on account of a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such Superior Proposal, if such
Superior Proposal did not result from a breach or violation of the provisions
of _Section 6.4(a),_ and the Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation that, in
light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Transaction Committee or
the Company Board, as applicable, to take such action is

  

 

-58-  

  


 

  

reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that the
Transaction Committee and the Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal unless
(A) the Transaction Committee promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least
five (5) Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change (the "
_Notice Period_" ) ,of the intention of the Transaction Committee or the
Company Board, as applicable, to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has
received an Acquisition Proposal that the Transaction Committee or the Company
Board, as applicable, has determined to be a Superior Proposal and that the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change; (B) the Transaction Committee attaches to such
notice the proposed transaction agreements and the identity of the Third Party
making such Superior Proposal; (C) during the Notice Period, if requested
(orally or in writing) by Parent, the Transaction Committee has engaged, and
has directed its Representatives to engage, in negotiations with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (D) following the Notice Period, the Transaction Committee or
the Company Board, as applicable, shall have considered in good faith any
proposed amendments to this Agreement and determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent, that such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided, however,_ that, with
respect to any applicable Superior Proposal, any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment to a term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notice by the Transaction Committee and a new
Notice Period (except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to seventy-two
(72) hours, or if there are less than seventy-two (72) hours prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, as much notice as is reasonably practicable, and
in no event shall the new Notice Periods exceed nine (9) days in the
aggregate), and no such Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
Superior Proposal may be made during any Notice Period.

  

(iii) Prior to (but not at any time from or after) obtaining the Company
Shareholders Approval, the Transaction Committee or the Company Board may, if
there has been an Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Intervening Event if the Transaction Committee or the
Company Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, to take such action
is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s shareholders under applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that the
Transaction Committee and the Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with an Intervening Event unless
(A) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least three (3)
Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change of the intention
of the Transaction Committee or Company Board, as applicable, to take such
action with respect to such Intervening Event, which notice shall include the
material facts underlying the Transaction Committee\'s or the Company Board\'s
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and state the reasons
that the Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, intends to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, (B) during such
three (3)-

  

 

-59-  

  


 

  

Business Day period, if requested (orally or in writing) by Parent, the
Company has engaged, and has directed its Representatives to engage, in
negotiations with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to amend this Agreement in such a manner that an Adverse
Recommendation Change is no longer warranted as a result of the Intervening
Event, and (C) following such three (3)-Business Day period, the Transaction
Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, shall have considered in good
faith any proposed amendments to this Agreement and determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, taking into account any changes to this
Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent, that the failure of the
Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as applicable, to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such Intervening Event is reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable Law; _provided,_ that the Company shall not be
required to negotiate with Parent in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change that the Company Board intends to effect in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company has already negotiated with Parent in accordance with
this _Section 6.4_ ( _b_ )( _iii_ ) in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Transaction Committee or the Company Board, as
applicable, in response to the same Intervening Event.

  

(iv) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Transaction
Committee or the Company Board from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the
1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, or from (A) making legally
required disclosures; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may
only be made in a manner consistent with this _Section 6.4_ , or (B) granting
any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality
agreement or any Takeover Statute or similar provision contained in the
Company Charter Documents.

  

(c) _Required Notices._ The Company and the Company Board shall not take any
of the actions referred to in _Section 6.4(b)_ unless the Company shall have
first complied with the applicable requirements of this _Section 6.4(c)_. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt by the Company (or, if received by any of the Company\'s
Representatives, after the Company is informed by such Representative) of any
Acquisition Proposal or of any inquiries or other communication regarding the
making of an Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions
thereof and providing a copy, if applicable, of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, and the identity of the
Person making (or inquiry or communications about) such Acquisition Proposal
and its proposed financing sources, if any, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt basis (but in any event no later than 24 hours) as to the
status (including changes or proposed changes to the material terms) of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, personnel, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has informed
the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly of the Company\'s
intention to take the actions set forth in _clauses (A)_ or ( _B_ ) of
_Section 6.4(b)(i)_. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Third Party subsequent to

Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.4_.

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal._ For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ that, for the purposes of this definition, references to"15%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with
references to"50%") that (i) was not solicited by the Company or any of its
Representatives from and after November 20, 2017, (ii) is not subject to any
additional financing conditions that are not already contemplated by this
Agreement and for which financing has been fully committed or is on hand or
the Company Board or the Transaction Committee, as applicable, determines in
good faith after considering the advice of its financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation is reasonably probable to be fully financed, and (iii)
the Company Board or the Transaction Committee, as applicable, has determined
in good faith, after considering the advice of its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and taking into
consideration all of the applicable terms, conditions, impacts and all legal,
financial, regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board or the Transaction Committee, as applicable,
deems in good faith to be relevant, including, to the extent the Company Board
or the Transaction Committee, as applicable, deems relevant, the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, financing, regulatory approvals,
shareholder litigation, termination fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
the expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation, would result in a
transaction more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company\'s
shareholders than the Transactions provided hereunder (after taking into

-62-  

  


 

  

whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time to the
fullest extent permitted by the MIBCA or any other applicable Law or provided
under the Company Charter Documents in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under applicable Law or under the Company Charter Documents in effect
on the date hereof. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Action.

  

(b) For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,

any such Subsidiary shall not continue in existence) regarding exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in effect as of the date hereof or
in any agreement, a complete copy of which agreement has been provided by the
Company to Parent prior to the date hereof, to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, in each case in effect immediately prior to the

Effective Time, a prepaid"tail policy" for a period of no more than six (6)

such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, succeed to or
assume the applicable obligations of such party set forth in this _Section
7.1._

addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company Group Charter
Documents (or successor company documents), under the MIBCA or any other

Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Transaction Committee and the
Company Board that the Company\'s shareholders give the Company Shareholders

shall not make or file any amendment, supplement or change to the Proxy
Statement without the written consent of Parent, except in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change or as otherwise required by applicable Law;
_provided,_ that, if, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting,
any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

any Adverse Recommendation Change. The Company shall not adjourn or postpone
the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided,_ that the Company shall have the right to adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting if: (i) after consultation with Parent, for a
single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days from the date on which the

sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company

Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting; or (iii) after consultation with Parent, the
failure to adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting would
reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the
distribution of any required amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to
be timely provided to the Company\'s shareholders (the period that the Company
Shareholders Meeting is adjourned or postponed, the " _Adjournment Period_ ").

in _Section 9.2(d_ ) or _Section 9.3(d_ ).

  

SECTION 8.7. _Transfer Taxes._ The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation,

SECTION 8.8. _Waiver of Conflicts._ Recognizing that Kramer Levin Naftalis and
Frankel LLP (" _Kramer Levin_ ") has acted as legal counsel to the Company,
its Subsidiaries, certain of the direct and indirect holders of Company Common
Stock and certain of their respective Affiliates prior to date hereof, and
that Kramer Levin intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the direct and
indirect holders of Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates
(which will no longer include the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the
Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Kramer Levin representing any direct or indirect holders of the Company Common
Stock or their Affiliates after the Effective Time as such representation may
relate to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between direct and
indirect holders of Company Common Stock, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Kramer Levin, on the other
hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of Company
Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Kramer Levin relating to such engagement
from and after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, (a) the direct and indirect
holders of Company Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of Kramer Levin in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the direct and indirect holders of Company Common
Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights, and (c) Kramer Levin shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kramer
Levin and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. This _Section
_8.8 will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 8.8_ may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of Kramer Levin.

  

SECTION 8.9. _Tax Matters._ Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts (i) to cause the Merger, including the receipt of
Parent Shares by Company Common Shareholders, to qualify as a"reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code with respect to which Parent
and the Company will each be a"party to the reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(b) of the Code and (ii) not to, and not permit or cause any of
its respective Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action
reasonably likely to cause the

  

 

-71-  

  


 

  

Merger, including the receipt of Parent Shares by Company Common Shareholders,
to fail to qualify as a"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
9.1, Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such Party\'s breach of any provision of this
Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the

or _Section 8.5._

  

ARTICLE X

such Material Parent Breach cannot be or, to the extent curable by Parent or
Merger Sub, has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the End Date and (2)

(d_ ) if the Company is then in breach of any of its covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure of any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.3(a_ ) or _Section 9.3(d_ ); and

  

(e) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement (other than its
covenants and obligations under _Section 6.4_ ), or (ii) any representation or

to result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.3(a_ ) or
_Section 9.3(d_ ) (such circumstance, a " _Material Company Breach_ "), __ and
such Material Company Breach cannot be or, to the extent curable by the
Company, has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the End Date and (2) twenty
(20) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach or
failure; _provided_ , that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of
being cured by the Company by the End Date, such twenty (20) day period shall
be extended until the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the End Date solely
to the extent during such period the Company is using its reasonable best
efforts to cure such breach or failure to perform; _provided, further,_ that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_clause (e_ ) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of their
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result
in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.2(a_ ) or
_Section 9.2(d_ ).

  

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1_
(other than pursuant to _Section 10.1(a_ )) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Party.

  

SECTION 10.2. _Effect of Termination._ Subject to _Section 11.4(d_ ), if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect without liability of any Party (or any

of such Party) to the other Party; _provided_ that, if such termination shall

other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Closing Date.

  

SECTION 11.3. _Amendments and Waivers._

  

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,

any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law.

  

SECTION 11.4. _Expenses._

Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such termination and, in the case
of a termination by the Company, at the time of such termination. " _Company

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated (A)(1) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 10.1(b)(ii_ ) and prior to the taking of a vote to adopt this

Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount due to Parent on or prior
to the date such amounts are due pursuant to this _Section 11.4,_ it shall
also pay any costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action
or proceeding to enforce the obligations to pay the Company Termination Fee
that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such amounts
were originally due hereunder, from the date such fee, cost or expense was
required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms herein under circumstances where the
Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section
11.4_ and such Company Termination Fee is received in full, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in
equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain

indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. In no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more

SECTION 11.5. _Exhibits; Disclosure Letters._ All exhibits annexed hereto are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. References to this Agreement shall include the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter. The Parties agree that any item or
reference in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable
representations and warranties (or applicable covenants) that are contained in
the corresponding Sections or subsections of this Agreement and any other
representations and warranties that are contained in this Agreement to which
the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face. The
mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable or establish any
standard of materiality to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 11.6. _Waiver._ Subject to _Section 11.3_ hereof, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholders Meeting,
Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of the Company,
or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance
with any of the agreements or covenants of the Company or with any conditions
to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of Parent (on behalf of
itself and Merger Sub) to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if
such waiver is set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
Parent by its duly authorized officer. Subject to _Section 11.3_ hereof, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Shareholders Meeting, the Company may (a) extend the time for the performance
of

  

 

-79-  

  


 

  

any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, or
(b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance
with any of the agreements or covenants of Parent or Merger Sub or with any
conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of the Company to
any such extension or waiver will be valid only if such waiver is set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Company by its duly
authorized officer. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances will not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances, and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

  

SECTION 11.7. _Governing Law._ This Agreement will be deemed to be made in and
in all respects will be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York,
except (a) to the extent that the Law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
or of the Kingdom of Belgium are mandatorily applicable to the Transactions,
and (b) all matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Company shall be
subject to the Laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

  

SECTION 11.8. _Jurisdiction._ EACH OF THE PARTIES CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN MANHATTAN IN NEW YORK CITY OR IN THE
FEDERAL SOUTHERN DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND ANY APPELLATE COURT
THEREFROM LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL
ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS.
EACH OF THE PARTIES ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESPECTIVE

7.1_ and _Section 11.15_ (which provisions are intended to be for the benefit
of the Persons referred to therein, and may be enforced by any such Person),
the Parties hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties.

  

SECTION 11.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred in connection therewith. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal
court located in the State of New York or any New York state court, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
and the Parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting

question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed

will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.15. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer
any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except (i) as provided in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 and (ii) the
Company on behalf of the Company\'s shareholders to pursue damages (including

hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub.

  

(b) No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other Party,
except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement after the Closing Date to any Affiliate of
Parent; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub
of any obligations under this Agreement; provided, further, that no assignment
or purported assignment of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub shall be
valid if and to the extent such assignment causes the Merger to fail to
qualify as a"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Any purported assignment without such
prior written consents shall be void.

  

SECTION 11.16. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality

the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

SECTION 11.17. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and unless each
Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other

to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Gener8 Maritime,
Inc., Euronav MI Inc., and Euronav NV, dated December 20, 2017 (the"Merger
Agreement"). All capitalized terms used in this Article K, unless otherwise
defined herein, shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Merger
Agreement. Reference is made to the Company Shareholders Meeting convened on
[0], 2018 at which the Company Common Shareholders approved the Merger and
ratified the appointment of an Exchange Agent to act as agent for the Merger
and to, among other things, act as agent solely in the name and on behalf of
and for the account and benefit of the former Company Common Shareholders
(other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) for purposes of giving
effect to the Contribution in Kind by (i) contributing the Surviving
Corporation Shares to Parent in the name and on behalf of and for the account

name and on their behalf, in return for such contribution, the Merger
Consideration and (iii) performing all other actions contemplated by Article

name and on behalf of and for the account and benefit of the Company Common
Shareholders (other than the holders of Specified Company Shares) and the
holders of Company RSUs and pursuant to the provisions of the Belgian
Companies Code (but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Belgian Companies Code
shall only apply for purposes of the Contribution in Kind), to perform any and
all obligations of the Exchange Agent as set forth in the Merger Agreement
