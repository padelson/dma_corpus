 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 8, 2012 (this " **
_Agreement_** "), is by and among KAYAK Software Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), priceline.com Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Parent_** "), and Produce Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** ,"
with the Company and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter referred to,
together, as the " ** _Constituent Corporations_** ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub
(the " ** _Merger_** "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that, for federal income tax purposes, the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " ** _Code_** "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME_

 



 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and
into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "),
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " ** _DGCL_** ").

 



 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the first (1st) business day (the " **
_Closing Date_** ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the

      
 

 



 

fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **
_business day_** " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time)
other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York.

 



 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " ** _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " **
_Effective Time_** "). If the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
requires any changes in the Delaware Certificate of Merger as a condition to
filing or issuing a certificate that the Merger is effective, the parties
shall execute any necessary revisions incorporating such changes; _provided_ ,
such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material
change(s) in the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS 
OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

 



 

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " **
_Charter_** "), until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that Article 1 of the Charter shall be amended to read
in its entirety as follows: "The name of the Corporation is KAYAK Software
Corporation."

 



 

2.2. _The By-Laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " **
_By-Laws_** "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

 



 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the
By-Laws.

 



   

     
 

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 



 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Class A common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the " ** _Class A Common Stock_**"), and each share of
Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " ** _Class B Common
Stock_**"), of the Company (collectively, the " ** _Shares_** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of
third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders that have
perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" ** _Dissenting Stockholders_** ") ((i) and (ii),
collectively, the " ** _Excluded Shares_** ")) shall be converted into the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in this
Article IV, the following consideration:

 



 

(i) Subject to Section 4.2, each Share that is a Cash Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash (the " ** _Per Share_**
_**Cash Consideration**_ ").

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section 4.2, each Share that is a Stock Election Share shall
be converted into a portion of a share (the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** ") of
common stock, par value $0.008 per share, of Parent (the " ** _Parent Common
Stock_** ") equal to the quotient (the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** ") determined
by _dividing_ (A) $40.00 by (B) the Parent Trading Price (the " ** _Per Share
Stock Consideration_** "); provided that (x) if the number determined by
dividing $40.00 by the Parent Trading Price is less than or equal to 0.05728,
then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.05728, and (y) if the number determined by
dividing $40.00 by the Parent Trading Price is greater than or equal to
0.07001, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.07001.

 



 

(iii) Each Share that is a No Election Share shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Per Share Stock
Consideration, as determined pursuant to Section 4.2.

 



 

At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " **
_Certificate_** ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) and any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held in book-
entry form (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** ") shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. As used
herein, (x) the

 



      
 

 



 

term " ** _Per Share Merger Consideration_** " means, with respect to any
Share, either the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Per Share Stock
Consideration, as applicable, and (y) the term " ** _Parent Trading Price_** "
means the thirty (30) day aggregate volume-weighted average per share price,
rounded to two decimal points, of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market (" ** _NASDAQ_** ") (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ )
for the period of the thirty (30) consecutive trading days ending on the
second-to-last full trading day prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.3(h).

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the
Parent Common Stock, the Class A Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 4.1(d) shall be construed to permit
Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to their respective
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

4.2. _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
in such form as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (the " **
_Election Form_** ") shall be (i) filed by Parent as an exhibit to the Form
S-4, and (ii) mailed by the Company, together with the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, to each holder of record of Shares as of the record date
for the Stockholders Meeting (the " ** _Record Date_** ").

 



 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) of Shares to
specify (A) the number of such holders Shares with respect to which such
holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (" ** _Stock
Election Shares_** "), (B) the number of such holders Shares with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (" **
_Cash Election Shares_** ") or (C) that such holder makes no election with
respect to such holders Shares (" ** _No Election Shares_** "). Any Shares
with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election

 



      
 

 



 

Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is five (5)
business days preceding the Closing Date (the " ** _Election Deadline_** ")
shall be deemed to be No Election Shares.

 



 

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by any Person that becomes a holder (or
beneficial owner) of Shares during the period between the Record Date and the
Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information with respect to such holder reasonably necessary for it to perform
as specified herein.

 



 

(d) Any election contemplated in Section 4.2(b) shall be considered to have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more
Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
Certificates) representing all Shares covered by such Election Form, together
with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any
Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election
Form only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form is
submitted and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the Election
Deadline, the Shares represented by such revoked Election Form shall be deemed
No Election Shares, and Parent shall cause the Certificates to be promptly
returned without charge to the holder submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from such holder. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent or Parent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (which, for this purpose,
shall be deemed to include Shares that are owned by Dissenting Stockholders)
shall equal (i) 12,725,035 Shares (which constitute 33% of the total number of
Shares outstanding as of October 31, 2012), _plus_ (ii) 33% of the number of
Shares that are issued from and after October 31, 2012 and prior to the
Effective Time, pursuant to the exercise or vesting of Company Options or
Company RSUs outstanding as of the date hereof (clauses (i) and (ii),
together, the " ** _Target Cash Conversion Number_** ").

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later
than five (5) days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent

 



 



      
 

 



 

to effect the allocation among the holders of Shares of rights to receive
Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election
Forms as follows:

 



 

(i) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash Election Shares
(which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include Shares that are owned by
Dissenting Stockholders) (the " ** _Cash Election Number_** ") is greater than
the Target Cash Conversion Number, then:

 



 

(A) each Stock Election Share and No Election Share (which, for this purpose,
shall be deemed to exclude Shares that are owned by Dissenting Stockholders)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration; and

 



 

(B) the number of Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof that shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount per Share equal to the Per Share
Cash Consideration shall be equal to (x) the number of Cash Election Shares of
such holder _multiplied_ _by_ (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Target Cash Conversion Number, and the denominator of which is the Cash
Election Number, and each of the remaining Cash Election Shares of such holder
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Cash Undersubscribed_. If the Cash Election Number is less than the
Target Cash Conversion Number (such difference between the Cash Election
Number and the Target Cash Conversion Number, the " ** _Shortfall Number_**
"), then:

 



 

(A) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(B) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to exclude Shares that are owned by Dissenting
Stockholders) shall be treated in the following manner:

 



 

(x) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of
No Election Shares, then (1) each Stock Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and (2) the number of
No Election Shares of each holder thereof that shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount per Share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration
shall be equal to (i) the number of No Election Shares of such holder
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of No Election
Shares, and each of the remaining No Election Shares of such holder shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(y) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of No Election
Shares, then (1) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and (2) the number of

 



      
 

 



 

Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof that shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount per Share equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration
shall be equal to (i) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of No Election Shares,
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares,
and the remaining Stock Election Shares of such holder shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Cash Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the Cash Election Number is equal to
the Target Cash Conversion Number, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall
not apply, all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares and No
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

 



 

4.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available or
cause to be made available to an exchange agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the " **
_Exchange Agent_** "), amounts in cash and Parent Common Stock sufficient in
order for the Exchange Agent to distribute the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and the cash portion of the Company Option
Consideration pursuant to Section 4.5(a) (the " ** _Exchange Fund_** "). The
Exchange Agent shall invest the cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned
to Parent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than ten (10) days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of No Election
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) represented by Certificates:
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.3(g)) to the Exchange Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.3(g)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 4.2 and upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.3(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal or Election Form, as the case may be, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested by such holder of record) that such holder is
entitled to receive in respect of such holders properly surrendered
Certificates pursuant to Section 4.2(f), if any, and (B) a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.4) equal to (x) the amount of cash
(consisting of the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 4.3(e)), if any,
that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of such holders properly
surrendered Certificates pursuant to this Article IV, _plus_ (y) any cash
dividends and other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 4.3(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver
a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions payable thereon pursuant to Section 4.3(c) shall automatically
upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each Book-Entry Share (A) that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of record) that
such holder is entitled to receive in respect of such holders Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(f), if any, and (B) a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.4) equal to (x) the amount of cash
(consisting of the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 4.3(e)), if any,
that such holder is

 



      
 

 



 

entitled to receive in respect of such holders Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
Section 4.2(f), _plus_ (y) any cash dividends and other distributions that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 4.3(c), and the Book-
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
and, whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in
respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after
the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section
4.3(g)) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article IV.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 4.3(g)), there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such surrender.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Holders of Book-Entry Shares that are entitled to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(f) shall be
issued and/or paid (A) at the time of payment and delivery of such shares of
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.3(b)(ii), the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, all other dividends and
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time to the extent such holder
holds shares of Parent Common Stock on the applicable record date.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. The Per Share Merger Consideration delivered in accordance
with the terms of this Article IV upon the surrender of the Certificates (or,
automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been
delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares (other
than the right to receive the payments and deliveries contemplated by this
Article IV). From and after the

 



   

     
 

 



 

Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV.

 



 

(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in
respect of a holders Shares. In lieu thereof, any holder of Shares entitled
to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section
4.3(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, which payment shall be
calculated by the Exchange Agent as an amount equal to the product of (i) such
holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the
Parent Trading Price. All fractional shares to which a single record holder of
Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive hereunder shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including cash, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that
has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.4) upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " **
_Person_** " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
distribute the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each Share
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(h) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person that has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and

 



      
 

 



 

until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right
to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that
are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal by Dissenting Stockholders, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



 

4.4. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.

 



 

4.5. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase Shares (a " ** _Company Option_** ") under the
Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall cease to represent an option to
purchase Shares and will be converted automatically into (1) options to
purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Shares subject
to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided_ _by_ (B) the Conversion
Ratio and (2) the right of the holder of such Company Option to receive, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a whole share of Parent Common
Stock that would have resulted from the calculation pursuant to the preceding
clause (1) but for the rounding specified therein and (ii) the Parent Trading
Price (rounded up or down, as applicable, to the nearest whole cent), less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such cash payment
(the resultant Parent Common Stock option and right to cash specified in
clauses (1) and (2), the " ** _Company Option Consideration_** "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined
in a manner consistent with the

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ _further_ that in the
case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Company Stock purchasable
pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided
above, following the Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, " ** _Conversion Ratio_** " shall mean the Exchange Ratio, unless
the provisions of Section 4.1(a)(ii)(x) or (y) are applicable, in which case
the " ** _Conversion Ratio_** " shall mean the _sum_ of (i) the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as in effect pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii)(x) or (y), as
applicable) _multiplied_ by 67%, _plus_ (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration _multiplied_ _by_ (B)
33% by (y) the Parent Trading Price.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a **** " **
_Company RSU_** ") under the Stock Plans shall accelerate in full, and each
Company RSU shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company RSU to receive as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied_ _by_ (y) the Per Share RSU Consideration, _less_ applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For purposes of this
Agreement, " ** _Per Share RSU Consideration_** " shall mean the Per Share
Cash Consideration unless the provisions of Section 4.1(a)(ii)(x) or (y) are
applicable, in which case the "Per Share RSU Consideration" shall mean the sum
of (i) the product of the Per Share Cash Consideration _multiplied_ _by_ 33%,
plus (ii) 67% _multiplied_ _by_ the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio (as in
effect pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii)(x) or (y), as applicable) and (y) the
Parent Trading Price.

 



 

(c) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Stock Plans or
other Benefit Plans or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder
is required under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " ** _Securities Act_** "),
Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **
_SEC_** ") on the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to such interests or Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for
so long as the relevant Stock Plans or other Benefit Plans, as applicable,
remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required.

 



 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections
4.5(a) and 4.5(b). Parent shall take all actions which are necessary for the
assumption of the Company Options pursuant to Section 4.5(a), including the
reservation, issuance and

 



      
 

 



 

listing of Parent Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 4.5. The Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options or Company RSUs.

 _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (B) and (C), such
event, change, effect or occurrence shall be taken into account to the extent
it has a

industry and/or the online advertising industry.

 



 

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 Shares

obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or

rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares

any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations that give the holders thereof the right to vote (or are
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter. For

restrictions, rights of way, easements, covenants, encroachments and other
imperfections of title and (II) zoning entitlement, land use, environmental

repairmens or other similar Liens that arise or are incurred in the ordinary
course of business, and (E) other customary Liens levied, assessed or imposed

the Company and its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to be material.

 



 

(iii) Section 5.1(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary, and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person other than securities in a publicly traded company held
for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of
less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company.

 



 

(iv) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the
Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per
share of Company common stock equal to or greater than the fair market value
of a share of Company common stock on the date of such grant, (C) was duly
authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company Option
was by its terms to be effective by all necessary action, including, as
applicable,

 



      
 

 



 

approval by the board of directors of the Company, and (D) qualifies for the
Tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the Companys
Tax returns and the Company Reports, respectively.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Opinion of Financial Advisor_.

 



 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, subject only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the total voting power of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote
on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly called and held for such
purpose (the " ** _Requisite Company Vote_** "). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " **
_Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_** ").

 



 

(ii) At a meeting duly called and held prior to execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the board of directors of the Company (A) unanimously determined
that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions and
resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the
" ** _Company Recommendation_** "), (B) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption as promptly as
practicable and (C) received the written opinion of its financial advisor,
Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc. (" ** _Houlihan Lokey_** "), to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares in the Merger pursuant

connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions,
except those that the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in

Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914, Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of 20th January
2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings, **** and all other

purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions will
not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under,
or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or

of a Lien, other than a Permitted Lien, on any of the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license, contract,
note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other contract, agreement,
commitment, instrument or obligation (each a " ** _Contract_** ") binding on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of their respective
properties, rights or other assets are subject that involves, or would
reasonably be expected to, involve aggregate payments by or to the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 or, assuming (solely with
respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger and the other Transactions), compliance with the matters referred to in

Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants with
respect to any debtors or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims that,
in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (excluding cash and cash equivalents).

 



 

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the " ** _Exchange Act_** ") or the Securities Act (such filed or
furnished forms, statements, reports and documents, including any amendments
thereto, the " ** _Company Reports_** "). Each of the Company Reports, at the
time of its filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Company Reports (the " ** _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_** "). As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

 



 

(ii) The Company is and has been since July 19, 2012 in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the NASDAQ.

 



 

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company is made known to the individuals responsible for the preparation of
the Companys filings with the SEC on a timely basis. The Company maintains
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control

 



      
 

 



 

over financial reporting is sufficient in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys board of
directors (x) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
To the Companys knowledge, no material formal complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have
been received by the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company
has not received any material complaints through the Companys whistleblower
hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding
possible violations of Law. No attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the board of
directors or to the board of directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant
to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating
such reporting.

 



 

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Company Reports. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " ** _Affiliate_** " when used with respect to any party shall mean
any Person that is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405
promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

(v) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in

 



      
 

 



 

all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity (deficit) and cash
flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules), fairly presents, in all material
respects, or in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the
case may be, of such companies for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), and each of the
foregoing financial statements was prepared or, in the case of Company Reports
filed or furnished after the date of this Agreement, will be prepared in each
case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.

 



 

(vi) Subject to any reserves set forth in the Company Reports, the accounts
receivable shown on the Company Reports represent valid, _bona fide_ claims
against debtors for sales and other charges. The amount carried for doubtful
accounts and allowances disclosed in the Company Reports was calculated in
accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with prior periods. To the
Companys knowledge, there is no contest, claim, defense or right of setoff,
other than returns in the ordinary course of business, relating to the amount
or validity of such accounts receivable.

 



 

As used herein, the terms " ** _to the Company s knowledge_**" or " ** _to
the knowledge of the Company_** " mean the actual knowledge of Steven Hafner,
Paul English, Keith Melnick, Melissa Reiter and Karen Klein, after due
inquiry.

 



 

(f) _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record
books and other records of the Company, all of which have been made available
to Parent, are accurate and complete in all material respects.

or to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase,
redemption or other acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries;

 



 

(D) there has not been any material change in any method of accounting or

its Subsidiaries of any material bonus, made to any director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries of any material profit-sharing or similar payment,

establishment, adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective bargaining,
bonus, profit sharing, thrift, compensation, employment, termination,
severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the

(F) there has not been any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) Since July 19, 2012, there has not been any change in the financial
condition, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any event, change, effect or occurrence which, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) except as reflected or
reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (and the notes
thereto) included in the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement and for obligations or liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2011,
obligations or liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be
disclosed, or any other facts or circumstances that, to the knowledge of the
Company, could reasonably be expected to result in any claims against, or
obligations or liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including those relating to matters involving any Environmental Law, except
for those that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any
judgment, order, decision, writ, injunction, decree, stipulation or legal or

in or necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted by the Company.
Each such material item of tangible personal property is in all material
respects in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

 



 

(j) _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(i) Section 5.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of each material Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, " ** _Benefit Plans_** " shall mean all "employee benefit plans"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" ** _ERISA_** ") or "voluntary employees
beneficiary associations," under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, in each case
covering current or former employees, directors or consultants of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and each other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, practice, contract, agreement or other arrangement providing
retirement, severance, termination or change in control payments, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, stock-based or other equity-based, incentive, bonus, supplemental
retirement, profit sharing, insurance, medical, welfare, fringe or other
benefits or remuneration of any kind, whether or not in writing and whether or
not funded, in each case, which is sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or
required to be maintained or contributed to, or with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates. The Company has separately identified in
Section 5.1(j)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) each Benefit Plan that
contains a change in control provision and (ii) each Benefit Plan that is
maintained primarily for the benefit of employees outside of the United States
(a " ** _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_** "). For purposes of this Agreement, " **
_ERISA Affiliate_** " means all employers (whether or not incorporated) that
would be treated together with the Company or any of

 



      
 

 



 

its Subsidiaries as a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code.

 



 

(ii) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to
Parent, to the extent applicable, true, correct and complete copies of (A) the
Benefit Plan document, including any amendments thereto, and all related trust
documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, (B) a written
description of such Benefit Plan if such plan is not set forth in a written
document, (C) the most recently prepared actuarial report, (D) the most recent
summary plan description together with the summary or summaries of all
material modifications thereto, (E) the most recent Internal Revenue Service
(" ** _IRS_** ") determination or opinion letter, (F) the two most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 or 990 series and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto), and (G) all material correspondence to or from
the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or any other Governmental Entity received in the last three years
with respect to any Benefit Plan.

 



 

(iii) Each Benefit Plan, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " ** _Multiemployer Plan_** ") and Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans, (each, a " ** _U.S. Benefit Plan_** ") has been established,
operated and administered in substantial compliance with its terms and
applicable Laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. Each U.S.
Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances that could
reasonably be expected to affect adversely the qualified status of any such
U.S. Benefit Plan. Neither the Company, any Benefit Plan nor any trustee,
administrator or other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof,
has engaged in any breach of fiduciary responsibility or any "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) to which Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies
and which could subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to a material tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
that would reasonably be expected to result in a material civil penalty under
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material liability or penalty under
Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(iv) Neither the Company, any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate (x)
maintains or contributes to or has within the past six years maintained or
contributed to any Benefit Plan that is subject to Subtitles C or D of Title
IV of ERISA or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or

 



      
 

 



 

(y) maintains or has an obligation to contribute to or has within the past six
years maintained or had an obligation to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan.

 



 

(v) All material contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as
of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the
most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Company filed or incorporated by
reference in the Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation relating to the U.S. Benefit
Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any U.S. Benefit Plan or collective
bargaining agreement.

 



 

(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any U.S. Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year.

 



 

(viii) Neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (w) entitle any
employees or consultants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement, (x) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of
the Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans
which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code.

 



 

(ix) No Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any person with any amount of
additional compensation or gross-up if such individual is provided with
amounts subject to excise or additional taxes imposed under Sections 4999 or
409A of the Code.

 



 

(x) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with applicable
local law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date of
this Agreement, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened material litigation relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses; Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(i) Since June 30, 2011, the businesses of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any
rule, regulation, standard, judgment, Order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, or License of, issued, promulgated or
entered into by or with, any Governmental Entity (collectively, " ** _Laws_**
"), except for violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except
with respect to regulatory matters covered by Section 5.1(d)(i), no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same. To the knowledge of the Company,
no material change is required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
processes, properties or procedures in connection with any such Laws, and the
Company has not received any written notice of any material noncompliance with
any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in
compliance with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity or third party (" **
_Licenses_** ") necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties,
rights and other assets and to conduct its business and operations as
presently conducted, except those the absence of which, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and all such Licenses are in full force and effect.
No default under, or violation of, any such License has occurred, except for
any such default or violation that, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To
the Companys knowledge, there has not been threatened any revocation,
modification, cancellation or transfer of any material Licenses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

Reports, as of the date hereof, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a

Company and each of its Subsidiaries (to the extent they are party thereto or
bound thereby) and, to the Companys knowledge, each other party thereto has
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under each Material Contract. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is not (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) in breach

Company, no other party to any Material Contract is (with or without notice,

Parent Reports); or (y) the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent on the date of this
Agreement (the " ** _Parent Disclosure Letter_** ") (or disclosed in any other
section, subsection or clause of the Parent Disclosure Letter, _provided_ that
it is reasonably apparent, upon a reading of the disclosure, that such
disclosure is applicable or otherwise responsive to such section, subsection
or clause of this Section 5.2), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally,
hereby represent and warrant to the Company that:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization

business as currently conducted, and is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets, properties or the conduct of
its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available
to the Company, prior to the date of this Agreement, complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent, in each case
as amended to the date of this Agreement. The certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Parent are in full force and effect, and Parent is not in material
violation of their respective terms.

 



 

As used herein, the term " ** _Parent Material __ Adverse Effect_**" means any
event, change, effect or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, business or results of operations of Parent taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, and no event,
change, effect or occurrence arising out of or resulting from the following,
shall constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect or be considered in
determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would be
reasonably likely to occur:

 



 

(A) the execution of this Agreement and/or the announcement thereof, the
pendency or consummation of the Merger and/or the other Transactions, the
performance of or compliance with this Agreement by any party with its
covenants set forth herein and/or taking or not taking any actions at the
request of, or with the express consent of, the Company including without
limitation, any litigation arising from or related to this Section 5.2(a)(A)
and/or threatened or actual impact on relationships of Parent with customers,
vendors, suppliers, distributors, landlords or employees);

 



 

(B) changes in the economy, financial markets or economic conditions generally

(E) a decline in the price, or a change in the trading volume, of the Parent

clause (F) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or
contributing to

 



      
 

 



 

any such failure or prevent any of such underlying causes from being taken
into account in determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has
occurred except to the extent such underlying causes are otherwise excluded
pursuant to any of clauses (A) through (E) or clause (G) of this Section
5.2(a)(ii));

 



 

(G) any outbreak, escalation or occurrence after the date of this Agreement of
significant hostilities in which the United States or any other jurisdiction

or sabotage within such jurisdictions or directed against the facilities of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries wherever located;

 



 

 _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (B) and (C), such
event, change, effect or occurrence shall be taken into account to the extent
it has a disproportionately adverse effect on Parent compared to other
companies operating in the online travel industry.

 



 

(b) _Capitalization of Parent_.

 



 

(i) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock, of which 49,865,461 shares of Parent Common Stock were
outstanding as of the close of business on November 2, 2012 and 150,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01, of Parent, of which no shares were
outstanding as of the close of business on November 2, 2012. All of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Other than 2,394,644 shares of
Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance under Parents employee or director
benefit plans, Parent has no shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for
issuance. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens,
and not subject to any preemptive rights or any restrictions on resale under
the Securities Act, other than restrictions imposed by Rules 144 and 145 under
the Securities Act.

 



 

(ii) Except as stated above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate Parent to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of
Parent, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Parent does not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations that give the holders thereof the right
to vote (or convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for securities
having the right to vote) with

 



      
 

 



 

the stockholders of Parent on any matter. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party with respect to the holding, voting, registration, redemption,
repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of, any capital
stock or other voting securities or equity interests of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

(c) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement
and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities
or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

(d) _Corporate Authority_. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions.
The vote or consent of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub (which
shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary
to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and is a valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

 



 

(e) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Etc._

 



 

(i) Other than (i) the filing by Parent of the Form S-4 of which the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is a part, (ii) (A) the filing of a Notification
and Report Form by Parent pursuant to the HSR Act and the termination of the
waiting period required thereunder, and (B) such filings as may be necessary
to obtain the receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of approvals
or waiting periods required under all other applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii)
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and state
securities, takeover and "blue sky" Laws, (iv) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (v) any
notice pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, no Consents are
required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, or are required to be
obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially

 



      
 

 



 

delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions.

 



 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other Transactions will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, or conflict with the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or
right of termination), modification, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or default under, the creation
or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien, other than
a Permitted Lien, on any of the assets of Parent pursuant to any Contracts
binding upon Parent or to which any of its properties, rights or other assets
are subject that involves, or would reasonably be expected to, involve
aggregate payments by or to the Parent in excess of $1,000,000 or, assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.2(e)(i), under any Law to which Parent is subject, except, in the
case of clause (B) above, for any such breach, violation, termination,
default, creation, acceleration or change that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(f) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(i) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
Parent Reports furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act. Each of the Parent Reports, at the time of its filing or
being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(ii) Parent is and has since December 31, 2010 been in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of NASDAQ.

 



 

(iii) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
is made known to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents
filings

 



      
 

 



 

with the SEC on a timely basis. Parent maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is
sufficient in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of Parents internal control over financial reporting prior
to the date of this Agreement, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of
Parents board of directors (x) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting. To
Parents knowledge, no material formal complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been
received by Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has not received
any material complaints through the Parents whistleblower hotline or
equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Law. No attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to Parents chief legal officer, audit committee (or other committee
designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or to the board of
directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Parent policy contemplating such reporting.

 



 

(iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent in its published financial statements or other
Parent Reports.

 



 

(v) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, in all material respects, or, in the case of Parent Reports
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
changes in shareholders equity (deficit) and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes

 



      
 

 



 

and schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, or, in the case of
Parent Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in
all material respects, the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and
changes in financial position, as the case may be, such companies for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

 



 

(vi) Subject to any reserves set forth in the Parent Reports, the accounts
receivable shown on the Parent Reports represent valid, _bona fide_ claims
against debtors for sales and other charges. The amount carried for doubtful
accounts and allowances disclosed in the Parent Reports was calculated in
accordance with GAAP and in a manner consistent with prior periods. To
Parents knowledge, there is no contest, claim, defense or right of setoff,
other than returns in the ordinary course of business, relating to the amount
or validity of such accounts receivable.

 



 

As used herein, the terms " ** _to Parent s knowledge_**" or " ** _to the
knowledge of Parent_** " shall mean the actual knowledge of Jeffery Boyd,
Daniel Finnegan and Peter Millones, after due inquiry.

 



 

(g) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent, and Parent
is not a party to or subject to the provisions of any Order, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 



 

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2011, there has not been
any change in the financial condition, business or results of operations of
Parent or any event, change, effect or occurrence which, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(i) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
in writing by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the Form S-4, including the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus forming a
part thereof, will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the
time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they

 



      
 

 



 

were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any
information provided by or required to be provided by the Company and/or by
its auditors, legal counsel, financial advisors or other consultants or
advisors specifically for use in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 



 

(j) _Ownership of Shares_. Before the action of the board of directors of the
Company on November 8, 2012, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates was or
became an "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL) of the Company. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) any Shares.

 



 

(k) _Available Funds_. Parent and Merger Sub have available to them, or as of
the Effective Time will have available to them, all funds necessary for the
payment to the Exchange Agent of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
and to satisfy all of their obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(l) _Taxes_.

 



 

(i) All material federal Tax Returns and Tax Returns with respect to a
material amount of Tax that are required to be filed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of time in which to make such filings); all such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects and all income, franchise, and
other material amounts of Tax due and owing by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been duly and
timely paid (after giving effect to any valid extensions of time in which to
make such filings or payments), except with respect to matters contested in
good faith;

 



 

(ii) (A) no issues that have been raised by the relevant taxing authority in
writing in connection with any examination of any Tax Returns referred to in
clause (i) above that are or would reasonably be expected to be material to
parent are currently pending, (B) no such Tax Return is currently being
examined by any taxing authority, (C) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from a taxing authority that it
intends to conduct such examinations and (D) all deficiencies asserted or
assessments made, if any, as a result of any such examinations that would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect have been paid
in full, settled or withdrawn;

 



 

(iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any "listed
transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011 4(b)(2); and

 



 

(iv) neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor to Parents knowledge, any other
Affiliate of Parent, has taken or agreed to take any action, or knows of any

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(m) _Compliance with Laws_. Since June 30, 2011, the businesses of each of
Parent and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in
violation of any applicable Law, except for violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except with respect to regulatory matters
covered by Section 5.2(e)(i), no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for
violations that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(n) _Acknowledgement by Parent_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on any representations or warranties
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except for the representations and warranties in Section 5.1. The
representations and warranties by the Company contained in Section 5.1
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in connection
with the Transactions and each of Parent and Merger Sub understands,
acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and warranties of any
kind or nature, whether express, implied or statutory, are specifically
disclaimed by the Company.

Subsidiaries nor any of its or their respective officers and directors shall,
and that it shall instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys,

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to

or

 



 

(C) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, at any time
following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that was made on or after the

Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request
therefor by a Person that has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than fifty percent (50%)
of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company (by
acquisition, merger or otherwise) if the Company receives from the Person so

less restrictive to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement ( _provided_ that any such confidentiality agreement shall expressly
permit the Company to provide copies of forms of agreements in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal to Parent and its Representatives as contemplated in
Section 6.2(e) and any such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
standstill provision) and promptly

 



      
 

 



 

discloses (and, if applicable, contemporaneously provides copies of) any non-
public information so provided to Parent to the extent not previously provided
to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with

approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal and/or authorize the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only
to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause
(ii)(A), (ii)(B) or (ii)(C) above, the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (y) in each such case referred to
in clause (ii)(A) or (ii)(B) above, the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (ii)(C) above,
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " means any proposal or offer made by a Person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub) relating to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of (A) 15% or more of the consolidated total assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 15% or more of the
total voting power of the equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% of more of the total voting
power of the equity securities of the Company, or (iii) any merger,
consolidation, exclusive license, business combination, recapitalization,
joint venture, partnership, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person
or its stockholders would beneficially own 15% or more of the total voting
power of the equity securities of the Company resulting, directly or
indirectly, from any such transaction, in each case other than the
Transactions.

 



 

" ** _Superior Proposal_** " means a written, fully financed and _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of the Company has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, is
reasonably likely to be consummated substantially in accordance with its
terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions, in each case, after taking into account
all relevant factors including all terms and conditions of such

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (including any revisions to the terms
of the Transactions contemplated by Section 6.2(e) and the time likely to be
required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to
"15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "more than 50%").

 



 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.2,
the board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of
directors shall not:

 



 

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or announce any intention
to withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Recommendation;

 



 

(ii) fail to recommend unequivocally against acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer that is publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent) prior to the earlier of (i) the date prior to the date of
the Stockholders Meeting and (y) eleven (11) business days after the
commencement of such tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act or recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their
Shares in such tender offer or exchange offer;

 



 

(iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus distributed to the Companys stockholders in connection
with the Stockholders Meeting;

 



 

(iv) make any other public statement of the board of directors of the Company
or a committee thereof in connection with the Stockholders Meeting that is
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation; or

 



 

(v) approve, adopt, recommend, or resolve or publicly propose to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses
(i) through (v) being referred to as a " ** _Change of Recommendation_** ");
_provided_ that any determination of the board of directors of the Company or
any committee thereof to provide, or the provision of, a Superior Proposal
Notice shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but
subject to Section 6.2(e), prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained, if an Acquisition Proposal has been made on or after
the date hereof, the board of directors of the Company may make a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, (i)
such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2;
and (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) in light of such

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal, failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Prior to making any Change of Recommendation in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal (to the extent permitted under Section 6.2(d)): the
Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice (a " ** _Superior Proposal
Notice_** ") stating that the board of directors of the Company intends to
take such action pursuant to Section 6.2(d) and intends to cause the Company
to enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, a full form of which
shall be delivered with such notice together with full forms of any related
documents. During the three (3) business day period commencing on the date of
Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (the " ** _Negotiation
Period_** "), the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available
for the purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice
ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Any written proposal made by Parent to amend
this Agreement during the Negotiation Period shall be considered by the board
of directors of the Company in good faith before any determination that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section
6.2(d). Each time the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal are amended, the Company shall be required to deliver to Parent a new
Superior Proposal Notice (including as attachments thereto a copy of the most
current version of the new Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to such
amended Acquisition Proposal and copies of any related documents) and the
Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional two (2) business days
from the date of Parents receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice.

 



 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, the board of directors of
the Company or any committee thereof shall make any Change of Recommendation,
except in accordance with this Section 6.2; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall any "Stop-Look-and-Listen" communication
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or similar required
communication be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation or to violate this
Section 6.2.

 



 

(g) _Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and shall instruct and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause their respective directors, officers and other Representatives to,
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with, or any solicitation or
intentional assistance or encouragement of, any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) which are on-going as of the date hereof. The Company
shall take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities
referred to in the preceding sentence of the obligations in this Section 6.2
and pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it
will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of acquiring the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return all confidential information
furnished to such Person prior to the date hereof by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreements or
standstill agreements entered into with any Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal if requested to do so by Parent.

 



 

(h) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this Section 6.2, the Company shall
promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it,
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall (x) keep Parent informed, on a timely basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations and (y) provide to
Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent by or provided to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

6.3. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws all action
reasonably necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (the " ** _Stockholders
Meeting_** ") as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, cause
such vote to be taken and completed as soon as practicable and shall not
postpone or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or with
the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to the extent
necessary to permit the board of directors of the Company to continue
negotiations in respect of any pending Superior Proposal, _provided_ that the
Company has complied, and continues to comply, with its obligations in respect
of any such Superior Proposal under Section 6.2. Subject to Section 6.2(d) and
Section 6.2(e) hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall recommend
such adoption and include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 



 

6.4. _Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus_. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement and in any event within
thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall
jointly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the NASDAQ listing
standards, (ii) provide the other party (and its outside counsel) with a
reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

opportunity to review and comment on the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus prior to the filing by Parent of any such document or any
amendment or supplement thereof with the SEC, (iii) have the Form S-4 declared

filing, (iv) cause the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after such declaration of
effectiveness, and (v) keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in
order to permit the consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Company shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
Subsidiaries and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
and Parent shall furnish all such information concerning itself and such other
matters as may reasonably be required, in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. No filing, amendment, supplement or distribution of the
Form S-4 will be made without provision to Parent and the Company of a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 so that such document would not include any misstatement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be included
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly prepared by the party to which such amended or supplemented
disclosure relates and, to the extent required by applicable Law, filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such party shall, prior to the filing of such amended or
supplemented disclosure with the SEC, provide the other party (and its outside
counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
amended or supplemented disclosure. The parties shall notify each other
promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance
of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, the Form
S-4 or the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4, the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and, in connection therewith, the parties
shall reasonably cooperate with each other to promptly respond to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff and, prior to any party submitting a
response, provide the other party (and its outside counsel) with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such response.

 



 

6.5. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_.

 



 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
Transactions as soon as practicable, including by (i) making appropriate
filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act, and (ii)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all other
Consents of or by any Governmental Entity that are necessary or advisable
under or in respect of any Antitrust Laws in order to consummate the Merger
and the other Transactions, including the Consents set forth on Schedule
7.1(b)(ii) (collectively, the " ** _Antitrust Consents_** "); _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its
Affiliates to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties or other
consideration to any third party in order to obtain any consent or approval
which may be required under any Contract with any such third party in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. The Company and Parent shall
each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the
Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to the further provisions hereof and to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, it is agreed that
Parent, after consulting with the Company and considering the Companys views
in good faith, and in a manner consistent with its obligation pursuant to this
Section 6.5 to obtain the Antitrust Consents, shall make all decisions, lead
all discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and coordinate all
activities with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions,
consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought by or from,
any Governmental Entity in respect of Antitrust Consents, including
determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise respond, by litigation
or otherwise, to objections to, or proceedings or other actions challenging,
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. In all cases
subject to Section 6.5(c), Parent shall take all actions set forth on Section
6.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. At Parents request, and subject to
the provisions of this Section 6.5, the Company agrees to take all actions
Parent reasonably deems prudent in order to obtain any actions, consents,
undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from any Governmental Entity for or
in connection with, and to assist Parent in litigating or otherwise contesting
any objections to or proceedings or other actions challenging, the
consummation of the Merger and other Transactions, and the Company shall take
or agree to take any actions requested by Parent in connection with obtaining
the Antitrust Consents to the extent they become effective only at or
following the Effective Time. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 6.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be obligated to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Impact on its current or
future businesses or operations. For purposes of this Section 6.5(c), " **
_Material Impact_** " means a significant and ongoing adverse financial or
operational impact that is of sufficient magnitude that, if known at the time
thereof, a reasonable businessperson would not have proceeded with the Merger,
after weighing the anticipated benefits of such Merger against the adverse
consequences of the proposed condition or actions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Impact on the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. The party asserting
that a Material Impact has occurred shall bear the burden of proof.

 



 

(d) Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees and other costs incurred
by Parent or the Company in order to obtain the Antitrust Consents, including
reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company in connection with any
review of, inquiry into, investigation of, or challenge to the Transactions,
and shall promptly reimburse the Company for any such filing fees and other
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in respect thereof.

 



 

(e) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Entity. Neither party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing. The parties will provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. The parties shall take reasonable best efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall enter into any change of control,
strategic investment or similar transaction or Contract to effect any such
transaction (including any merger or acquisition), or take any other action in
pursuit of the foregoing, in each case with respect to any one or more of the
entities identified on Schedule 6.5(f) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or any
of their respective Affiliates, if the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing could reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or increase
the time required, to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) and
Section 7.1(c).

 



 

6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, assets, books, contracts, Tax Returns, and records and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties, finances, operations, assets, litigation matters, environmental
compliance, cash-flow reports and personnel as may reasonably be requested;
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the
Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests
for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.7. _NASDAQ Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of the options to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company Options hereunder (the "
** _Listed Parent Common Shares_** ") to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ
prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten (10) days after the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to no longer be quoted on
NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 



 

6.8. _Publicity_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other prior
to issuing, and shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as required by applicable Law

 



      
 

 



 

or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
applicable national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service (in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party).

 



 

6.9. _Employee Benefits and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with (i) base
salaries and cash bonus opportunities (including annual and long-term cash
bonus opportunities, but excluding any equity compensation) that are no less
than the base salaries and cash bonus opportunities (but excluding any equity
compensation) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time,

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys
and its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements identified in Section

_New Plan_** ") to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and
level of benefits thereunder service by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company, except to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or for any frozen (as of
the date hereof) New Plans. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods and any other
eligibility requirements of such New Plan for such employee and his or her
covered dependents to the extent they were inapplicable to, or were satisfied
under, the Benefit Plans, and (y) cause any expenses incurred by any employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries and his or her covered dependents pursuant

ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins, to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such

 



      
 

 



 

employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year under
the New Plan as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the New Plan.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Companys 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that in the event Parent requests that the
Companys 401(k) Plan be terminated, Parent shall cause (i) one or more of the
New Plans that constitute a qualified defined contribution plan maintained for
the benefit of participants under such 401(k) Plan to accept tax-free
rollovers, including promissory notes, from such 401(k) Plan with respect to
the accounts of employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and (ii) all
active participants under the Companys 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be eligible immediately following the Effective Time to
participate in such New Plan.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall (i) be treated as an amendment
to any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce
the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular plan or

Subsidiaries (the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments,
inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred by such
individual in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), in each
case whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance all expenses as
incurred to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are advanced
provides

 



      
 

 



 

an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
individual is not entitled to indemnification).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time to obtain "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " ** _D andO Insurance_**") with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 350% of the current annual premium amount for the Companys DandO
Insurance. If the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to retain and maintain
in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
DandO Insurance, at no expense to the beneficiaries, with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of 350% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance and, provided, further, that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain as of the
Effective Time provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
officers and employees than are presently set forth in the Companys articles
of incorporation and By-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified (by merger or otherwise) for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

 



 

(d) If the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.11.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable from and after the Effective Time by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to, and shall not in any way limit, any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 



 

6.12. _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the
Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and its board of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such Transactions.

 



 

6.13. _Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the
other of any stockholder litigation against it or any of its directors or
officers arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions and shall keep the other reasonably informed regarding any such
stockholder litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other
reasonable opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement
of any such stockholder litigation and shall give due consideration to the
other partys advice with respect to such stockholder litigation.

 



 

6.14. _Tax Matters_. Parent and the Company will (i) use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to constitute a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) not take any action, or fail to take any action
required hereby, that could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver
officers certificates containing appropriate representations at such time or
times as may be reasonably requested by their respective outside legal
counsel, including on or prior to the effective date of the Form S-4 and the
Closing Date, for purposes of rendering opinions with respect to the tax
treatment of the Merger. None of the parties shall take or cause to be taken
any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of such certificates or
representations.

 



 

6.15. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
reasonably necessary, each of Parent and the Company shall take all such steps
as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the Transactions, including any
dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such
Shares) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or who

 



      
 

 



 

will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

upon the earliest to occur of such events, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. For purposes of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall

funds; _provided_ that unless Parent and Merger Sub are in breach of their
obligations hereunder at the time of termination such that the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) are not satisfied or capable of being
satisfied as of the date of termination, the maximum amount that Parent shall
be obligated to reimburse the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5(d) is
$1,500,000 in the aggregate.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the Merger and the other
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Parent
or the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due to the other party
pursuant to this Section 8.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, such other
party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the party that has
failed to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the prevailing party the costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF, THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Merger and the
other Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in
any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit
or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, proceeding or
transactions shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.7 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT

 



      
 

 



 

BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.5.

 



 

9.6. _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of a party hereunder to consummate the Merger) were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations under this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including the terms and provisions hereof requiring a party hereunder to
consummate the Merger) in any of the courts of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance relief on the basis that a party has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



 

(b) Subject to Sections 8.5(a) and 8.5(e), but notwithstanding Section 9.6(a),
in the event that the Termination Fee is paid (or may become payable pursuant
to Section 8.5(c)) by the Company to Parent in accordance with Section 8.5,
the payment of the Termination Fee (or, in the event of a termination hereof
that may result in an obligation of payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.5(c), the right to receive such payment as and when specified
therein, to the extent such payment becomes payable and is paid) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation in this Agreement by the Company, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current
or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members,
stockholders, assignees, representatives or Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligations relating to or arising out of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of
Parent, if any, to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to this Section 9.6 prior
to any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

9.7. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. No party shall be bound by, or be liable
for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention
not contained herein.

 



       
 

 



 

9.9. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) (which shall inure to
the benefit of the persons benefiting therefrom, who are expressly intended to
be third-party beneficiaries thereof), Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

 



 

9.10. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

9.11. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due, and Parent and Merger Sub will indemnify the Company against
liability for any such Taxes.

 



 

9.12. _Definitions_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, each of the
terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set
forth opposite such term.

 



 

9.13. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.14. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, Annex of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation" or words of like import. The use of the
masculine, feminine or neuter gender, or the singular or plural form of words
used herein (including defined terms) shall not limit any provision of this
Agreement. Reference herein to a particular Person includes such Persons
successors and assigns to the extent such successors and assigns are permitted
by the terms of any applicable Contract. Reference to a particular Contract
(including this Agreement), document or instrument means such Contract,
document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect from time to time
in accordance with the terms thereof. Any reference to a particular Law means
such Law as amended, modified or supplemented (including all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder) and, unless otherwise provided, as in
effect from time to time. The terms "cash" and "$" mean United States Dollars.
The use of the terms "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto" and words of similar
import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
Article, Section, paragraph or clause of, or Annex to, this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 



 

9.15. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.
