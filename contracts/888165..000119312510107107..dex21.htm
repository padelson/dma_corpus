ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in
Article VI, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on the later of (a) on the
second Business Day immediately following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, (other than any conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and (b) the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no fewer than two
Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the final day of the Marketing
Period, or such other place and time or on such other date as the Parent and
the Company may mutually determine (the date on which the Closing actually
occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ").

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will duly execute and file a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger will
become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other subsequent date
or time as the Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the DGCL.

 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the
Company will be restated as a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, to
read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_, until thereafter amended in
accordance with such certificate of incorporation and applicable Law.

 

1.6 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended in their entirety to be in the form of  _Exhibit B_ , until
thereafter amended in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, such bylaws and applicable Law.



 

2 1.7 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

1.8 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, the Parent, Merger Sub,
any holder of any capital stock of the Company or any other Person:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will automatically be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $33.86
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), whereupon such shares of Common Stock will
cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder thereof will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.4. 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock or (ii) that is owned by the Parent or Merger Sub
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company will automatically be converted into one fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Awards; Company Deferred
Stock Units_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Equity Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions (including adopting any plan amendments) as are required to
provide that, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(e) or as 



 

3  agreed between the Parent and any holder thereof: (i) each then-outstanding
Company Stock Option granted under any Company Equity Incentive Plan, whether
or not exercisable, shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective
Time in exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option (for the avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Company Stock Option with
a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall not be entitled to receive any payment with respect to
such Company Stock Options); (ii) each then-outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Award granted under any Company Equity Incentive Plan shall be
cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for payment of
an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) the Merger Consideration; and (iii) each then
outstanding Company Deferred Stock Unit heretofore granted under any Company
Equity Incentive Plan shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective
Time in exchange for payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Stock
Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the Merger
Consideration. All such cash payments to be paid pursuant to the immediately
preceding clauses (i) through (iii) shall be referred to herein as the "
_Equity Incentive Amounts_ ". Any Equity Incentive Amounts shall be paid by
the Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time through the
payroll of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.4(d). In the
event that the Surviving Corporation has insufficient cash to make such
payment to each holder of Company Deferred Stock Units, Company Restricted
Stock Awards and Company Stock Options, the Parent shall pay such amounts or
provide to the Surviving Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions
to provide that, with respect to the ESPP and the SAYE, (i) on and after the
date hereof no new offering period may be initiated and no new payroll
deduction authorizations may be given effect and (ii) with respect to any
offering period currently underway, no participant will be entitled
to increase his or her rate of contributions. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary actions to provide that, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock held by participants under the ESPP
will be automatically exercised on the earlier of the day before the Closing
Date or the last day of such offering period, unless the participant withdraws
from the ESPP prior to such date, and any remaining cash held in a
participants account under the ESPP after such date shall be distributed to
such participant as soon as practicable. With respect to options to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock held by participants under the SAYE, the
Company will cooperate with the Parent in determining an appropriate course
of action, with the intent to treat such options in a manner similar to the
treatment of options outstanding under the ESPP.

 

2.2 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such shares (the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who 



 

4  complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided for in Section 2.1. Any such
stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such stockholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Shares held by any
stockholder who shall have failed to perfect, withdrawn or lost such
stockholders rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 2.1.

(b) The Company shall give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL, and the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
Parent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law,
and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Paying Agent (as
applicable).

2.4 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will designate a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company will be
reasonably acceptable to the Parent) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
to receive the funds to which stockholders of the Company will become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and the Parent will enter into a paying agent
agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Company and the Parent, for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At
the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company an amount
of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except
as set forth herein. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent; _provided_ ,



 

5   _however_ , that such investments must be (x) in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (y) in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by either Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or (z)
in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and
undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at
the SEC or otherwise). No such investment or losses thereon will affect the
Merger Consideration payable under this Agreement, and the Parent
will promptly provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than two Business Days after the
Closing Date), the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each record holder of, as of the Effective Time, (i) an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii)
shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_
"): (A) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
shares of Common Stock (which will be in customary form reasonably agreed upon
by the Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, and will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the letter of transmittal); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares of Common Stock for payment of the Merger
Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
Paying Agent will pay from the Payment Fund to the holder of a Certificate or
of Book-Entry Shares, or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal,
the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share will forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment will have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or will
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with
the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that
(x) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 am (New York time) on the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
number of shares of Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time

 



 

6  multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "),
and (y) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 am (New York time) on the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 

(c) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Promptly following the end of the 12-month
period beginning on the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds in the Payment
Fund which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest
and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it), and thereafter such holders who have not received the Merger
Consideration therefor may surrender such Certificate or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, such shares of Common Stock to the Surviving Corporation and,
subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws, receive in
consideration therefor the aggregate Merger Consideration that may be payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
such shares of Common Stock held by them, without interest or dividends
thereon.

(d)  _Payment of Equity Incentive Amounts_. The Parent will take all actions
necessary so that, at or after the Effective Time, upon delivery of a duly
executed and completed letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Parent and the Company (the " _Option Letter of
Transmittal_ "), to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Company Deferred Stock Units,
Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Stock Options granted under any
Company Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Incentive Amounts to which such
holder is entitled as determined in accordance with Section 2.1(d) through the
Surviving Corporations or applicable Subsidiarys payroll, unless
alternative arrangements are specified by such holder in the Option Letter of
Transmittal, to the extent permitted thereby. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of
Company Deferred Stock Units, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company
Stock Options, the Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving
Corporation sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, there will be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such shares of Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or
any other reason, they will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II.

(f) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will
be liable to any stockholders of the Company or other person in respect of any
cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any



 

7  portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by stockholders of the
Company as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation or
Paying Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may be, pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Common Stock previously evidenced by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

contemplated hereby. When executed and delivered by the Company,
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each Ancillary
Agreement to which it is party, and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated thereby, will have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors

in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is
subject to general principles of equity. Upon receipt of the Merger Consent,

Directors, in each case, its opinion, dated as of the date of this Agreement
(together, the " _Fairness Opinions_ "), substantially to the effect that, as
of such date and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations contained therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company (other than Parent and any of its Affiliates)
pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such stockholders from a financial point
of view.

 

(d) The Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or

provision in their financial statements in accordance with GAAP for payment of
all material amounts of Taxes that are not yet due and payable.

contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) the executed equity commitment
letter, dated as of May 3, 2010 among the Parent, Silver Lake Partners III,
L.P., Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, L.P. and Warburg Pincus X Partners,
L.P. (collectively, the " _Investors_ ") (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_
" and together with the Debt Financing Commitment, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, each of the Investors has committed to invest
the cash amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and together
with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). None of the Financing
Commitments has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement,
and, as of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date hereof, there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements to which the Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to any of
the Financing Commitments that could affect the availability of the Financing.
As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the
Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of the Parent, the other parties
thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing (including any "flex"
provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.2 and performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, in the aggregate and together with
the available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of the Company,
will be sufficient for the Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and to provide Interactive Data (Europe)
Limited with sufficient funds to make the deposit into the Escrow Account of
the amount of £53 million contemplated by the UK Pension Transitional
Agreement, the amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and all related
fees and expenses. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which would
result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by
the Parent or Merger Sub under the Financing Commitments, and the Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to the
Parent on the Closing Date. The Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the
Financing Commitments.

 

(b) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 7.4(b), the obligations of the

regarding the Parents, Merger Subs, their respective Affiliates, or any
other Persons ability to obtain financing for the consummation of the

of the Companys directors, officers or



 

25  employees regarding employment after the Closing; or (d) sold, or offered to
sell, any direct or indirect equity interest in the Company to any of the
Companys directors, officers or employees.

4.7 _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective
Time will have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred
no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein.

 

4.8 _Information Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at the date it
is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives which is contained or incorporated by reference in the
Information Statement.

 

4.9 _Ownership of Common Stock_. As of the date of this Agreement, except for
the Voting Agreement that is being executed and delivered concurrently
herewith, none of the Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates owns
(directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any shares of Common Stock
and none of the Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates holds any
rights to acquire or vote any shares of Common stock except pursuant to this
Agreement.

4.10 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of the Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have

vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.11 _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage or finders fees or commissions in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries for which the Company could have any Liability prior to the
Effective Time.

4.12 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Financing Commitments, including the Financing, the payment of the Merger
Consideration and the provision to Interactive Data (Europe) Limited of the
funds required to be deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to the
Pensions Transitional Agreement and the making of such deposit by Interactive
Data (Europe) Limited and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may
be contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth



 

26  herein, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Article III and the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder in all material respects, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (a) as of such date will be able to pay its
debts as they become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value
greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute
and mature; and (b) shall not have, as of such date, unreasonably small
capital to carry on its business in which it is engaged. For purposes of this
definition, "not have, as of such date, unreasonably small capital to carry on
its business in which it is engaged" means that the Surviving Corporation will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions
or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they
become due.

4.13 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article III, each of the Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges (a) that neither the Company nor any other person on behalf of
the Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided to the Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) that neither the Company
nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to the Parent, Merger Sub or any other person
resulting from the distribution to the Parent or Merger Sub, or the Parents
or Merger Subs use of, any such information, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to the
Parent or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms" or management presentations or in
any other form in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries Representatives to, cease immediately any existing discussions
or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal. With respect to any Person

31  Section 7.1, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or facilitate, any inquiries, proposals
or offers from any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act) (other than the Parent and its Subsidiaries) that
constitute, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a proposal or offer
for, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (A) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 10% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole), (B) the direct or indirect acquisition of a 10% or greater interest
of the outstanding Common Stock or aggregate voting power of the Company or
(C) the direct or indirect acquisition of 10% or more of the consolidated
assets or assets representing 10% or more of the consolidated revenues
(including, in each case, securities of the Companys Subsidiaries) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), or (ii)
engage or participate in any discussions (other than to state that they are
not permitted to have discussions and to refer to this Agreement) or
negotiations (including by way of furnishing non-public information regarding
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) relating to, or which would reasonably
be likely to lead to, any Alternative Proposal.

(c) Following the date of this Agreement, if the Board of Directors receives a
bona fide written Alternative Proposal within 15 days of the date of this
Agreement and if the receipt of such Alternative Proposal did not result from
a breach of this Section 5.4 or Section 3.3 of the Voting Agreement (except to
the extent such breach was immaterial and unintentional), until the
expiration of 30 days after the date hereof (after which time the Company and
its Representatives shall cease immediately any action described in clause (A)
and (B) below), the Company or its Representatives may, if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor) that the Alternative Proposal is, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal if, but only if, (x) in the
case of either of the immediately preceding clauses (A) or (B), the Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (A), the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and such information
is furnished to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after it has been
furnished to such Person to the extent not previously furnished to Parent.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt), notify the Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt
of any Alternative Proposal, any inquiries relating to an Alternative Proposal
or any request for information from, or any negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with, either the Company or its Representatives
concerning an Alternative Proposal. The Companys notice shall include (i) a
copy of any Alternative Proposal made in writing and other written materials
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) a written summary
of the material terms of such Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request,
including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the
Alternative 



 

32  Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status or developments regarding any
Alternative Proposal, inquiry or request. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement
that would prohibit them from providing such information to Parent.

 

(e) Except as set forth herein, the Board of Directors (or any committee
thereof) will not (i) (A) change, qualify, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to change, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to the
Parent, the Board Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company,
an Alternative Proposal or (C) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares
of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an Alternative Proposal is
commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the Company stockholders (including, for these purposes, by
taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by its stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within
10 Business Days after commencement thereof, (ii) terminate, amend, waive, or
exempt any Person or group from, the restrictions contained in any standstill
agreements or any Takeover Laws or otherwise cause any such restrictions
therein not to apply (other than to the extent the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take any of such actions under this clause (ii) would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
is necessary to facilitate an Alternative Proposal in compliance with Section
5.4(c)), (iii) approve, authorize or permit or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger or acquisition
agreement or any similar agreement or understanding with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
permitted under Section 5.4(c)) (each of the foregoing, an " _Alternative
Proposal Agreement_ ") or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to any of the
foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , if (x) the Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, that a bona fide written Alternative Proposal received by the
Company in compliance with Section 5.4(c) constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(y) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with this Section 5.4 and the Stockholder Parent (as defined in the Voting
Agreement) has complied in all material respects with Section 3.3 of the
Voting Agreement, prior to 30 days after the date of this Agreement, then the
Board of Directors may allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any Alternative Proposal Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
and thereafter effect any transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may only take
the actions described in the immediately preceding proviso if at such time the
Company is permitted to terminate, and terminates, this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) concurrently with entering into such Alternative Proposal
Agreement and pays the Company Termination Fee in compliance with Section
7.2(a)(ii) and if:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least four days in advance, of its or the Board of Directors
intention to take such actions, which notice shall specify the material terms
of the Alternative Proposal received by the Company that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with, and the identity of, the party making the Alternative
Proposal;



 

33 (ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and
Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) during such four-day period to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing Commitments as would
permit the Company or the Board of Directors not to take such actions; and

(iii) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes
to this Agreement and the Financing Commitments that may be offered in writing
by Parent by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the fourth day of such four-day period in
a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and
shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors that the Alternative Proposal received by the
Company would continue to constitute, or would result in, a Superior Proposal
if such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect.

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal (it being
agreed that material revisions shall include any change in the purchase price,
form of consideration, transaction timing, transaction financing or
transaction structure for such Superior Proposal), the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i) and to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.4(e)
with respect to such new written notice, except that the deadline for
such new written notice and the corresponding negotiation period shall be
reduced to two days.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 will prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors, failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or
recommend any Alternative Proposal) unless the applicable requirements of
Section 5.4(e) shall have been satisfied.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and the Companys outside counsel, is more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger,
taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal (including the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof) and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed
to by the Parent to the Company in writing in response to such Alternative
Proposal or otherwise); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "10%" in the definition of Alternative
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

34 5.5 _Regulatory Matters and Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement and before
the expiration of any relevant legal deadline, make or cause to be made all
premerger notification filings required of each of them and or any of their
respective Affiliates including (i) to the United States Federal
Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, the

filed no later than ten Business Days after the date hereof, unless the
parties mutually agree to extend the deadline), (ii) to the European
Commission, the filing of a merger notification in accordance with the ECMR
(which filing shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, unless the parties mutually agree to extend the deadline), (iii)
to the competent authority of any member state of the European Union to which
any of the transactions contemplated hereby are referred pursuant to Article 9
of the ECMR (which filing shall be made as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of such referral, unless the parties mutually agree to extend
the deadline), and (iv) to the appropriate Governmental Entities, filings
under any Other Antitrust Laws as identified in _Section 5.5 of the
Disclosure Schedule_ (which filings shall be made as reasonably promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, unless the parties mutually agree to extend
the deadline).

 

(b) Each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the
HSR Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Laws for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by Law, shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from any Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request. The Company and the Parent shall not take, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to take, any action with the intention
to or that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of
clearance or any necessary approval or early termination of any required
waiting period by or from any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act, any
Other Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent shall take
any and all action reasonably necessary (i) to avoid the entry or enactment of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order under any applicable antitrust
or competition Law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order under any
applicable antitrust or competition Law is entered, issued or enacted, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
materially delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate,
avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened Order under any
applicable antitrust or competition Law so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, such action by the Parent shall
include: (x) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate
and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or the Parent or 



 

35  their respective Subsidiaries, (y) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or the Parent or their

any divestiture, or other structural or conduct modification relating to the
business of the Company or the Parent or their respective Subsidiaries. The
Company shall take, and cause its Subsidiaries to take, such of the foregoing
actions as Parent may request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action
is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Alternatively, at the
request of the Company, the Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to
contest until it becomes final and nonappealable, administratively or in
court, any ruling, Order or other action of any Governmental Entity or any
other Person challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of the Parent and the Company agrees to instruct its respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any
issues arising under the HSR Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any other
applicable Laws at the earliest practicable dates. Said reasonable best
efforts and cooperation include, but are not limited to, counsels
undertaking (to the extent permitted by applicable Law and in each case
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without waiving
attorney-client or any other applicable privilege) to (i) furnish to each
others counsel such reasonably necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act, any Other Antitrust
Laws and any other applicable Laws, (ii) permit the other partys counsel to
review and incorporate such other partys counsels reasonable comments in any
filings or other communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party related to antitrust or
competition Laws with any other Person, and (iii) permit the other partys
counsel to review attachments and appendices to filings and any other
submissions necessary under the HSR Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any
other applicable Laws including but not limited to documents required under
Item 4(c) of the HSR notification form and Section 5.4 of the Form CO. None of
the Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates or counsel
shall independently contact any Governmental Entity or participate in any
meeting or discussion (or any other communication by any means ) with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of the Parent and
its Affiliates, the Company, and in the case of the Company and its
Affiliates, the Parent, where practicable, prior reasonable notice of the
meeting or discussion, the opportunity to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and responses to personnel of said Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to review and comment on the contents of any
representations (oral or otherwise) expected to be communicated at the
meeting or discussion, and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate at the meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of the Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agree to use its respective best efforts to obtain promptly any
clearance required under the HSR Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any other
applicable Laws for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if such clearance is not received by the later of (i) the date that
is 120 days following the date hereof or (ii) the date on

 



 

36  which all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing). 

5.6 _Press Releases and Public Announcement_. None of the Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company will issue any press release or make any public announcement
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written approval of, in the case of the
Parent and Merger Sub, the Company, and in the case of the Company, the
Parent; _provided_ , that each party may issue any such press release or make
such public announcement it believes in good faith is required to be made by
applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation promulgated by
any applicable securities exchange after consultation with legal counsel, in
which case the disclosing party will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to advise and consult with the other parties regarding any such press release
or other announcement prior to making any such disclosure.

5.7 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date hereof
and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable prior written notice of the
Parent, permit the Parent and its Representatives and Financing Sources
to have (at the Parents expense) reasonable access at all reasonable times,
and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, to the officers and senior
management, the premises, agents, customers, suppliers, books, records, and
Contracts of or pertaining to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as the
Parent may reasonably request in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parent will not have access to (i) individual performance or evaluation
records or medical histories, (ii) information that is subject to attorney-
client privilege or other privilege, or (iii) information that in the opinion
of the Company would result in a breach of a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are bound, or (vi) information related to the
Companys sale process; _provided_ , _further_ , that such access will comply
with all applicable Laws and all applicable real property leases regarding
the premises and shall not include any intrusive testing or environmental
sampling of any kind; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no such access
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or the remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Parent shall not discuss any proposed employment arrangements or equity
investments in the Parent with the officers and senior management of the
Company until after the 15th day from the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_
, that if (i) the Board of Directors receives a bona fide written Alternative
Proposal within 15 days of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the Person
making such Alternative Proposal agrees to be bound by the same obligations by
which the Parent is bound under this proviso and the immediately preceding
proviso, then the Parent shall not discuss any proposed employment
arrangements or equity investments in the Parent with the officers and senior
management of the Company until the earlier of (x) the termination
or withdrawal of such Alternative Proposal or (y) the 31st day from the date
hereof.

(b) The Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent of any event
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Parent and Merger Sub will give
prompt written notice to the Company of 



 

37  any event that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company, the Parent and Merger
Sub will give prompt written notice to the other parties of (i) any facts
relating to such party which would make it necessary or advisable to amend the
Information Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading
or to comply with applicable Law, (ii) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity or other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby and (iii) any Actions
commenced or, to the knowledge of such party, threatened against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) will not limit, expand or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder (if any) to the party receiving such notice.

(c) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence
all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
furnished to the Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with (i) the letter agreement, dated January 22, 2010, between the Company
and Silver Lake Management Company III, L.L.C. and (ii) the letter agreement,
dated January 11, 2010, between the Company and Warburg Pincus LLC
(collectively, the " _Non-Disclosure Agreements_ "), which Non-Disclosure
Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms.

 

5.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Benefits
Continuation Period_ "), the Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for
those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue as employees
of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries during the Benefits Continuation Period (the "
_Company Employees_ "), (i) at least the same level of base salary or wages
(as applicable) and aggregate annual cash incentive bonus and commission
opportunities and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided as of the date hereof by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company to such Company Employees
pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans and the Affiliate Benefit Plans
(excluding, for purposes of currently provided benefits, any equity or equity-
based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits
or transaction or retention bonuses). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, severance and any similar
benefits to Company Employees that are no less favorable than the
severance and similar benefits currently provided under the Company Benefit
Plans and the Affiliate Benefit Plans for the Benefit Continuation Period,
including by recognizing all service recognized for such purposes under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan. 



 

38 (b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, where length of service is relevant under any
benefit plan or arrangement of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_"), the employees
(including officers) of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive service
credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any respective
predecessors) to the same extent such service credit was granted under the
Company Benefit Plans or Affiliate Benefit Plans, except to the extent any
such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time or satisfaction of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New
Plans to the extent that (A) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under a Company Benefit Plan or Affiliate Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the
" _Old Plans_") and (B) such Company Employee has satisfied all waiting time
and other eligibility requirements under the Old Plan being replaced by the
New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent
shall cause (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plan and (y) any expenses incurred by any
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance and termination plans and agreements (including change
in control provisions) with employees or independent contractors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, perform its obligations under the UK Pension
Agreements, and shall provide or cause there to be provided to the Surviving
Corporation any funds required by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation to comply with its obligations thereunder.

 

(e) Solely for the purpose of this Section 5.8, " _Affiliate Benefit Plans_ "
shall mean such Benefit Plans in effect as of the date hereof without giving
effect to any amendments, modifications or supplements to such Benefit Plans
on or after the date hereof or any new Benefit Plans adopted on or after the
date hereof, unless, in each case, the Parent previously has consented in
writing to such amendment, modification or supplement or new Benefit Plan.
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended (i) to require the Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to
establish or maintain any specific Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan or arrangement for any length of time; or (ii) to create or amend
any Company Benefit or other employee benefit plan or arrangement. 



 

39  This Section 5.8 is included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not
create any right in any Person, including any Company Employee or Company
Service Provider, or any other participant in any Company Benefit Plan,
Affiliate Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement that may
be established or maintained by the Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the Merger, or any
beneficiary or trustee thereof. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, any
right to employment or continued employment for any period of time, or any
right to a particular term or condition of employment.

5.9  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.9, shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six
years from the Effective Time, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
subject to compliance with applicable Law, shall maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws
or similar organization documents as in effect immediately prior to the date
hereof or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
set forth on _Section 5.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_ with any of their
current or former respective directors, officers or employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, subject to compliance with
applicable Law, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim. From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall assume, be jointly
and severally liable for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.9.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings required by applicable Law),
to the same extent that such persons are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect as
of the date hereof, each current and former director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law and following receipt
of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities 



 

40  and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
Actions, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, member, trustee
or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the
benefit of the Company, before the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company), including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to
enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party. In the event of any such Action, the Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Action. 

(c) The Parent shall obtain prior to the Effective Time fully-paid six-year
"tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail_") with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance of the type and with the amount of coverage as
set forth on _Section 5.9(c) of the Disclosure Schedule_, subject to any
limitations set forth therein, with respect to the directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and with such other terms as are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those in the directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company as of
the date hereof and with respect to which complete and correct copies have
been made available to the Parent prior to the date hereof. Prior to
purchasing the DandO Tail, the Parent shall allow the existing directors of the
Company to review the terms of the DandO Tail and will consider, without
obligation, comments such directors may have in respect thereof. The Parent
shall maintain the DandO Tail in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation,
and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for
such insurance pursuant to this Section 5.9(c).

 

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the DGCL, directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended
to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, each of
whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.9.

 

(f) In the event the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or

 



 

41  (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

5.10 _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium", "control share", "fair price",
"affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other anti-takeover laws
and regulations of any Governmental Entity is or may become applicable to the
Merger, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on the Merger.

 

5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
or replace, the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver
or replacement (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount)
or (y) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date,
(II) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments ( _provided_ that the Parent
and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof), including using
its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to the
Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth
therein that are within its control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment (and provide copies thereof to the Company) and (iv) upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments,
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, the Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions
no less favorable to the Parent and Merger Sub and in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby promptly following the
occurrence of such event. The Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide the Parent and Merger Sub
with any portion of the Financing. The Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources providing Debt
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing



 

42  required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement if all conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (x)
all or any portion of the Debt Financing has not been consummated, and (y)
all conditions set forth in Article VI hereof have been satisfied or waived
(other than the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(c) but subject
to the satisfaction of such conditions) and the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to Section 1.2, each of the Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the
proceeds of the bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
to be used to cause the Closing to occur. For purposes of this Section 5.11
and Section 4.4, references to "Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments as permitted by this
Section 5.11 to be amended, modified or replaced and references to "Financing
Commitments" shall include such documents as permitted by this Section 5.11 to
be amended, modified or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment,
modification or replacement. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide to
the Parent and Merger Sub, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the officers, employees, advisors and other Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide to the Parent and Merger Sub, all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by the Parent in connection with the
Financing, including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and
sessions with prospective Financing Sources, investors and ratings agencies,
and reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Parent and
Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, in each case in connection with the
Financing; (ii) furnishing the Parent, Merger Sub and their Financing Sources
as promptly as practicable with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in
writing by the Parent, including all financial statements and financial and
other data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for registered offerings of debt securities, and of the
type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including pro forma
financial information), and other documents required to satisfy any customary
negative assurance opinion, to consummate the Financings at the time the
Financings are to be consummated, including all information and data necessary
to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5, 6 and 9 of Exhibit D of
the Debt Financing Commitment (information and data required to be delivered
pursuant to this clause (ii) being referred to as the " _Required Financial
Information_ "); (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing; (iv) executing and delivering any necessary
pledge and security documents and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral,
guarantees, mortgages, other definitive financing documents or other
certificates or documents as may reasonably be requested by the Parent; (v)
obtaining a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters to the extent required by the Financing Sources,
customary authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda
and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating
to the Debt Financing; (vi) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance at the expense of and as reasonably requested by the Parent

 



 

43  on behalf of the Financing Sources; (vii) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation
of such Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to the Company, including entering into one or more credit
agreements, indentures and/or other instruments on terms satisfactory to the
Parent in connection with such Debt Financing immediately prior to
the Effective Time to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrence by the
Company is contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment; and (viii) providing
unaudited consolidated monthly financial statements of the Company (excluding
footnotes) consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and statement of
cash flows to the extent the Company customarily prepares such financial
statements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business

Contract in connection with obtaining any such consent or approval that is
adverse in any material respect to the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and (iii) the parties acknowledge that the receipt of such
consents pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall not be deemed a condition to any
partys obligation to effect the Merger, except to the extent specifically set
forth in Article VI.

 

5.16 _Tax Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to the Parent, on or before
(but no more than 20 days prior to) the Closing Date, in a form reasonably

the Parent, that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section

the Surviving Corporation to post or cause to be posted a replacement letter
of credit to replace each Existing Letter of Credit (to the extent still
outstanding as of the Effective Time). Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall cooperate with the Parent in good faith to assist in and arrange for
such replacement letters of credit to be posted as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

pay and reimburse the Stockholder (or its Affiliates, if applicable) for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Stockholder may incur as a result
of being required to make any payment under the Existing Letters of Credit
after the Closing Date as a result of the failure of the Stockholder (or its
Affiliates, as applicable) to be fully released from the Existing Letters of
Credit.



 

45 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.17 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, the
Stockholder, which is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section
5.17.

 

5.18 _Termination of Agreements with the Stockholder and its Affiliates_.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, at the request of
the Parent, execute an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the
parties terminating all Contracts between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Parent and any of its
other Affiliates, on the other hand (except for the Ancillary Agreements and
such other Contracts identified on _Section 5.18 of the Disclosure
Schedule_), and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay
any termination or similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other
liability to the other parties to such Contracts in connection therewith.

reasonable operational requirements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to

to the United Kingdom (including by direct or indirect transfers of cash,

alone. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.4, including
the limitations set forth in Section 7.4(b), the parties acknowledge and
agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of

delivered to Parent and Parents sources of Debt Financing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,

Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the
Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no event
shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of
this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this Sections 7.4(b) or 7.4(c). For the avoidance
of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as

permitted by Section 7.2(b)), under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance and
payment of the Parent Termination Fee. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter, including by demanding Parent and/or Merger Sub to file one or more

obligations thereunder and Parents and Merger Subs rights thereunder, only

of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at the Closing), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2,
(ii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the financing provided by
the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 5.11, pursuant to the commitments with
respect thereto) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and (iii)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent
and Parents sources of Debt Financing that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur.

 

(d) Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
