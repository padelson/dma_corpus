   | 2.15| U.S. Securities  Law Matters 
---|---|--- 
  

The Parties intend that the Arrangement shall be carried out such that the
issuance of the Consideration Shares and Replacement Options to Company
Securityholders in exchange for Company Shares and Company Options,
respectively, qualifies for the exemption from the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act provided by the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption and
applicable U.S. state securities laws in reliance upon similar exemptions
under applicable U.S. state securities laws. Each Party agrees to act in good
faith, consistent with the intent of the Parties and the intended treatment
of the Arrangement as set forth in this Section 2.15. In order to ensure the
availability of the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption, the Parties agree that the
Arrangement will be carried out on the following basis:

   | (a)| the  Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the Court; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| the  Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties to
rely on the Section 3(a)(10)  Exemption prior to the Court hearing required
to issue the Interim Order; 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| the  Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the
substantive and procedural fairness  of the Arrangement to the Company
Securityholders; 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| the  Court will hold a hearing before approving the procedural
and substantive fairness of  the terms and conditions of the Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| the  Final Order will expressly state that the Arrangement is
approved by the Court as being  substantively and procedurally fair to the
Company Securityholders to whom Consideration  Shares and Replacement Options
will be issued; 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| the  Parties will ensure that each Company Securityholder
entitled to receive Consideration  Shares or Replacement Options on
completion of the Arrangement will (i) be given adequate  notice advising
them of their right to attend the Court hearing and providing them with 
sufficient information necessary for them to exercise that right, (ii) be
advised that  the Consideration Shares and Replacement Options issuable
pursuant to the Arrangement  have not been and will not be registered under
the U.S. Securities Act and will be issued  by Acquiror in reliance on the
Section 3(a)(10) Exemption, and that certain restrictions  on resale under
the securities laws of the United States, including, as applicable, Rule  144
under the U.S. Securities Act, may be applicable with respect to securities
issued  to affiliates of Acquiror, and (iii) be advised that the Section
3(a)(10) Exemption does  not exempt the issuance of securities upon the
exercise of such Replacement Options and,  therefore, the underlying Acquiror
Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Replacement  Options, if any, cannot
be issued in the United States or to a person in the United States  in
reliance upon the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption and the Replacement Options may
only  be exercised pursuant to an effective registration statement or
pursuant to a then available  exemption from the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act and applicable  state securities laws, if any; 
---|---|--- 
  



    

51175158.1| 20 
---|--- 

 



    



  



   | (g)| the  Interim Order will specify that each Company Securityholder
entitled to receive Consideration  Shares or Replacement Options on
completion of the Arrangement will have the right to  appear before the Court
at the Court hearing on the Final Order so long as such Company 
Securityholder enters an appearance within a reasonable time and in accordance
with the  requirements of the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (h)| Acquiror  will request that the Final Order include a statement
to substantially the following  effect: "This Order will serve as a basis of
a claim to an exemption, pursuant  to Section 3(a)(10) of the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from the  registration requirements
otherwise imposed by that act, regarding the distribution of  securities of
Acquiror, pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement." 
---|---|--- 
   | 2.16| U.S. Tax  Matters 
---|---|--- 
  

The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the U.S. Tax Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Agreement, together with the
Plan of Arrangement, is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 368 of the U.S. Tax Code. Each Party agrees to treat the
Arrangement as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
U.S. Tax Code for all United States federal income tax purposes, to treat
this Agreement, together with the Plan of Arrangement, as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 368 of the U.S. Tax Code, and to not take any position on any
Tax return or otherwise take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with such
treatment, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Following the
Effective Date, the Acquiror will prepare and file in accordance with
Treasury Regulations (including by posting a copy on the investor relations
section of its website) an IRS Form 8937 with respect to the Arrangement.
Each Party agrees to act in good faith, consistent with the intent of the
Parties and the intended treatment of the Arrangement as set forth herein and
to use commercially reasonable efforts to not take any action, or knowingly
fail to take any action, if such action or failure to act would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Arrangement from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

   | 7.1| Notice and  Cure Provisions 
---|---|--- 
  

7.1.1 Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until
the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective
Time of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or
would be likely to:

   | (a)| cause  any of the representations or warranties of any Party
contained herein to be untrue or  inaccurate in any material respect on the
date hereof or at the Effective Time; or 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| result  in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied  with or satisfied by any Party
hereunder prior to the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 
  

7.1.2 Acquiror may not exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(iv) and the Company may not exercise its right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(iv) unless the Party
intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and
warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or the applicable condition or
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter and such
matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this Agreement until
the expiration of a period of ten business days from such notice, and then
only if such matter has not been cured by such date. If such notice has been
delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order, such
application and such filing shall be postponed until the expiry of such
period. For greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within
the time period referred to herein without a Material Adverse Effect, this
Agreement may not be terminated as a result of the cured breach.

   | 7.2| Non-Solicitation 
---|---|--- 
  

7.2.1 Neither Party shall, directly or indirectly, through any officer,
director, employee, representative (including any financial or other advisor)
or agent of such Party or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Representatives"): (i) make, solicit, assist, initiate, promote, facilitate
or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
entering into any form of agreement, arrangement or understanding) the
initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) participate, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations
with any person (other than the other Party or any of its affiliates)
regarding, or furnish to any person any information or otherwise co-operate
with, respond to, assist or participate in, an Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, a Party may communicate with any person making an
Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of advising such person that the
Acquisition Proposal could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal; (iii) approve, accept, endorse or recommend, or propose
publicly to accept, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) accept or enter into or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, understanding,
undertaking or arrangement or other contract in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal, or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Arrangement, or providing for the payment of any break, termination or other
fees or expenses to any person in relation to an Acquisition Proposal; (v)
make a Change in Recommendation; or (vi) make any public announcement or take
any other action inconsistent with the recommendation of the Acquiror Board to
approve the Arrangement, in the case of Acquiror, or the Company Board, in
the case of the Company.

7.2.2 Each Party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any persons
conducted heretofore by it, its subsidiaries or any Representatives with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, such Party
will discontinue access to any of its confidential information (and not
establish or allow access to any of its confidential information, or any data
room, virtual or otherwise) and shall as soon as possible request, to the
extent that it is entitled to do so (and exercise all rights it has to
require) the return or destruction of all confidential information regarding
such Party and its subsidiaries previously provided to any such person or any
other person and will request (and exercise all rights it has to require) the
destruction of all material including or incorporating or otherwise
reflecting any material confidential information regarding such Party and its
subsidiaries. Each Party agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries,
shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any
existing confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (it
being acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination of any standstill
provisions of any such agreement as the result of the entering into and
announcement of this Agreement, pursuant to the express terms of any such
agreement, shall not be a violation of this Section 7.2.2) and each Party
undertakes to enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-
solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its subsidiaries have
entered into prior to the date hereof.

  

7.2.3 Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision
of this Agreement or of any other agreement between Acquiror and the
Company, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Securityholder Approval, in the case of the Company, or
the Acquiror Shareholder Approval, in the case of the Acquiror, a Party
receives a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of Section 7.2.1 or 7.2.2 and that the board of directors of
such Party determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, constitutes or, if consummated in
accordance with its terms (disregarding, for the purposes of any such
determination, any term of such Acquisition Proposal that provides for a due
diligence investigation), could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then such Party may, in response to a request made by the party
making such Acquisition Proposal provided it is in compliance with Section
7.2.4:

   | (a)| furnish  information with respect to such Party and its
subsidiaries to the person making such  Acquisition Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| enter  into, participate, facilitate and maintain discussions or
negotiations with, and otherwise  cooperate with or assist, the person making
such Acquisition Proposal; and/or 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| waive  any standstill provision or agreement that would
otherwise prohibit such person from  making such Acquisition Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
  

provided that such Party shall not, and shall not allow its Representatives
to, disclose any non-public information to such person: (i) if such non-
public information has not been previously provided to, or is not concurrently
provided to the other Party hereto; and (ii) without entering into an
agreement with such person substantially in the form of the Confidentiality
Agreement containing terms that are no more favourable to such person than
those found in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that
any such agreement shall not preclude such person from making a Superior
Proposal.

  



    

51175158.1| 63

7.2.4 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party, at first orally
and then in writing within 24 hours of receipt of the Acquisition Proposal,
of the material terms and conditions thereof, and the identity of the person
or persons making the Acquisition Proposal, and shall provide the other Party
with a copy of any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request, a copy of any
agreement entered into in accordance with Section 7.3 hereof and a copy of
any other agreements which relate to the Acquisition Proposal to which it has
access, or any amendment to any of the foregoing. The Party receiving the
Acquisition Proposal shall thereafter also provide such other details of such
proposal, inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing,
as the other Party may reasonably request and shall keep the other Party
fully informed as to the status, including any changes to the material
terms, of such proposal, inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any
of the foregoing, and shall respond promptly to all inquiries from the other
Party with respect thereto.

  

7.2.5 Subject to Section 7.3, (i) at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Securityholder Approval, if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach
of this Section 7.2 and which the Company Board concludes in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, it may, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in Sections 7.4 and 8.2, terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, and
(ii) at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Acquiror Shareholder Approval, if the Acquiror receives an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2 and which the
Acquiror Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it
may, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in Sections 7.4 and
8.2, terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal.

  

7.2.6 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit either Party
from taking any action or making a Change in Recommendation or from
making any disclosure to any of its securityholders prior to the Effective
Time including, for greater certainty, disclosure of a Change in
Recommendation in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, if, in the good faith
judgment of such Party, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
failure to take such action or make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
such board of directors' exercise of its fiduciary duties or such action or
disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law (including by
responding to an Acquisition Proposal under a directors' circular or
otherwise as required under Securities Laws).

  

7.2.7 Each Party shall ensure that its officers, directors and
employees and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees
and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives retained by
it are aware of the provisions of this Section 7.2, and it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 7.2 by such officers, directors,
employees and any financial advisors or other advisors or representatives.

  



   | 7.3| Right to  Match 
---|---|--- 
  

7.3.1 Each Party covenants that it will not accept, approve, endorse,
recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in
respect of a Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill
agreement permitted by Section 7.2.3) unless:

   | (a)| The  Party receiving such proposal (the "Receiving Party") has
complied  with its obligations under Section 7.2 and has provided the other
Party (the "Responding  Party") with a copy of the Superior Proposal and all
related documentation  described in Section 7.2.4; and 
---|---|--- 
  



    

51175158.1| 64 
---|--- 

 



    



  



   | (b)| a period  (the "Response Period") of four business days has
elapsed from the  date that is the later of: (x) the date on which the
Responding Party receives written  notice from the Receiving Party that it
has determined, subject only to compliance with  this Section 7.3, to accept,
approve, endorse, recommend or enter into a binding  agreement to proceed
with such Superior Proposal; and (y) the date the Responding Party  receives
a copy of the Superior Proposal and all related documents described in
Section  7.2.4. 
---|---|--- 
  

7.3.2 During the Response Period, the Responding Party will have the
right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend this Agreement and the Plan
of Arrangement, including modification of the consideration. The Receiving
Party shall review any such offer by the Responding Party to amend this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal to which the Responding Party is responding would continue to be a
Superior Proposal when assessed against the Arrangement as it is proposed in
writing by the Responding Party to be amended. If the Receiving Party
determines that the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, when assessed against this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as
they are proposed to be amended by the Responding Party, the Receiving Party
will cause it to enter into an amendment to this Agreement with the Responding
Party incorporating the amendments to the Agreement and Plan of Arrangement
as set out in the written offer to amend, and will promptly reaffirm
its recommendation of the Arrangement by the prompt issuance of a press
release to that effect. If the Receiving Party determines that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, it may recommend
that holders of its securities accept such Superior Proposal provided that
before doing so it terminates this Agreement and pays the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(ii) or Section 8.2.1(c)(ii), as applicable, in
order to accept or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement to
proceed with the Superior Proposal.

  

7.3.3 Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that
results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of
such consideration) to be received by the holders of the Receiving Party's
securities shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of
this Section 7.3 and the Responding Party shall be afforded a new Response
Period and the rights afforded in Section 7.3.2 in respect of each such
Acquisition Proposal.

  

7.3.4 Where at any time within ten days before the Company Meeting or
the Acquiror Meeting, as applicable, the Receiving Party has provided the
Responding Party with a notice under Section 7.3.1(a) hereof, an Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly disclosed or announced, and the Response Period
has not elapsed, then, subject to applicable Laws, at the Responding Party's
request, the Receiving Party will postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting or
the Acquiror Meeting, as applicable, to a date acceptable to the
Responding Party, acting reasonably, which shall not be later than ten days
after the scheduled date of the Company Meeting or the Acquiror Meeting, as
applicable, and shall, in the event that the Parties amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3.2, ensure that the details of such amended
Agreement are communicated to the shareholders of the Receiving Party prior to
the resumption of the adjourned meeting.

   | 7.4| Expenses  and Termination Fees 
---|---|--- 
  

7.4.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall

Acquiror (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the
Termination Fee.

the  Company Board, acting in good faith, determined that a change, effect,
event or occurrence  had taken place that constituted a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror and that, as a  consequence, it would be inconsistent with
the Company Board's fiduciary obligations  to continue to recommend that

Acquiror Board, acting in good faith, determined that a change,  effect,
event or occurrence had taken place that constituted a Material Adverse
Effect  on the Company and that, as a consequence, it would be inconsistent
with the Acquiror  Board's fiduciary obligations to continue to recommend
that Acquiror Shareholders  vote in favour of the Acquiror Resolution; or

fide Acquisition Proposal, or the intention to make an  Acquisition Proposal,
with respect to the Acquiror shall have been made to the Acquiror  or

 _provided that_ , for the purposes of this Section 7.4.6(e) all references
to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be

7.4.7 If a Company Termination Fee Event described in any of Sections

7.4.11 Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts
set out in this Section 7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages
will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and
the resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. The Company
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, each
Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where a Party is entitled to the Termination Fee and such Termination Fee is
paid in full, such Party shall be precluded from any other remedy against the

judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or

or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection
therewith.

  

7.4.14 In no event shall a Party be obligated to pay to the other Party
an amount in respect of the termination of this Agreement that is, in
aggregate, in excess of the Termination Fee and the Termination Fee shall, in
any case, only be paid once by a Party.

This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant to, and is subject to the
provisions of, the Arrangement Agreement, except in respect of the
sequence of the steps comprising the Arrangement, which shall occur in the
order set forth herein.

  

Article 3 
 ARRANGEMENT

  

3.1 Arrangement

  

At the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur
sequentially in the following order without any further act or formality:

   | (a)| each  Company Share held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall be
deemed to be transferred by the  holder thereof, without any further act or
formality on its part, free and clear of all  liens, claims and encumbrances,
to the Company and the Company shall thereupon be obliged  to pay the amount
therefor determined and payable in accordance with Article 4 hereof,  and:
(i) the name of such holder shall be removed from the central securities
register  as a holder of Company Shares and such Company Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to  be outstanding; and (ii) such Dissenting Shareholders
will cease to have any rights as  Company Shareholders other than the right
to be paid the fair value for their Company  Shares by the Company; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| each  Company Share (other than a Company Share held by a
Dissenting Shareholder or a Company  Share held by Acquiror or any subsidiary
of Acquiror) shall be deemed to be transferred  to Acquiror and, in
consideration therefor, Acquiror shall issue the Consideration for  each
Company Share, subject to Section 3.3 and Article 5; 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| each  Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or  unvested) shall be exchanged for an option
(each a "Replacement  Option") to acquire from Acquiror, other than as
provided herein, the  number of Acquiror Shares equal to the product of: (A)
the number of Company Shares subject  to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the  Exchange Ratio, provided
that, if the foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction  of an
Acquiror Share on any particular exercise of Replacement Options, then the
number  of Acquiror Shares otherwise issued shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number  of Acquiror Shares. The exercise price per Acquiror
Share subject to a Replacement Option  shall be an amount equal to the
quotient of: (A) the exercise price per Company Share  subject to each such
Company Option immediately before the Effective Time; divided by  (B) the
Exchange Ratio, provided that the aggregate exercise price payable on any
particular  exercise of Replacement Options shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. It is  intended that the provisions of subsection 7(1.4)
of the Tax Act apply to the exchange  of a Company Option for a Replacement
Option. Therefore, in the event that the Replacement  Option In-The Money
Amount in respect of a Replacement Option exceeds the Company Option  In-The
Money Amount in respect of the Company Option for which it is exchanged, the
number  of Acquiror Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the
Replacement Option at and  after the Effective Time will be adjusted
accordingly with effect at and from the Effective  Time to ensure that the
Replacement Option In-The Money Amount in respect of the Replacement  Option
does not exceed the Company Option In-The Money Amount in respect of the
Company  Option and the ratio of the amount payable to acquire such shares to
the value of such  shares to be acquired shall be unchanged. All other terms
and conditions of the Replacement  Options, including the term to expiry,
will be the same as the Company Option for which  it was exchanged and each
Replacement Option shall continue to be governed by and be  subject to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the agreement evidencing the 
grant of such Company Option. For greater certainty, any Replacement Options
that are  held by a person who ceases to be an "Eligible Person" pursuant to
the Company  Stock Option Plan shall terminate in accordance with the terms
of the Company Stock Option  Plan. Any document previously evidencing Company
Options will thereafter evidence and  be deemed to evidence the Replacement
Options exchanged therefor and no certificates  evidencing the Replacement
Options will be issued;

   | (d)| each  Company PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be adjusted based  on the Exchange Ratio, the Acquiror shall be
responsible for all obligations in respect  of such PSUs and all conditions
otherwise applicable to such PSU's, including performance  vesting conditions
applicable to such PSUs shall be in accordance with the terms of such  PSUs
and the Company Performance Share Unit Plan; for greater certainty, the
properties  that are the subject of the performance vesting conditions shall
not be adjusted in any  manner; 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| each  Company DSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be adjusted based  on the Exchange Ratio and shall be redeemable
in accordance with its terms and the terms  of the Company Deferred Share
Unit Plan; 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| each  Company Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the
terms of the applicable warrant  indenture, agreement or warrant certificate
such that, following the Effective Time,  (i) such Company Warrant shall be
exercisable to acquire from Acquiror, other than as  provided herein, the
number of Acquiror Shares equal to the product of: (A) the number  of Company
Shares subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective 
Time; multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, provided that, if the foregoing
would result  in the issuance of a fraction of an Acquiror Share on any
particular exercise of such  Company Warrant, then the number of Acquiror
Shares otherwise issued shall be rounded  down to the nearest whole number of
Acquiror Shares; and (ii) the exercise price per  Acquiror Share subject to
such Company Warrant shall be an amount equal to the quotient  of: (A) the
exercise price per Company Share subject to each such Company Warrant
immediately  before the Effective Time; divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio,
provided that the aggregate  exercise price payable on any particular
exercise of such Company Warrant shall be rounded  up to the nearest whole
cent. 
---|---|--- 
  

3.2 Effective Time Procedures

  

Following the receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date,
Acquiror shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to the
Depositary certificates or direct registration ("DRS") advice-statements
representing the Acquiror Shares required to be issued to Former Company
Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1, which
certificates or DRS advice-statements shall be held by the Depositary as
agent and nominee for such Former Company Shareholders for distribution to
such Former Company Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Article
5.

completed Transmittal Letter by a registered Former Company

other documents as the Depositary may require, Former Company Shareholders
shall be entitled to receive delivery of certificates or DRS advice-statements
representing the Acquiror Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.1.

  

3.3 Acquiror Shares

   | (a)| No fractional  Acquiror Shares shall be issued to Former Company
Shareholders. The number of Acquiror  Shares to be issued to Former Company
Shareholders shall be rounded down to the nearest  whole Acquiror Share in
the event that a Former Company Shareholder is entitled to a  fractional
share representing less than a whole Acquiror Share; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| All  Acquiror Shares issued pursuant hereto shall be deemed to
be validly issued and outstanding  as fully paid and non-assessable shares
for the purposes of the BCBCA.

Article 4 
 DISSENT RIGHTS

  

4.1 Dissent Rights

  

Registered Company Shareholders (other than Acquiror and its affiliates) may
exercise dissent rights with respect to Company Shares held by such
Dissenting Shareholders ("Dissent Rights") in connection with the Arrangement
pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA,
as modified by the Interim Order, the Final Order and this Section
4.1; provided that the written notice setting forth the objection of such
registered Company Shareholder to the Arrangement Resolution must be received
by the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the day that is
two Business Days immediately preceding the date of the Company Meeting (as
it may be adjourned or postponed from time to time). Each Dissenting
Shareholder who duly exercises its Dissent Rights in accordance with this
Section 4.1, shall be deemed to have transferred all Company Shares held by
such Dissenting Shareholder and in respect of which Dissent Rights have been
validly exercised, to the Company, free and clear of all Liens, as provided
in Section 3.1(a) and if such Dissenting Shareholder:

   | (a)| is ultimately  entitled to be paid fair value for its Company
Shares, such Dissenting Shareholder: (i)  shall be deemed not to have
participated in the transactions in Article 3 (other than  Section 3.1(a));
(ii) will be entitled to be paid the fair value of such Company Shares  by
the Company, which fair value, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  in section 245 of the BCBCA, shall be determined as of the close
of business on the Business  Day immediately preceding the date on which the
Arrangement Resolution was adopted; and  (iii) will not be entitled to any
other payment or consideration, including any payment  that would be payable
under the Arrangement if such Dissenting Shareholder had not exercised  its
Dissent Rights in respect of such Company Shares; or 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| ultimately  is not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair
value for such Company Shares, such  Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed
to have participated in the Arrangement on the  same basis as a non-
dissenting holder  of Company Shares and shall be entitled to receive only
the Consideration contemplated  by Section 3.1(b) that such Dissenting
Shareholder would have received pursuant to the  Arrangement if such
Dissenting Shareholder had not exercised its Dissent Rights. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

51175158.1| A-7 
---|--- 

 



    



  



  

4.2 Recognition of Dissenting Holders

   | (a)| In no  circumstances shall Acquiror, the Company or any other
person be required to recognize  a person exercising Dissent Rights unless
such person is the registered holder of the  Company Shares in respect of
which such Dissent Rights are purported to be exercised. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| For  greater certainty, in no case shall Acquiror, the Company
or any other person be required  to recognize any Dissenting Holder as a
holder of Company Shares in respect of which  Dissent Rights have been
validly exercised after the completion of the transfer under  Section 3.1(a),
and the name of such Dissenting Holder shall be removed from the register  of
Company Shareholders as to those Company Shares in respect of which Dissent
Rights  have been validly exercised at the same time as the event described
in Section 3.1(a)  occurs. In addition to any other restrictions under
Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA,  none of the following persons shall be
entitled to exercise Dissent Rights: (i) any holder  of a Company Option;
(ii) any holder of a Company Warrant; and (iii) any Company Shareholder  who
votes or has instructed a proxyholder to vote such Company Shareholder's
Company  Shares in favour of the Arrangement Resolution (but only in respect
of such Company Shares).

Article 5 
 DELIVERY OF ACQUIROR SHARES

  

5.1 Delivery of Acquiror Shares

  

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate that
immediately before the Effective Time represented one or more
outstanding Company Shares that were exchanged for Acquiror Shares in
accordance with Section 3.1, together with a duly completed
Transmittal Letter and such other documents and instruments as would have
been required to effect the transfer of the Company Shares
formerly represented by such certificate under the BCBCA and the constating
documents of the Company and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall
deliver to such holder following the Effective Time, a certificate or DRS
advice-statement representing the Acquiror Shares that such holder is
entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1.

  

After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as
contemplated by this Section 5.1, each certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented one or more Company Shares shall be deemed at
all times to represent only the right to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate or DRS advice-statement representing Acquiror Shares that the
holder of such certificate is entitled to receive in accordance with Section
3.1.

  

5.2 Lost Certificates

  

In the event any certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Company Shares that were exchanged in
accordance with Section 3.1 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a certificate
representing Acquiror Shares that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with Section 3.1. When authorizing such delivery of a certificate
representing Acquiror Shares that such holder is entitled to receive in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder to whom a
certificate representing such Acquiror Shares is to be delivered shall, as a
condition precedent to the delivery of such Acquiror Shares, give a bond
satisfactory to Acquiror and the Depositary in such amount as Acquiror and
the Depositary may direct, or otherwise indemnify Acquiror and the
Depositary in a manner satisfactory to Acquiror and the Depositary, against
any claim that may be made against Acquiror or the Depositary with respect to
the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and shall
otherwise take such actions as may be required by the constating documents of
the Company.

5.3 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

  

No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Acquiror Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Company
Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have complied
with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2. Subject to applicable law
and to Section 5.4, at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition
to the delivery of a certificate representing Acquiror Shares to which such
holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest,
the amount of the dividend or other distribution with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Acquiror Shares.

  

5.4 Withholding Rights

  

Acquiror, the Company and the Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable to any
person under this Plan of Arrangement and from all dividends or other
distributions otherwise payable to any former Company Securityholder, such
amounts as Acquiror, the Company or the Depositary is required or permitted to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the U.S.
Tax Code or any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local
or foreign tax law or treaty, in each case, as amended. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to such person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

  

5.5 Limitation and Proscription

  

To the extent that a Former Company Shareholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 on or before the date that is
six years after the Effective Date (the "final proscription date"), then the
Acquiror Shares that such Former Company Shareholder was entitled to receive
shall be automatically cancelled without any repayment of capital in
respect thereof and the certificates or DRS advice-statements representing
such Acquiror Shares shall be delivered to Acquiror by the Depositary and the
share certificates shall be cancelled by Acquiror, and the interest of the
Former Company Shareholder in such Acquiror Shares shall be terminated as of
such final proscription date.
