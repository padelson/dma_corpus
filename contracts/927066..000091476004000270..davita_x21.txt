Agreements, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Purchaser is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the operation
of its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except to
the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of the
Purchaser to carry out its obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, the performance by the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on the part of the Purchaser and no

have been, duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and the Seller) this
Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution the Ancillary Agreements
shall constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser,
enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with their respective
terms.   SECTION 4.02. No Conflict. Assuming compliance with the premerger
notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act and the making
and obtaining of all filings, notifications, consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions referred to in Section 4.03, the

lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise     -23-   or other
instrument or arrangement to which the Purchaser is a party, except, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not reasonably be expected
to materially and adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser to carry out
its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.   SECTION 4.03. Governmental
Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the Purchaser do not and will not
require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of, action by,
filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (a) the
premerger notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act or (b)
where failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action, or
to make such filing or notification, would not prevent or materially delay
the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.   SECTION 4.04. Investment Purpose.
The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely for the purpose of investment
and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof other than in compliance with all applicable laws,
including United States federal securities Laws. The Purchaser agrees that
the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and such Laws.
The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an
indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and (either alone
or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience

the Purchase Price, the Inter-Company Debt and all other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise
necessary to consummate all the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller a true and complete copy of the
Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has
not been amended or terminated in any manner adverse to the Seller. The
Purchaser has taken all actions required to cause the Commitment Letter to be
effective, and the Commitment Letter is a valid and binding commitment of the
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, the financing sources party
thereto. As of the date hereof, the Purchaser is not aware of any fact or
circumstance in existence as of the date hereof that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to the failure to satisfy any condition precedent set
forth in the Commitment Letters.   SECTION 4.06. Litigation. As of the date
hereof, no Action by or against the Purchaser is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened, which reasonably would be expected to affect

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.   -24-     SECTION 4.07. Brokers. Except for J.P. Morgan

conducted its own independent investigation, review and analysis of
operations, Assets, Liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,

representatives. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser

Article III or any certificates delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, none of the Seller, its Affiliates, or any of their
respective officers, corporate directors, employees or representatives make

equity, with respect to the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Shares, the Assets
or the Business.   Article V   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 5.01.

approvals of all Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will
cooperate fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to
make its filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within twenty Business Days of the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act.   (b) Without limiting the generality of the
Purchaser\'s undertaking pursuant to Section 5.04(a), the Purchaser agrees to
use its best efforts, and to take any and all steps necessary, to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any United States governmental
antitrust authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto to
close the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in
any event no later than the Termination Date, including negotiating,
committing to and effecting as promptly as practicable, by consent decree,
hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture or disposition of
such of its assets, properties or businesses or of the Assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the entrance into such
other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry
of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In addition, the Purchaser shall
use its best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring as promptly as
practicable.   (c) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify
the other party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject
of this Agreement or the Settlement Agreements and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority. Neither party to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in     -29-   exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement will
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (d) Neither party shall enter into any transaction, or
any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition)
that might reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase
the time required, to: (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would
materially delay or prevent the completion of the transaction contemplated
hereby, or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.   SECTION
5.05. Retained Names and Marks. (a) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that
all right, title and interest in and to the names set forth on Section
5.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, together with all variations thereof and
all trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, trade dress,
corporate names and other identifiers of source containing, incorporating or
associated with any of the foregoing (the "Retained Names and Marks") are
owned exclusively by the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and
the Subsidiaries) and that, except as expressly provided below, any and all
right of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use the Retained Names and Marks
shall terminate as of the Closing and shall immediately revert to the owner
thereof. The Purchaser further acknowledges that it has no rights, and is not
acquiring any rights, to use the Retained Names and Marks, except as provided
herein.   (b) The Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable after
the Closing, but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter, cause
the Company and each Subsidiary, as applicable, to file amended articles
of incorporation with the appropriate authorities changing its corporate name
to a corporate name that does not contain any Retained Names and Marks and to
supply promptly any additional information and documentary materials that may
be requested by the Seller with respect to such filings.   (c) The Company
and its Subsidiaries shall remove all of the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' existing signage as soon as practicable, but in any event no
later than 180 days after the Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be entitled to use existing signage until such signage is removed in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.05(c).   (d) The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, for a period of 90 days after the date of the Closing, be
entitled to use all of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' existing stocks
of letterheads, advertisements and promotional materials, Internet web sites
and Internet domain names, inventory and other documents and materials
("Existing Stock") containing the Retained Names and Marks. From and after
such date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and each   
-30-   Subsidiary to remove or obliterate all Retained Names and Marks from
such Existing Stock or cease using such Existing Stock, and transfer to the
Seller any rights with respect to Internet domain names incorporating any
Retained Names or Marks.   (e) Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no other right to use the Retained Names and Marks is granted by
the Seller to the Purchaser or the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether by
implication or otherwise, and nothing hereunder permits the Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to use the Retained Names and Marks on any
documents, materials, products or services other than as provided in this
Section 5.05. The Purchaser shall ensure that all use of the Retained Names
and Marks by the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in this Section
5.05 shall be only with respect to goods and services of a level of quality
equal to or greater than the quality of goods and services with respect to
which the Business used the Retained Names and Marks prior to the
Closing.   (f) The Purchaser agrees that the Seller shall have
no responsibility for claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to,
the use by the Business of any Retained Names and Marks after the Closing,
and the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates from any and all claims that may arise out of the use thereof by
the Business.   SECTION 5.06. Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
enter into the Ancillary Agreements.   SECTION 5.07. Financing. (a) From
the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, and to obtain funding under, the
financing provided for in the Commitment Letter. The Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary to satisfy the
conditions precedent set forth in such definitive agreements. In the event
any portion of such financing becomes unavailable, in the manner or from the
sources originally contemplated, the Purchaser will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any such portion from alternative sources.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with the Purchaser\'s financing contemplated by this Agreement, the Seller
will reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser to (i) provide any necessary
financial statements, any audits in connection therewith and any necessary
representation letters addressed to the auditors in connection therewith;
(ii) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide any
customary affidavits required by title insurers; (iii) provide the banks and
other institutions arranging or providing the Purchaser\'s financing all
material information (financial and other) with respect to the Seller and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement reasonably requested by
the Purchaser, it being understood that a request for the provision of
such information which would constitute a violation of Law will be
deemed unreasonable; (iv) cause the Company\'s senior officers and other
Company representatives to be reasonably available to the Purchaser and the
banks and other institutions arranging or providing the Purchaser\'s
financing to participate in due diligence sessions and to participate in
presentations related to any transaction comprising the Purchaser\'s
financing; (v) assist in the preparation of one or more appropriate offering
documents, including MDandA; and business description and assisting the
Purchaser and the banks and other institutions arranging or providing the
Purchaser\'s financing in preparing other    -31-    appropriate
marketing materials, in each case to be used in connection with such
financing; and (vi) request the Seller\'s independent auditors to prepare and
deliver "comfort letters", dated the date of each offering document used in
connection with any transaction comprising the Purchaser\'s financing (with
appropriate bring down comfort letters delivered on the closing date for each
financing), in compliance with professional standards, in each of the
foregoing cases as may be necessary for the Purchaser to obtain the financing
described in the Commitment Letter.   (c) As promptly as practicable, the
Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser the unaudited consolidated statement of
cash flows of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the nine months ended
September 30, 2004 and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2003 and the unaudited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, in each case
prepared in accordance with GAAP.   SECTION 5.08. Further Action. The
parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and to execute and
deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.09. Non-
Competition; Non-Solicitation. (a) For the Restricted Period, Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any Non-Company Affiliates to, engage, directly or
indirectly, in the Restricted Business or, without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage,
operate, or control any Person that is engaged in the Restricted
Business.   (b) The restrictions set forth in Section 5.09(a) shall not
be construed to prohibit or restrict any Person from acquiring Parent or
any Non-Company Affiliates, nor shall they be construed to restrict Parent or
any Non-Company Affiliates from:   (i) acquiring any business engaged in
the Restricted Business,  as long as the percentage of revenues of such
business attributable to  such Restricted Business during the preceding
fiscal year represents  less than 20% of such business\' total revenues in
the Restricted  Territory during such period (based on such business\' latest
financial  statements); provided, however, that Parent or such Non-Company 
Affiliate, as applicable, shall divest that portion of such business 
attributable to such Restricted Business within one year from the date  of
any such acquisition; or   (ii) owning securities having no more than 5% of
the  outstanding voting power of any Person engaged in the Restricted 
Business which are listed on any national securities exchange as long  as
Parent or such Non-Company Affiliate have no other connection or 
relationship with such competitor.   (c) Parent agrees with the Purchaser
that, for the Restricted Period, Parent will not, and will cause the Non-
Company Affiliates not to, induce or attempt to induce any officers or
employees of the Company to leave the employ of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment
arrangements, with the Company or the     -32-   Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the foregoing will not prohibit Parent or any Non-
Company Affiliates from (i) making generalized searches for employees by the
use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by
engaging search firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or focused
on the employees of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii) employing
any person who contacts Parent or any Non-Company Affiliate as a result of
such general, non-targeted solicitations for employment or (iii) hiring any
person whose employment has been terminated by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates.   SECTION 5.10. Inter-Company Arrangements. (a) The Inter-
Company Payables outstanding as of the Closing shall remain outstanding from
and after the Closing Date and shall be paid by the Company in
accordance with their terms.   (b) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
cause all contracts and agreements, other than the Alliance Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, between or among the Company or any
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or any Non-Company Affiliate, on the
other hand, to be terminated or otherwise amended to exclude the Company or
relevant Subsidiary as a party thereto and without further obligation or
liability, other than the Inter-Company Payables, on the part of the Company
or such Subsidiary.   SECTION 5.11. Release of Indemnity Obligations. (a)
Parent covenants and agrees, on or prior to the Closing, to execute and
deliver to the Purchaser, for the benefit of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a general release and discharge, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 5.11.   (b) The Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the unconditional release of Parent and the
Non-Company Affiliates (as applicable) from the guarantees set forth in
Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule at the Closing or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, including by effecting such release by issuing
Purchaser guarantees or other credit support. In the event such releases are
not effected for any reason, the Purchaser shall indemnify Parent and the
Non-Company Affiliates, as applicable, for any and all liabilities arising
from or relating to such guarantees.   SECTION 5.12. Inter-Company Debt. (a)
During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, the Company shall
finance its working capital requirements and operations, including those
items set forth in Section 5.01(h), through borrowing from the Seller, and
the Seller agrees to lend money to the Company as necessary to finance such
working capital and operational needs. All such borrowing shall be reflected
as Inter-Company Debt.   (b) During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use all cash generated by, and not used in
the operation of, the Business to repay the Inter-Company Debt.   SECTION
5.13. Right of First Refusal. For the Restricted Period, the Seller shall not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its dialysis clinics in Puerto
Rico to any Person other than the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser
(a "Proposed Transferee") unless (i) the Seller has received a bona fide
offer from the Proposed Transferee to purchase such clinics (the "Proposed
Transaction") and (ii) the Seller has offered to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of     -33-   such clinics to the Purchaser on the same terms
and conditions as contemplated in the Proposed Transaction (the "Offer"). The
Purchaser shall have the option to accept the Offer and enter into definitive
agreements reflecting the terms of the Offer with the Seller within thirty
(30) days following the date that the Offer was made by the Seller under (ii)
above (the "Offer Period"). In the event the Purchaser does not accept the
Offer and enter into definitive agreements with the Seller within the Offer
Period, the Seller may consummate the Proposed Transaction with the Proposed
Transferee.   Article VI   EMPLOYEE MATTERS   SECTION 6.01. Employee
Benefits. As of the Closing Date, each of the then current employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries ("Current Business Employees") shall continue to
be employed by the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiaries and shall cease
to be covered under the Plans that are not Company Plans, and shall be
covered by either the Company Plans or the corresponding benefit plans of the
Purchaser. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, provide
to the Current Business Employees (a) base salary at least equal to the base
salary in effect for the Current Business Employees as of the Closing Date
and (b) employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (excluding any
equity-based plans) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to the Current Business Employees as of the Closing Date.  
SECTION 6.02. Assumed Plans. As of the Closing Date, each of the current or
former employees of the Seller who participates in a Company Plan shall cease
to be covered under such Company Plan and shall be covered by
the corresponding benefit plan of the Seller. As of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, adopt,
assume or continue to operate, as applicable, the Plans disclosed on Section
6.02 of the Disclosure Schedule ("Assumed Plans") for the benefit of the
Current Business Employees, including arrangements related to obligations for
accrued but unused vacation pay and benefits.   SECTION 6.03. Tax-Qualified
Savings/401(k) Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts (i) to transfer each account of a Current Business
Employee under a defined contribution plan of the Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company or a Subsidiary) to the Gambro Healthcare 401(k)
Retirement Plan, and (ii) to transfer each account of an employee of the
Seller under the Gambro Healthcare 401(k) Retirement Plan to a defined
contribution plan of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or
a Subsidiary).   SECTION 6.04. Severance Plan. For a period of one (1)
year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to, provide the Current Business Employees with
severance protection (including levels of severance and the circumstances
under which severance is payable) that is comparable, taken as a whole, to
the severance benefits currently provided to the Current Business Employees
under the Seller\'s and the Company\'s severance plans as in effect on the
date hereof, copies of which have been made available to the Purchaser.   
-34-    SECTION 6.05. Employee Notification. The Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide each Current Business Employee
with written notice, on or prior to the Closing Date, regarding the type and
level of compensation and benefits that shall be provided by the Purchaser to
such Current Business Employee following the Closing Date.   SECTION 6.06.
Flexible Spending Plans. The Seller shall cause the Company to establish,
effective as of January 1, 2005, one or more replacement flexible spending
plans to replace the Seller\'s medical, dependent care, and commuter expense
flexible spending reimbursement plans (collectively, the "Seller\'s Flex
Plans") for the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries. The terms of
each such replacement plan shall be substantially equivalent to the Seller\'s
Flex Plans. Each such replacement plan shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, be treated as a Company Plan. If requested by the Purchaser, the
Seller shall give the Purchaser the opportunity to review and comment on such
replacement plans, and the Seller shall make such changes consistent with the
foregoing to each such replacement plan prior to adoption thereof as shall be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser.   SECTION 6.07. Service Credit. To
the extent that length of service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or
vesting or benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement (other than benefit accrual for the purposes of any defined
benefit pension plan) established or maintained by the Purchaser or the
Company for the benefit of the Current Business Employees (including any
plan, program or arrangement providing for vacation, sick leave or severance
benefits), such plan, program or arrangement shall credit such Current
Business Employees for length of service on or prior to the Closing Date with
the Company, the Seller or its Affiliates.   SECTION 6.08. Pre-Existing
Conditions; Deductibles. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained
for the benefit of the Current Business Employees or their dependents on and
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and
the Subsidiaries to, waive any pre-existing condition exclusions (if the
condition was covered under the Plans) and provide that any expenses incurred
on or before the Closing Date by a Current Business Employee (or such Current
Business Employee\'s dependents) shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket
provisions.   SECTION 6.09. COBRA. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause
the Company and the Subsidiaries to, be liable and bear all responsibility
for providing health care continuation coverage in accordance with the
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of

dependents and beneficiaries who incur a qualifying event after the Closing
Date. The Seller shall be responsible for providing health care continuation
coverage in accordance with COBRA for Current Business Employees and former
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (and their qualified dependents
and beneficiaries) who incur a qualifying event on or prior to the Closing
Date, except with respect to any such coverage obligation in respect of a
Company Plan.   SECTION 6.10. WARN. The Purchaser shall be responsible for
any obligation with respect to the Current Business Employees under the
Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 and any applicable
state or local equivalent arising or accruing on or     -35-   after
the Closing Date (collectively, "WARN"). The Seller shall be responsible for
any such obligation arising or accruing before the Closing Date.   SECTION
6.11. Assumption of Employment Agreements. Effective as of the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, honor or assume, as
applicable, (i) the employment agreements with Current Business Employees
listed on Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the employment
agreements with the individuals listed on Section 6.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule who are not employed by the Company or a Subsidiary,
which individuals shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be treated as
Current Business Employees.   SECTION 6.12. Certain Plan Obligations. The
Seller shall remain liable for the payment of all compensation and benefits
arising under any Plan that is not a Company Plan (including all claims for
such compensation or benefits, whenever occurring) to the employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. For purposes of clarification of the preceding
sentence, (i) the Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay
all medical, dental, life insurance, short-term disability and other long-
term disability expenses and benefits for each Current Business Employee with
respect to claims incurred by such employee or their covered dependents prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) expenses and benefits with respect to claims
incurred by Current Business Employees or their covered dependents on and
after the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser. For
purposes of this Section 6.12, (a) a claim for medical benefits is incurred
on the date the relevant medical services are provided, (b) a claim for life
insurance benefits is incurred on the date of death, (c) a claim for short-
term disability benefits is incurred on the date the employee becomes
eligible for short-term disability benefits and (d) a claim for long-term
disability benefits is incurred on the date the employee becomes eligible for
short-term disability benefits in connection with the condition resulting in
such employee\'s long-term disability.   Article VII   TAX MATTERS  
SECTION 7.01. Tax Indemnities. (a) The Seller shall indemnify and hold the
Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries harmless against Indemnified
Taxes (and associated expenses). The Purchaser shall be responsible for and
shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless against all
Taxes relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries (and associated
expenses) other than Indemnified Taxes.   (b) In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that
is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall be:   (i) in the case of income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes 
and other Taxes that are readily apportionable based on an actual or  deemed
closing of the books that are deemed to equal the amount which  would be
payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date; and   -36-    (ii)
in the case of all other Taxes, deemed to be the amount  of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of  the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of  which is the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period.   (c) Payment by the indemnifying party
of any amount under this Section 7.01 shall be made within 30 days following
written notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority is due, provided that the Purchaser shall comply
with its obligation to promptly notify the Seller under Section 7.03(a) and
provided further that the indemnifying party shall not be required to make
any payment earlier than two days before it is due to the appropriate taxing
authority. If the Seller receives an assessment or other notice of Taxes due
with respect to the Company and any Subsidiary for any taxable period (or
portion of any taxable period) ending on or before the Closing Date for which
the Seller is not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to this
Agreement, then the Purchaser shall pay such Taxes and the Seller shall pay
to the Purchaser the portion of such Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible, or if the Seller pays such Taxes, then the Purchaser, the
Company or any Subsidiary shall pay to the Seller the amount of such Taxes
for which the Seller is not responsible within five days following such
payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate
taxing authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a
final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing
authority or court.   SECTION 7.02. Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits. (a) Any
Tax refund or credit attributable to the Company or any Subsidiary (including
any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) relating to taxable
periods (or portions of Straddle Periods) ending on or before the Closing
Date shall be the property of the Seller and, if received by the Purchaser,
the Company or any Subsidiary, shall be paid over promptly to the Seller. The
Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller\'s expense,
cause the Company or other relevant entity to file for and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the
Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall permit the
Seller to participate in (at the Seller\'s expense) the prosecution of any
such refund claim.   (b) Any amount otherwise payable by the Seller under
Section 7.01 shall be reduced by any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary arising in
connection with any underlying adjustment resulting in the obligation of the
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary to pay Taxes or
other amounts for which the Seller is responsible under Section 7.01 or the
accrual, incurrence or payment of such Taxes. The Purchaser, its Affiliates,
the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a
Tax benefit to the extent that the Purchaser and the Seller, acting
reasonably and in good faith, determine that the amount of Taxes payable over
time (as determined on a present value basis in the taxable year in which
such indemnity payment is being made using a discount rate of 5%) by such
indemnified party is reduced below the amount of Taxes that such indemnified
party would be required to pay but for the incurrence or payment of such
indemnified amount.   SECTION 7.03. Contests. (a) After the Closing, the
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of the proposed
assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or    
-37-   administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on
the Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary which, if
determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be
grounds for indemnification by the Seller under Section 7.01. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability. If the Purchaser fails to give the Seller prompt
notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 7.03, then
the Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify for any loss arising
out of such asserted Tax liability, but only to the extent that failure to
give such notice results in a detriment to the Seller.   (b) In the case of
a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a "Contest") that
relates to taxable periods ending on or before the date of the Closing, the
Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct of
such Contest, provided that, with respect to Contests that relate solely to
the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Seller may not settle or compromise any
asserted liability that would materially adversely affect the liability for
Taxes of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(a) without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Seller may elect
to direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Contest
involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be
sought from the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01. If the Seller elects to
direct a Contest, the Seller shall within 90 calendar days of receipt of the
notice of asserted Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so,
and the Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to fully cooperate, at the Seller\'s expense, in each phase of
such Contest; provided, that the Purchaser may participate at its own
expense, in the Contest and, provided, further, that the Seller may not
settle or compromise any asserted liability that would adversely affect the
liability for Taxes of the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(a) without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, the Purchaser, the
Company or any Subsidiary may assume control of such Contest (at the
Purchaser\'s own expense). However, in such case, none of the Purchaser, the
Company or any Subsidiary may settle or compromise any asserted liability
without prior written consent of the Seller; provided, however, that consent
to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event,
the Seller may participate, at its own expense, in the Contest.   (d) The
Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees to
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the defense against
or compromise of any claim in any Contest.   SECTION 7.04. Preparation of
Tax Returns. (a) Except as provided in Section 7.04(b), the Seller shall
prepare and file (or cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to prepare and
file) all Tax Returns relating to the Company and each Subsidiary for taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. With respect to such Tax
Returns that are final Income Tax Returns and that relate solely to the
Company and the Subsidiaries, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser and its
authorized representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return at least
30 days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of
such Tax Return, and the     -38-   Purchaser and its authorized
representative shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return
prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to
consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a
result of the review of such Tax Return by the Purchaser or its authorized
representative.   (b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate
to the Company for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date (including
Straddle Periods); it being understood that all Taxes shown as due and
payable on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser,
subject to the Purchaser\'s right of indemnification from the Seller for
Taxes which are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01.
Tax Returns for Straddle Periods shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any
item is required by applicable Law. With respect to any Tax Return required
to be filed with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing
Date and as to which Taxes are allocable to the Seller under Section 7.01
hereof, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its authorized
representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement (with
which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and information)
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to
the Seller pursuant to Section 7.01 at least 30 days prior to the due date
(including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return, and the
Seller and its authorized representative shall have the right to review and
comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of such Tax
Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such Tax
Return and statement by the Seller or its authorized representative.  
SECTION 7.05. Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies
of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work
papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. The Seller and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this
Section 7.05. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each
of the Seller and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Company or any
Subsidiary for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time,
before the Seller or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be
given an opportunity, after 90 days\' prior written notice, to remove and
retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at
such other party\'s expense). Any information obtained under this Section
7.05 shall be     -39-   kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund
or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.   SECTION 7.06. Conveyance
Taxes. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each be liable for, and agree to
pay one-half of, any and all Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or
payable or collectible or incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
cooperate in the execution and delivery of all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable the Purchaser to comply with any pre-Closing filing
requirements.   SECTION 7.07. Tax Covenants. (a) Neither the Purchaser nor
any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend, refile or otherwise modify, or
cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary to amend, refile or otherwise
modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any taxable period (or
portion of any taxable period) ending on or before the Closing Date without
the prior written consent of the Seller.   (b) The Purchaser, the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall make any and all elections under Section 172(b)(3)
of the Code (and under any comparable provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Law) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to the Tax
attributes (including any net operating loss) attributable to the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to any taxable period (or any portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date (including the Straddle Periods) that could be
carried back to any taxable period (or any portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, neither the Seller nor its Affiliates shall be required to
pay to the Purchaser any refund or credit of Taxes that results from the
carryback to any taxable period (or any portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date of any net operating loss, capital loss or Tax credit
attributable to the Company or any Subsidiary in any taxable period (or any
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date (including the Straddle
Periods).   SECTION 7.08. Miscellaneous. (a) For Tax purposes, the
parties agree to treat all payments made under this Article VII and for
any misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or covenants, as adjustments
to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions.   (b) This Article VII
shall be the sole provision governing indemnities for Taxes under this
Agreement.   (c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to
the Purchaser, the Seller, Affiliates, the Company and any Subsidiary
include successors.   (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained
in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force
until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for the Taxes
in question (taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof).   (e)
Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries), on the one hand,
and the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall have been
terminated, and all payments thereunder     -40-   settled, immediately
prior to the Closing with no payments permitted to be made thereunder on and
after the Closing Date.   (f) Payments by the Seller under this Article VII
shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
recoverable by the Purchaser, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any
Affiliates of the Purchaser from any third party with respect thereto.  
SECTION 7.09. Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Upon the Purchaser\'s written
request, the Seller shall join with the Purchaser in elections to have the
provisions of Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and similar provisions of state
or local income Tax law (where permissible) (the "Section 338(h)(10)
Elections") apply to the Purchaser\'s acquisition of the Shares, and the
Purchaser\'s deemed acquisition of the stock of those Subsidiaries
designated by the Purchaser which are U.S. corporations wholly-owned by the
Company or any Subsidiary; provided that Section 338(h)(10) Elections shall
not be made with respect to the Purchaser\'s deemed acquisition of the stock
of Dialysis Holdings, Inc. ("DHI") or the deemed acquisition of the stock of
any corporation wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by DHI; and provided
further, that the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller (on or before the date
on which the applicable IRS Forms 8023 (Elections Under Section 338 for
Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases) are filed) for any additional
Taxes incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates which would not have been
incurred had the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser occurred pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement but no Section 338(h)(10) Elections had been
made.   Article VIII   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   SECTION 8.01. Conditions

and  warranties are made as of a particular date, in which case such 
representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such  date,
except where the failure of such representations and warranties  in the

(ii) the covenants and agreements contained in this  Agreement to be complied
with by the Seller at or before the Closing  shall have been complied with in
all material respects and (iii) the  Purchaser shall have received a

parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until
the date that is 18 months following the Closing, except for (a) the
representations and warranties in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.05, 3.21 and
4.01, which shall survive indefinitely and (b) the representations and
warranties in Section 3.17, which shall survive until the Closing and
thereafter shall have no further force and effect; provided, however, that
any claim made with reasonable specificity by the party seeking to be
indemnified within the time periods set forth in this Section 9.01
shall survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved.   SECTION
9.02. Indemnification by the Seller. The Purchaser and its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a
"Purchaser Indemnified Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Seller from and against all losses, damages, claims, costs and
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable
attorneys\' and consultants\' fees and expenses) actually suffered or
incurred by them (hereinafter, a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:
(a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained
in this Agreement or any certificates delivered in connection herewith
without giving any effect to the terms "material", "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" or terms of similar meaning,     -43-   (b) the breach
of any covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in this Agreement or any

shall be limited to monetary damages pursuant to any settlement or judgment
in the Gallen Litigation and defense costs.   SECTION 9.03. Indemnification
by the Purchaser. The Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Indemnified
Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser from and

of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement or any certificates delivered in connection herewith without giving
any effect to the terms "material", "materiality" or terms of similar
meaning; (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any certificates delivered in

arising before or after the Closing against any Seller Indemnified Party from
the operations of the Company or any Subsidiary (including in respect of any
Action), except for claims or causes of action with respect to which the
Seller is obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant
to Section 9.02.   SECTION 9.04. Limits on Indemnification. (a) No claim may
be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against either party for breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein,
unless written notice of such claim or action is received by such party
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which
the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or
Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01, irrespective
of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred
before or after such date.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement: (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a), unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $30,500,000 after which the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for all Losses in excess of such
amount; (ii) no Losses may be claimed under Section 9.02(a) by any
Indemnified Party or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses
set forth in clause (i) above other than Losses in excess of $100,000
resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same
or substantially similar facts, events or circumstances; (iii) the maximum
amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying
Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section
9.02(a) shall be an amount equal to $534,000,000; and (iv) neither
party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential,
special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, or
loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged
breach of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; provided, however, that
the limits set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to (x)
any indemnifiable Losses arising out of the breach of the representations
and warranties in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.20, 3.21 and 4.01, (y) any
actions, omissions, facts and circumstances occurring prior to the Closing
Date which are violations of any of the obligations of the Company and its
Affiliates contained in the Settlement Agreements or (z) any indemnifiable
Losses arising out of the Retained Claims; provided, further, that the Seller
shall be liable for only 50% of the monetary damages and defense costs
arising out of the Gallen Litigation, but in no event shall the Seller be
liable for any amount in excess of $5,000,000 with respect to the Gallen
Litigation.   (c) For all purposes of this Article IX, "Losses" shall be
net of (i) any insurance or other recoveries payable to the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification, (ii) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or
payment of any such Losses and (iii) any amounts reserved on the Interim
Balance Sheet with respect to such Loss. The Purchaser, its Affiliates, the
Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a Tax
benefit to the extent that the Purchaser and the Seller, acting
reasonably     -44-   and in good faith, determine that the amount of
Taxes payable over time (as determined on a present value basis in the
taxable year in which such indemnity payment is being made using a discount
rate of 5%) by such indemnified party is reduced below the amount of Taxes
that such indemnified party would be required to pay but for the incurrence
or payment of such indemnified amount.   SECTION 9.05. Notice of Loss; Third
Party Claims. (a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 30
days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and
method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions
of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is
claimed or arises.   (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of
any Action, audit, claim, demand or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim")
against it which may give rise to a claim for Loss under this Article IX,
within 30 days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within 30 days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a Third
Party Claim the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the
Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be
paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party
consents in writing to such payment or unless a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered
against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party assumes the defense of any such claims or proceeding pursuant to this
Section 9.05 and proposes to settle such claims or proceeding prior to a
final judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the
settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding;
provided, however, the Seller shall have the sole right to conduct and
otherwise control any of the Retained Claims (including the settlement
thereof) (other than the Gallen Litigation, which shall be controlled by the
Purchaser) provided that any settlement thereof shall include the payment of
money only and shall not include any admission of liability or any other non-
monetary obligations on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Seller in the case of the Gallen Litigation.   SECTION 9.06. Tax
Matters. Anything in this Article IX to the contrary notwithstanding, the
rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any
and all Tax matters shall be solely governed by Article VII and shall not be
subject to the provisions of this Article IX.    -45-    Article X  
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 10.01. Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:   (a) by
either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall  not have occurred
prior to the first anniversary of the date hereof  (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that the right to  terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(a) shall not be  available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under  this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in,  the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date;   (b) by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that 
any Governmental Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final  and
nonappealable;   (c) by the Seller if the Purchaser shall have breached or 
failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, 
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement  which
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a  condition
set forth in Section 8.01(a) and either (i) has not been  cured within 20
days after notice of such breach or failure to perform  has been delivered to
the Purchaser or (ii) is incapable of being cured  prior to the Termination
Date (other than as a result of the Seller\'s  failure to perform the
agreements set forth herein required to be  performed by the Seller);   (d)
by the Purchaser if the Seller shall have breached or  failed to perform in
any material respect any of its representations,  warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in the Agreement  which breach or failure to
perform would give rise to the failure of a  condition set forth in Section
8.02(a) and either (i) has not been  cured within 20 days after notice of
such breach or failure to perform  has been delivered to the Seller or (ii)
is incapable of being cured  prior to the Termination Date (other than as a
result of the  Purchaser\'s failure to perform the agreements set forth
herein required  to be performed by it); or   (e) by the mutual written
consent of Parent, the Seller and  the Purchaser.   SECTION 10.02. Effect
of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 10.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability on the part of either party hereto except (a) that the last
sentence of Section 5.03(a), this Section 10.02 and Article XI shall survive
any such termination and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve either party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination.    -46-    Article XI   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION

Announcements. No party to this Agreement shall make, or cause to be made,
any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise communicate with any
news media without the prior written consent of the other parties, unless
otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, or is
otherwise consistent with such party\'s prior communication practices with
investors, analysts and the like (so long as the substance of such
communications with investors, analysts and the like is not inconsistent with
other prior communications, press releases or other announcements made
pursuant to this Section 11.03), and the parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public
announcement or communication.   SECTION 11.04. Severability. If any term or
other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as
the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   SECTION 11.05. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality

to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.   SECTION 11.06.
Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser
(which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the
Seller or the Purchaser),     -48-   as the case may be; provided,
however, the Purchaser shall have the right to assign this Agreement to (i) a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser or (ii) any
lender or lenders providing financing for the transactions contemplated
hereby for collateral security purposes; provided, further, however, that any
such assignment shall not relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder.   SECTION 11.07. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf
of, each of the Seller and the Purchaser or (b) by a waiver in accordance
with Section 11.08.   SECTION 11.08. Waiver. Any party to this Agreement
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered by any other party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements of any other party or conditions to such party\'s
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound
thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The
failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of any of such rights.   SECTION 11.09. No Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and except for the provisions of Article IX relating to indemnified

upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
