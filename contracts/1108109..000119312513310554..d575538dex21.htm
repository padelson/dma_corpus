2013, by and among Health Management Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Community Health Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and FWCT-2 Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ "), the board
of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and the board of
directors of Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the Merger; 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified in this
Agreement in connection with the Merger and to prescribe various conditions to
the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, as of or prior to the Closing, Parent and a trustee mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " _Trustee_ ") will enter into a
Contingent Value Rights Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _CVR Agreement_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I __

 

 _The Merger_

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Company_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP at 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, 10022 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the third
(3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between the Company and Parent. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, if the
Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall take place instead on the earlier
to occur of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing Period to be  specified by Parent to the Company on no less than three (3) Business Days
written notice to the Company and (b) the last day of the Marketing Period,
but in each case subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

 

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, and at or prior to the Closing Date, shall
make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the
Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

Section 1.04. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. At the Effective
Time, (i) the Company Charter shall be amended in the Merger to be the same
as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Company
shall be "Health Management Associates, Inc.") and until thereafter further
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by the DGCL, shall be the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company,
and (ii) the Company By-laws shall be amended in the Merger to read as the
by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "Health Management
Associates, Inc."), and as so amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Company until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided
by the DGCL or in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-
laws of the Surviving Company.

 

Section 1.05. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of
capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01,

2 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock
Owned by Company Subsidiaries_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub
shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Company such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the
Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the
ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.02_ and
_Section 2.03_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled or
converted into shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with _Section
2.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and
converted into the right to receive (i) 0.06942 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the "
_Stock Consideration_ "), (ii) $10.50 per share in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), and (iii) one contingent value right (a " _CVR_ ") issued
by Parent subject to and in accordance with the CVR Agreement (the " _CVR
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration and the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to holder thereof,
without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of
Taxes. Each CVR issued as CVR Consideration hereunder will be substantially in
the form attached as Annex A to the CVR Agreement (the " _CVR Certificate_ ").
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or
other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.02(d)_, without interest
and subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then the Exchange Ratio will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company Deferred Stock Awards and other
awards under the Company Stock Plans the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that with respect to
outstanding Company Stock Options and other awards made under the Company
Stock Plans, any such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the
applicable Company Stock Plan.

 



3 (d) _Company Convertible Notes_. The Company Convertible Notes issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding unless converted prior to the Effective Time, and shall be treated
in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such Company
Convertible Notes following the Effective Time; provided, however, that upon
the request of Parent, the Company shall cause the Company Convertible Notes
to be settled for an amount in cash calculated in accordance with the terms of
the indenture governing the Company Convertible Notes. Parent shall provide
or cause to be provided all funds necessary to pay any such settlement of the
Company Convertible Notes.

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_
through the Exchange Agent, in trust with the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration (or
appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent
if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued), (ii) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to  _Section 2.02(f)_, and (iii) CVR Certificates representing the
aggregate number of CVRs issuable pursuant to the CVR Agreement (all such
Parent Common Stock, cash and CVR Certificates deposited with the Exchange
Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time a
form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may specify, subject to the Companys approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and shall be prepared prior to
the Closing), together with instructions thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate,
the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completely and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x)

 



4  the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and (y) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.02(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares that the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.02(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or
other distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.02(d)_) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is
held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c)_,
each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto,
shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock are entitled to receive in
respect of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 2.02(f)_ and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.02(d))_. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment with respect to the Cash Consideration or in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of
such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form)
in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to escheat, Tax or other
Applicable Law, following surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder
of the Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.02(f)_ and (ii) the amount of dividends or
other distributions declared on the shares of Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such
surrender that is payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock and CVR Certificates issued and cash paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ , upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_ or 
_Section 2.02(f)_), shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form) are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



5 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.01_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
amount multiplied by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on
the NYSE on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common
Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company (subject to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law) for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.02(d)_, in each case without any interest thereon.

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent, or any of their respective Representatives, shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property
of, Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange
Fund shall diminish the rights of any stockholder of the Company to receive
the Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the
extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms
hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company
and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company
Deferred Stock Awards and/or Company Performance Cash Awards pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable tax law. Amounts so
withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. 

 



6 (k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the Stock
Consideration and pay the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares and any dividends and distributions on such Certificate, in each case
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.03. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are
entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.01(c)_, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any holder of Company
Common Stock fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his, her
or its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other Applicable
Law, then any such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_ without interest or dividends thereon, less
any applicable withholding of Taxes. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or
as otherwise required by an Order, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.04. _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock
Awards, Company Deferred Stock Awards and Company Performance Cash Awards_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering any Company Stock Plan) will take all actions
reasonably requested by Parent to give effect to this _Section
2.04_ (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary
participant consents, determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof). In addition to the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall terminate all equity incentive plans of the Company,
effective not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the
foregoing actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding
the Effective Time.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option that is then outstanding (whether vested or
unvested) that has not been exercised as of the Effective Time shall cease to
be exercisable and shall be cancelled and, in consideration for such
cancellation, each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from 

 



7  the Surviving Company that number of whole and fractional shares of Company
Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time minus
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option which, when multiplied by the per share closing price of Company
Common Stock as reported on the NYSE the day before the Effective Time, is
equal to the aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option. Any such
whole shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
_Section 2.01(c)_) and any Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto
shall be paid out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section 2.02_
(less applicable withholding taxes, if any). An amount equal to the value of
any such fractional shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid by the
Company to the holder in cash as promptly as practicable after Closing based
on the Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the applicable Company
Stock Plan) of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that the per share exercise price of any Company Stock
Option is equal to or is greater than the per share closing price of Company
Common Stock as reported on the NYSE the day before the Effective Time, such
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without payment therefor and shall
have no further force or effect.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to a
Company Restricted Stock Award that is then outstanding (whether vested or
unvested) shall vest in full (assuming, in the case of Company Restricted
Stock Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting, that the
performance goals are satisfied at a level of 100%) and, at the Effective
Time, shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for
purposes of _Section 2.01(c)_. Any Merger Consideration payable with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards
shall be paid out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section 2.02_
(less applicable withholding taxes, if any) and, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, any Merger Consideration payable with respect to shares
of Company Common Stock subject to Company Restricted Stock Awards granted
pursuant to the 2006 Outside Director Restricted Stock Award Plan shall be
paid in cash as required by the terms of such plan or the award agreements
issued thereunder.

(c) _Treatment of Company Deferred Stock Awards_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each Company Deferred Stock Award that is then
outstanding (whether vested or unvested) shall vest in full (assuming, in the
case of Company Deferred Stock Awards that are subject to performance-based
vesting, that the performance goals are satisfied at a level of 100%) and
shall be cancelled and, in consideration for such cancellation, each holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Company that number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Deferred Stock Award so
cancelled and, at the Effective Time, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes
of _Section 2.01(c)_. Any Merger Consideration payable with respect to
Company Deferred Stock Awards shall be paid out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with _Section 2.02_ (less applicable withholding taxes, if any).
Any dividend equivalent distributions that are accrued pursuant to the terms
of any Company Deferred Stock Award that are unpaid as of the Effective Time
shall be paid in cash, without interest, by the Company to the holder thereof
as promptly as practicable after Closing.

 



8 (d) _Treatment of Company Performance Cash Awards_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Performance Cash Award that is then outstanding
(whether vested or unvested) shall vest in full and shall be cancelled in
exchange for a lump sum cash payment determined as if the applicable
performance objectives had been achieved at a level of 100%, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(e) _Taxes_. The Company shall withhold from the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise deliverable to each applicable participant in the Company
Stock Plans pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ a number of shares of Company
Common Stock having a value, determined based on the value of the Merger
Consideration as of the Closing, equal to the amount of Taxes that is required
to be withheld in respect of the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.04_. The Company shall withhold from the cash amount otherwise deliverable
to each applicable participant in the Company Stock Plans pursuant to _Section
2.04(d)_ a cash amount having a value equal to the amount of Taxes that is
required to be withheld in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.04_.

ARTICLE III __

 

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except (i) as disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents or any other report, schedule, form, statement,
prospectus or other document (in each case excluding exhibits and schedules
thereto and other information incorporated therein) filed with, or furnished
to, the SEC after January 1, 2012 and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement (other than any risk factor disclosures contained in the "Risk
Factors" section thereof, or other cautionary or predictive statements
therein) or (ii) in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent
at or before the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the
" _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to
which it corresponds and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other section or subsection):

 

Section 3.01. _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is
a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each

 



9  jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or
licensing necessary, except in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
where the failure to be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. A true, correct and complete list of all the Subsidiaries of the
Company, identifying (i) the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, and type of entity of each such Subsidiary, (ii) the number and
type of the outstanding share capital or other equity or similar interests of
each such Subsidiary, (iii) the percentage of the outstanding share capital or
other equity or similar interests of each such Subsidiary owned by the Company
and each of its other Subsidiaries and (iv) the percentage of the outstanding
share capital or other equity or similar interests of each such Subsidiary
owned by any other Person in each such Subsidiary, is set forth on _Section
3.01(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent, prior to execution
of this Agreement, true, correct and complete copies of (i) the restated
certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ "), and (ii) the amended and restated by-
laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company By-laws_ ").

Section 3.02. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by holders of not
less than seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof (provided that at least a majority in voting power of
the shares of Company Common Stock are represented in person or by proxy at
such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof) (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The Company Board has by resolutions duly
adopted (i) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, (ii) determined that entering into this Agreement and consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) declared this Agreement
advisable, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and, subject to
_Section 5.02_, such resolutions have not been withdrawn, amended or
modified. The Company Board has directed that the Company submit the adoption
of this Agreement to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ "). Except for the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize or adopt
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL). The Company has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

 



10 (b) The Company Board has taken all actions necessary to (a) render the
Company Rights Plan inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) ensure that (i) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Subsidiary of Parent is an Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in
the Company Rights Plan) pursuant to the Company Rights Plan solely as a
result of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii)
a "Distribution Date" or a "Stock Acquisition Date" (as such terms are defined
in the Company Rights Plan) does not occur, in each case, as a result of the
adoption, approval, execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger Agreement and (iii) the "Final Expiration Date" (as
defined in the Company Rights Plan) shall be extended to the earlier of May
24, 2014 or immediately prior to the Effective Time. Assuming the
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 4.16_ is true and correct,
the Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.
No "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation (collectively, "
_Takeover Laws_ ") applies with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.03. _Capital Structure_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 750,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company
Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company
Capital Stock_ "). At the close of business on July 26, 2013 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 260,214,660 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding, (iii) 9,605,006 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved

issuable upon the vesting or settlement of outstanding Company Restricted
Stock Awards, and (C) 7,314,918 shares were potentially issuable upon the
vesting or settlement of outstanding Company Deferred Stock Awards, and (iv)
1,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock have been designated as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_ ") and
have been reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the rights distributed to
the Company stockholders pursuant to the Company Rights Plan. Section 3.03(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all issued and outstanding Company
Performance Cash Awards granted under the Company Stock Plans.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.03(a)_ and this _Section 3.03(b)_, and
other than the Companys 3.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2028
(the " _Company Convertible Notes_ "), as of the Capitalization Date, there
were (i) no outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, (iii)
no outstanding options, warrants, convertible debt, rights, interests or other
commitments or agreements relating to any right (contingent or otherwise) to
acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or relating to any
obligation (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to issue or sell, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting

 



11  interests in, the Company, (iv) no obligations (contingent or otherwise) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, option, warrant, convertible debt, right, interest, convertible
or exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to
any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company and
(v) no other obligations (contingent or otherwise) by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any of
the foregoing or dividends paid thereon (the items in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v) being referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_
").

(c) Other than the indenture governing the Company Convertible Notes, there
are no outstanding agreements of any kind that relate to any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i)
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities (except
pursuant to the acquisition by the Company of shares of Company Common Stock
in settlement of the exercise price of Company Stock Options, or for purposes
of satisfying Tax withholding obligations with respect to holders of Company

(a) Parent has publicly filed with or publicly furnished to the SEC on a

other documents required to be filed with the SEC by Parent since January 1,

incorporated therein (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Parent SEC Documents that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other
Parent SEC Documents), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates (and, if amended prior to
the date hereof, as of the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect
to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent (including the related
notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents

Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Parent and
the Subsidiaries of Parent, taken as a whole).

(c) Parent has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting and accounting sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes. Parent has designed and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that material information that is required to be disclosed by Parent
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No significant deficiency,

a true, correct and complete copy of an executed commitment letter among
Parent and those financial institutions party to the Commitment Letter
(together with their permitted assignees under the Commitment Letter, the "

funding of the full amount of the debt facilities contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) other

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Recommendation_.

(a) _No Solicitation_. Except as expressly permitted by this  _Section
5.02_, from the execution and delivery of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, (i) solicit, seek, initiate or knowingly

(including Section 203 of the DGCL), or the Company Rights Plan, or otherwise
fail to enforce any of the foregoing (provided that the Company shall not be
prohibited from taking the actions set forth in this clause (v) if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law), or
(vi) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations with any
Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall (x)
request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy, in each case pursuant to the terms of such confidentiality agreement,
all confidential information furnished to any such Person by or on behalf of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives and
(y) terminate the access of any Persons (other than Parent, its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective Representatives) to any "data room" hosted by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives relating
to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) _Discussions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
5.02(a)_ or any other provision hereof, if (i) at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives
receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons,
which Acquisition Proposal did not result from any material breach of this
_Section 5.02_, and (ii) in the case of the following clauses (B) and (C),
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company
and its Representatives may (A) contact the Person or group of Persons who
has made such Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify terms for the sole
purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal,
(B) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) provide or make available to Parent all information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available
to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or
its Representatives and (C) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(c) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than 48 hours after receipt) notify Parent if any proposal or
offer with respect to any Acquisition Proposal is received by, any non-public
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives, including the identity of the
Person making the proposal, offer, request or inquiry and the material terms
and conditions of any such proposal or offer and copies of all relevant
documents relating thereto (including copies of any

 



44  written proposals, indications of interest, draft agreements and any other
written materials to the extent such materials contain any financial terms,
conditions or other terms relating to such proposal or offer). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status of
(including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) any such proposal, offer, request or inquiry
(including by promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt)
providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals,
indications of interest, draft agreements and any other written materials to
the extent such materials contain any financial terms, conditions or other
terms relating to such proposal or offer). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.02_.

(d)  _No Company Adverse Recommendation Change_. Except as expressly set
forth in _Section 5.02(e)_ or _Section 5.02(f)_, the Company Board shall not
(i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent (or publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) following either (A) the
public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal or (B) a public statement made
by one or more directors of the Company that is inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in the
case of clause (A), within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in
writing and, in the case of clause (B) within ten (10) Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing; provided that in no event shall Parent make
more than two (2) requests, in the aggregate, under this clause (iii), (iv)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, (v) if a tender offer or
exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company
(including, for these purposes, by disclosing that it is taking no position
with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
shareholders, which, subject to _Section 5.02(g)_, shall constitute a failure
to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer),
within ten (10) Business Days after commencement, or (vi) resolve or agree to
do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) _Superior Proposals_. At any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, if the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is not
withdrawn, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from any material breach
of this _Section 5.02_, that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (i) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) authorize the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Board may only take
the actions described in (x) clause (ii) if the Company has paid the
Termination Fee in compliance with _Section 8.03(b)(i)_ and (y) clauses (i)
or (ii) if:

(1) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law;

 



45 (2) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of the
Company Boards intention to take such action at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify the material
terms of the Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement with, and the identity of, the Person making
the Superior Proposal, and copies of any other written materials to the extent
such materials contain any financial terms, conditions or other terms relating
to such Superior Proposal; 

(3) after providing such notice and prior to taking any such action, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during
such three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to take
such action; and

(4) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by
5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on the third (3rd) Business Day of such three
(3) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and that failure to take such action would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, if
such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect.

In the event that a Superior Proposal is modified by the Person making such
proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent of such modified Superior Proposal pursuant to clause (B) of this
_Section 5.02(e)_ at least two (2) Business Days in advance of taking any
action described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 5.02(e)_ and shall
again comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to
any such modified Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after
compliance with the foregoing clause (B) and (C) with respect to any three
Superior Proposals (including any modification pursuant to the prior
sentence), the Company shall have no further obligation in the future to
comply with the notification and negotiation obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to any Superior Proposal or modification to a
Superior Proposal made by any Person.

 

(f) _Intervening Events_. Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal
(which shall be subject to _Section 5.02(e)_ and shall not be subject to
this _Section 5.02(f)_), at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company Board may take any action prohibited by clauses (i) or
(ii) of _Section 5.02(d)_ (an " _Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ "
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) only in response to an Intervening Event and only if:

 

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that failure to
effect an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

 



46 (ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of the Company
Boards intention to take such action at least three (3)Business Days in
advance of effecting an Intervening Event Recommendation Change, which notice
shall specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

 

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting an Intervening Event
Recommendation Change, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect the Intervening Event Recommendation Change; and

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent
by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on the third (3rd) Business Day of such three
(3) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would continue to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law if
such changes offered by Parent were to be given effect.

In the event that any material change to the facts and circumstances relating
to the Intervening Event that is the subject of this _Section 5.02(f)_ shall
occur, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
of such modified Intervening Event pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section
5.02(f)_ at least two (2) Business Days in advance of effecting an Intervening
Event Recommendation Change and shall again comply with the provisions of this
_Section 5.02(f)_ with respect any such modified Intervening Event.

(g) _Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that if any such
communication or disclosure would otherwise constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.02(d)_, nothing in this _Section
5.02(g)_ shall operate to prevent any such communication or disclosure from
constituting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. For the avoidance of
doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto (without including such a reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation) shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(h) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
or its Subsidiaries Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a breach of this  _Section 5.02_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.02_.

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person or
group of Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub) providing for (a) any
acquisition or purchase of (1) 15% or more (based on the fair market value,

the Companys Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (2) shares or other equity securities of the Company which together
with any other shares or other equity securities of the Company beneficially
owned by such Person or group of Persons, would equal 15% or more of
aggregate voting power of the Company, (b) any tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group of Persons owning,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the

Company pursuant to which, in each case, any Person or group of Persons (or

surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity, or (d) any combination of the foregoing, in
the case of any of clauses (a) through (d), whether in a single transaction or
a series or related transactions and whether directly or indirectly, other
than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

or occurrence arising after the date hereof that (i) was neither known to the
Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof and

the price of Parent Common Stock (except that the underlying cause of any
such change in the price of Parent Common Stock (to the extent otherwise
falling within the definition of "Intervening Event") may constitute or
contribute towards an Intervening Event), (C) the Required Antitrust
Approvals, (D) any event, change, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence generally affecting the non-urban hospital services industry,
except to the extent such event, change, development or occurrence has a
disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as compared to other participants in the
non-urban hospital services industry or (E) the fact that, in and of itself,
there has been a change in the composition of the Company Board.

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with all references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition

any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, (y) if consummated, would be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Merger and (z) the financing of which is reasonably expected to
be obtained, in each case, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory, timing and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any fees to be paid by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.03)_.

 



48 Section 5.03. _Certain Matters Relating to Change of Control Provisions_. 

(a) _Indebtedness_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall obtain an appropriate waiver or amendment under the Credit
Agreement such that no "Change of Control" shall occur thereunder as a result

control, event of default or similar event shall have occurred under the
Credit Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent any acceleration of any principal or interest amount under the Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from occurring or continuing; provided, that in no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make any payments in connection with
any of the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.03(a)_ that are,
individually or in the aggregate, in excess of the amount set forth on
_Section 5.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) _Company Stock Plans_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate

under any of the Company Stock Plans, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent any increase in the aggregate amount of cash
payments otherwise payable under the Company Stock Plans as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in excess of
the amount set forth on  _Section 5.03(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

ARTICLE VI __

 

 _Additional Agreements_

Section 6.01. _Preparation and Mailing of the Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the stockholders of
the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, and
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (ii) Parent
shall prepare and file the Form S-4, and (iii) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, if required by Applicable Law, have the CVR Agreement become
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. The Proxy Statement will be included
in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4. Parent and the Company shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 cleared by
the SEC and declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and to have the S-4 remain effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall make the Company
Recommendation to the Companys stockholders and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the
other, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by
such other party to be included therein and shall otherwise assist and
cooperate with the other in the preparation of

 



49  the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 and the resolution of any comments to
either received from the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 if and to the extent such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company and Parent
shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC
and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 and shall supply the other with copies of all
written correspondence between such party or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4. The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of
any such comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any dissemination of the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments
from the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall
provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response, which the party receiving such comments
shall consider in good faith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall take all necessary actions in accordance with Applicable Law, the
Company Charter, the Company By-laws and the rules of NYSE to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and the Form S-4 is declared effective.
Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time
in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if, as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth

legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and
agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters
and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing
of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any
way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this
Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to Closing to be

 



52  satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions

consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any Action brought by a
third party that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of each of clauses (i) through
(iv), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations relating to Regulatory Laws, which are the subject of  _Section
6.03(c)_ and _Section 6.03(d)_.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and refrain from taking any
actions that would cause the applicability of such Takeover Laws and (ii) if
the restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to
ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable following the date hereof,
(ii) supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other applicable Regulatory Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken
all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Regulatory Laws and to obtain all consents under any Regulatory Laws that may
be required by the FTC, DOJ or any Governmental Entity with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto shall take or cause to be taken
all actions necessary to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Regulatory Law, including (A) defending any Action challenging this Agreement

with any Governmental Entity or with any other person, (C) selling,
divesting, conveying or holding separate or otherwise taking any other action
that limits Parents and its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to,
or their ability to retain, particular products,

 



53  assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, or agreeing to take any such action, (D) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Parent or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries and (E) effectuating any other change or
restructuring of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, in
each case, to the extent necessary to obtain all consents that may
be required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Regulatory Laws or to
resolve any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with competent
jurisdiction; provided, however, that Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) shall
not be required to take any action or propose or enter into any divestiture,
hold separate, or other consent order or consent decree or agreement with any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse
to the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
and (ii) may determine, in their sole discretion, to sell, divest or dispose
of certain assets, properties and businesses of Parent (or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) (in lieu of or in combination with selling, divesting or
disposing of certain assets, properties, or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
other Order in any Litigation. Nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall require
the Company or its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing, or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take or agree to any action or other matter
pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ referred to in clauses (B)-(E) above without
Parents prior written consent (which consent shall be granted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence), including that (but without limiting
Parents obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) if any
products, businesses or assets of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries are to be sold, divested or disposed of pursuant to this _Section
6.03_, Parent shall have the right to select the products, businesses and/or
assets to be sold, divested or disposed of.

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Entity by any person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) subject to
Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other parties hereto with respect to
information relating to the other parties hereto and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity, or in any filings or
submissions in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood that certain documents including those submitted under Item 4(c) or
4(d) of the Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act may
be subject to reasonable redactions), and (iv) to the extent practicable and
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
private party, as the case may be, give the other parties hereto the
opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings and conferences.

 



54 Section 6.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and previously provided to Parent, shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law
(including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors)
the Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the "
_Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, regulatory or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In the event of any
such Action, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such Action from the
Surviving Company within ten Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Company
from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Companys certificate of
incorporation or by-laws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter.

 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws to the extent they provide for indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of each Company
Indemnified Party as applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, on the same basis as set forth
in the Company Charter and Company By-laws in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended during such time except as
required by Applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by Applicable
Law that would enlarge the scope of the Company Indemnified Parties
indemnification rights thereunder.

(c) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or 

 



55  surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.04_.

 

(d) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in either case, of not
less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to
the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A"
rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the aggregate
annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is unable
to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.04_ it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year
period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each
policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may, at its option (following reasonable consultation
with Parent), purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its
current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less
than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of any such
tail policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. In
the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Company
shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this 
_Section 6.05(d)_. The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. 

Section 6.05. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



56 Section 6.06. _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will use, and will cause their Affiliates
and their respective Representatives to use, reasonable best efforts to take
(or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, and proper in order to obtain
third party debt financing for the purpose of financing the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the Company Equity Award Consideration, any repayment
or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any offers required under this Agreement to repurchase
outstanding debt upon a change of control or fundamental change and
conversions of the Company Convertible Notes) and any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger
Sub (the " _Financing_ ") (it being understood that the receipt of such
Financing is not a condition to the Merger) on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter (taking into account the anticipated timing
of the Marketing Period), including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto), and on such other terms as Parent and the
Lenders shall agree, (ii) to satisfy all conditions on a timely basis to
obtaining and consummating the Financing applicable to (and within the control
of) it set forth in such definitive agreements, and (iii) maintain in effect
and comply with the Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions set
forth in the Commitment Letter, including as specified in any fee letter),
including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required thereunder. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice
upon becoming aware of, or receiving written notice with respect to, any (x)
material breach of any provision of the Commitment Letter by a party thereto
or (y) unavailability, termination or ineffectiveness of any provision of the
Commitment Letter that would result in an amount being available less than
what is required to consummate the transaction herein. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
any Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces
the aggregate amount of Financing below the amount that would be required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees or original issue
discount contemplated by the Commitment Letter), (B) amends or expands the
conditions to the availability of the Financing, (C) would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay the Closing or (D) would reasonably be expected
to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letter, except, in each such case,
with the prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ , for the avoidance
of doubt, that Parent shall be permitted, without the prior written consent of
the Company, to amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners and syndication agents or similar entities, if the addition of
such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not delay the
availability of the Financing. In the event that any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company thereof, and Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to 

 



57  arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, together with
the remaining Financing and any other sources available to Parent and Merger
Sub, to fund the Financing) from the same or other sources (such portion from
alternate sources, the " _Alternate Financing_ "), so long as such Alternate
Financing does not otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions)
that could reasonably be expected to make the funding of such Alternate
Financing in an amount less than what is required to consummate the
transaction herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the availability nor terms of the Financing (including obtaining any required
consents or waivers from any third party with respect thereto) or any
Alternate Financing are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger, and each of Parent and Merger Sub reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement subject only to the express conditions set forth in Article
VII, irrespective and independently of the availability or terms of the
Financing or any Alternate Financing, Parents or Merger Subs use of efforts
in accordance with this  _Section 6.06(a)_ or otherwise.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to,
provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and
reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the arrangement,
obtainment and syndication of the Financing; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) unreasonably
disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (in the reasonable judgment of the Company), (B) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior
to the Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed or
simultaneously indemnified or (C) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Company Charter, the Company By-
laws, any Applicable Laws, the Credit Agreement or any Material Contract. Such
cooperation shall include, without limitation, (i) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions and
sessions with potential lenders, investors and meetings with ratings agency,
(ii) providing reasonable and timely assistance with the preparation of
customary materials for presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents required in connection with the arranging, obtaining and
syndication of Financing (including requesting the Consent of any
accountants use of their materials in connection with the Financing), (iii)
as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event at least 18 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, furnishing Parent and its financing sources
with all available financial and other information pertinent to the Company
and its Subsidiaries including delivery of (x) unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and related statements of operations and comprehensive income and cash
flows for the Company for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013 and each
subsequent fiscal quarter ended on a date that is not a fiscal year end and
that is at least 45 days before the Closing Date, (y) (in the event that the
Closing Date occurs on a date that is more than 90 days following December
31, 2013) audited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders equity and
cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, in each case prepared
in accordance with GAAP and (z) without duplication of the foregoing clauses
(x) and (y), the information and documents relating

 



58  to the Company required by paragraphs 9 and 10 of Exhibit E to the
Commitment Letter (such information in the foregoing clauses (x), (y) and (z),
the " _Required Information_ "), (iv) providing unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related statements of operations and comprehensive income
and cash flows for the Company, (v) having the Company designate members of
senior management of the Company to execute customary authorization letters
with respect to bank information memoranda, offering memoranda or other
materials provided to prospective lenders or investors and participate in a
reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the
Financing, including reasonable direct contact between such senior management
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the potential lenders in
the Financing, (vi) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and
family ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, (vii) requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with
Parents reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountants comfort
letters (including "negative assurance") and consents from the Companys
independent auditors, (viii) assisting in the preparation of, and executing
and delivering, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and
collateral documents and customary closing certificates as may be required by
the Financing and other customary documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, (ix) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing, (x)
assisting the Financing sources in benefiting from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (xi) requesting from the
Companys existing lenders such customary documents in connection with
refinancings as requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent), lien releases (including UCC-3
termination statements), instruments of termination or discharge, (xii)
furnishing Parent and the Lenders with all documentation and other information
required by Governmental Entities with respect to the Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001,
as amended), and (xiii) otherwise cooperating with Parent, and taking all
other corporate actions, the effectiveness of which shall be subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent reasonably
necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing. Parent shall promptly,
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, but excluding for the
avoidance of doubt, the costs of the Companys preparation of its annual and
quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives contemplated by this _Section 6.06_, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing, the use of proceeds thereof and any information
used in connection therewith, except with respect to any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such persons. The expense
reimbursement and indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
6.06(b) shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 6.06_, the term " _Financing_ " shall also

in lieu of any committed bridge facilities) and the term " _Commitment Letter_
" shall also be deemed to include

_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall be

Section 6.07. _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written
request by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to commence offers to purchase, change of control offers, consent
solicitations and/or other similar actions related to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount and all other amounts due of any or all
series of notes, debentures or other debt securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, that are
specified and requested, from time to time, by Parent (each a " _Debt Tender
Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offers_ ") and Parent shall
assist the Company in connection therewith. Parent shall only request the
Company to conduct any Debt Tender Offer in compliance with the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender Offers shall
be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing (except for any Debt Tender
Offer in which Parent has agreed to make all required payments), and the
parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Tender Offers to close on the Closing Date (or on such earlier date as
aforesaid). Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company shall provide, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Tender Offers, including using reasonable best efforts in assisting
with the preparation of any offer to purchase and letter of transmittal and
any consent solicitation statement. The Company (i) shall waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Tender Offers (other than, if applicable, the
occurrence of the Closing) and make any change to the Debt Tender Offers, in
each case, as may be reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) shall not,
without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender
Offers or make any changes to the Debt Tender Offers. Parent shall ensure that
at the Effective Time the Surviving Company has all funds necessary to pay for
such notes, debentures or other debt securities that have been properly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the pendency nor the
consummation of any Debt Tender Offer is a condition to Parents or Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger.

(b) Any dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary,
paying agent and any other agents retained in connection with the Debt Tender
Offers shall be selected by Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Subject to _Section 6.07(e)_, the Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected and
on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent.

(c) With respect to any series of notes, debentures or other debt securities
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, if requested by Parent in writing on a
timely basis, in lieu of or in addition to commencing a Debt Tender Offer for
such series (or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent
permitted by the applicable documents governing such series of

 



60  securities, (i) issue a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date agreed with Parent (or such later time
as may be required by such indenture, other governing documents or law) for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such securities of such
series pursuant to the requisite provisions of such indenture or other
governing documents or (ii) take any actions reasonably requested by Parent
that are customary or necessary to facilitate the redemption, defeasance,
satisfaction and/or discharge of such series pursuant to the applicable
section of such governing documents, and shall redeem, defease or satisfy
and/or discharge, as applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of
such governing documents at the Effective Time. Any such redemption or
satisfaction and discharge must be conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing and shall only be effectuated if the documents governing such series
of securities permit such conditional redemption. Parent shall ensure that at
the Effective Time the Surviving Company has all funds necessary to pay in
full such redemption or satisfaction and discharge. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the pendency nor the consummation of any
such redemption, defeasance or satisfaction and discharge is a condition to
Parents or Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger.

(d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange for, at the Closing, the termination of the Credit Agreement and
any other existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and the
procurement of customary payoff letters in connection therewith. Parent shall
ensure that at the Effective Time the Surviving Company has all funds
necessary to pay in full the payoff amount for any such indebtedness.

(e) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in
connection with this _Section 6.07_. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section 6.07_.

Section 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the other partys
prior written consent, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system (in which case the party required to
issue such press release or make such statement shall give reasonable notice
to the other party, including the opportunity to review and comment on such
press release or statement to the extent practicable); provided further, that
the Company need not consult Parent in connection with the matters referred to
in and in accordance with _Section 5.02_, including any press release or
public statement to be issued or made in order to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.02_.
The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby following execution of this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company.
Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including the first
sentence of this Section) or as required by Applicable Law, no

 



61  party shall issue any press release or make any public statement regarding
the other party or the other partys operations, directors, officers or
employees without obtaining the other partys prior written consent.

Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (" _Benefit Period_ "), each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who remains in the employment of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") shall receive (i) a base salary and annual cash
incentive opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) that are, at
Parents election, either (A) no lower than the base salary and annual cash
incentive opportunities that were provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) substantially comparable to
the base salary and annual cash incentive opportunities that Parent or its
Subsidiaries then provide to similarly situated employees, (ii) employee
benefits that are, at Parents election, either (A) no less favorable in the
aggregate than the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans set
forth on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or (B)
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits that Parent
or its Subsidiaries then provide to similarly situated employees, and (iii)
severance benefits that are, at Parents election, either (A) no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) substantially comparable to the
severance benefits that Parent or its Subsidiaries then provide to similarly
situated employees. Continuing Employees covered by any Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall receive base salary, cash and equity incentives and employee
benefits consistent with applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements. 

(b) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents will be eligible to participate during and after
the Benefit Period, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits and vesting (other than benefit accruals and early
retirement subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan or any
equity compensation arrangement), service recognized by the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
as service with Parent or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
such service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that the applicable
Company Benefit Plan did not recognize such service for such Continuing
Employee, (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or (iii) with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan for
which prior service is not recognized for employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries generally.

(c) During the Benefit Period, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any group
health plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their spouses and
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate during the Benefit
Period, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan for such
individual immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the
dollar amount of 

 



62  all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Continuing Employee (and his or her spouse and eligible dependents) under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan during the year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which each such
Continuing Employee will be eligible to participate during such year. 

(d) Without otherwise limiting the generality of _Section 9.07_, the
provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the
matters provided for in this _Section 6.09_) under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.09_ shall amend, or
be deemed to amend (or, except as otherwise provided in this _Section
6.09_, prevent the amendment or termination of) any Company Benefit Plan or
any Parent Benefit Plan.

(e) Parent shall have no obligation to continue to employ or retain the
services of any Continuing Employee for any period of time following the
Closing.

Section 6.10. _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries_. Parent
shall cause each of Merger Sub and any other applicable Subsidiary of Parent
to comply with and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this
Agreement, including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to comply with and perform all of its obligations under
or relating to this Agreement.

Section 6.11. _CVR Agreement_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
execute and deliver, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Trustee to execute and deliver, the CVR Agreement, subject to any reasonable
revisions to the CVR Agreement that are required by the Trustee.

 

Section 6.12. _Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
(i) the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the CVRs to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE or NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date; provided, that, in the event the CVRs are
unable to be approved for listing on the NYSE or NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the CVRs to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on, subject to official notice of issuance, any other national
securities exchange, the OTC Markets Group (f/k/a Pink Sheets) or the OTC
Bulletin Board prior to the Closing Date. Each of the parties agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys securities to be de-listed
from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. Parent shall reserve for issuance, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to be approved for listing on the NYSE, such
shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued upon conversion of Company
Convertible Notes, calculated on a fully-diluted basis and after giving
effect to the Merger.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (i) the

to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement
which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.13(a)_
shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of any written

contemplated by this Agreement.

to, involving or affecting this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") is brought or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any
such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
(at Parents sole expense and subject to a joint defense agreement) to
participate in the defense, settlement and/or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its
or their respective Representatives shall settle, agree to settle or come to
any arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 6.15. _Existing Litigation_. From the execution and delivery of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably consult with
Parent (a) at regular intervals regarding the status of the Existing
Litigation and (b) prior to taking any material action with respect to any
Existing Litigation, including but not limited to settling, agreeing to
settle or coming to any arrangement regarding any Existing Litigation.

Section 6.16. _Conversion of Company Convertible Notes_. Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary, in accordance with
state and federal securities laws and the terms of the indenture governing the

shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to

Fee_ ") if:

_Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to
pay the Company Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section 8.03(c)_, and
the payment by the Company of the Company Expense Reimbursement pursuant to
this _Section 8.03(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_. In

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.03(b)_ and _Section 8.03(c)_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to  _Section 8.03(b)_
or _Section 8.03(c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences
an Action that results in a judgment in its favor for such payment, the
Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such Action, together with interest on the
amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins
accruing. The parties agree that the receipt of the Termination Fee and/or the
Company Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, together with the amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event such
amounts are paid by the Company and accepted by Parent, and, upon payment of
such amounts by the Company and the acceptance of such amounts by Parent, the
Company, the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee or the Company Expense
Reimbursement on more than one occasion; provided, however, that (i)
the Company may be required to pay both the Company Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_ and a portion of the Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ and (ii) no such payment shall relieve any
Person from any liability or damages arising out of: (x) fraud in connection
with this Agreement or (y) any willful or intentional breach of any provision
of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law requires further approval by
the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders, and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this
Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company
unless required by Applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties and there
shall be no amendment to _Sections 8.04_ , _8.05_ , _9.07_ and _9.08_ (or any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment of such provision
would modify the substance of _Sections 8.04_ , _8.05_ , _9.07_ or _9.08_ )
in a manner that would be adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



70 Section 8.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in

modify the substance of _Sections 8.04_ , _8.05_ , _9.07_ or _9.08_ ) in a
manner that would be adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources. No extension or waiver by the
Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless
such approval is required by Applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.06. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.04_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 8.05_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the
duly authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of either
Parent or the Company.

Section or an Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any term defined in this
Agreement shall have its defined meaning throughout this Agreement and in each
Exhibit to this Agreement, regardless of whether it appears before or after
the place where it is defined. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby",
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"

Section 9.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Applicable
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this _Section 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii) hereby agrees that no Financing

Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case any Delaware state or federal court within the State

event any dispute,

 



82  claim or cause of action arises out of or relates to this Agreement or the

unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 9.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law. No party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, will bring, or support the
bringing of, any claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this

any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, anywhere other than in (i) any New York State court
sitting in the County of New York or (ii) the United States District Court for

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,

ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING
ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY

ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,

respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 9.09_ shall be null and void.

Section 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, may not
be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or

 



83  threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right
of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason.

Section 9.11. _Tax Reporting_. Except to the extent any portion of any CVR
Payment Amount is required to be treated as interest pursuant to Applicable
Law, the Parties hereto agree to treat the CVRs issued pursuant to the Merger
Agreement for all Tax purposes as consideration for the shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company
Deferred Stock Awards and Company Performance Cash Awards, and none of the
Parties hereto will take any position to the contrary on any Tax Return
or for other Tax purposes except as required by Applicable Law. Except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, the Company shall determine the portion of any
CVR Payment Amount required to be treated as interest for U.S. federal income
tax purposes pursuant to Section 483 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Capitalized terms used in this Section that are not
otherwise defined in this Agreement shall be as defined in the CVR Agreement.
