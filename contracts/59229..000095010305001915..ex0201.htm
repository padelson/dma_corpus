 ARTICLE II

 

 THE MERGER

 

  Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

 

  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into
the Company in accordance with Delaware Law and South Carolina Law, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

  (b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
properly executed certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State,
properly executed articles of merger with the South Carolina Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law and
South Carolina Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at (i) the later of (A) the date and time of the filing of the
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, or (B) the date
and time of the filing of the articles of merger with the South Carolina
Secretary of State, or (ii) such later time as may be specified in the
certificate of merger and the articles of merger (such date and time being
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

 

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law and South
Carolina Law (including, without limitation, Section 259 of Title 8 of
Delaware Law and Section 33-11-106 of South Carolina Law).

 

  Section 2.02 _Consummation_. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to ARTICLE X, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX (other than those that by their
terms are satisfied at the Closing), the consummation of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Robinson, Bradshaw and Hinson,
P.A., 101 N. Tryon Street, Suite 1900, Charlotte, North Carolina, as soon as
possible, but in no event later than 5 Business Days after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX, or at such other time or
place as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 

  Section 2.03 _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, the
Company, Merger Subsidiary or any holder of the capital stock thereof:

 

  (a) each share of Common Stock held as treasury stock or owned by the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto;

 

  (b) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one

 

 7   
     

 share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted; and

 

  (c) each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(a),
be converted into the right to receive in cash an amount equal to $47.35 (the
"Merger Consideration"), payable, without interest, to the holder thereof upon
surrender of the Certificate therefor in the manner provided in Section 2.04.

 

  Section 2.04 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging certificates representing shares of Common Stock (the
"Certificates") for the applicable Merger Consideration, and Parent and
Exchange Agent shall enter into an exchange agreement which shall, in form and
substance, be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent
in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Common Stock, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
required to be paid for all of the Certificates at the Effective Time. Any
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall not be used for any purpose other
than as set forth in this ARTICLE II (until released as described herein) and
shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in: (A) direct obligations of, or obligations the
principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the
United States of America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition
thereof not in excess of 90 days, (B) money market accounts or certificates
of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America
or a State thereof having a combined capital surplus in excess of
$500,000,000 (a "United States Bank"), (C) commercial paper issued by a
domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A1 by Standard and
Poors Corporation and P1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. with a remaining
term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days or (D) demand
deposits with any United States Bank. The earnings and interest thereon shall
be paid to Parent or as Parent directs. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder
of record of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a
Certificate in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
(which shall (i) be in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the
Company and (ii) specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

  (b) Each holder of shares of Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
a properly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the applicable Merger Consideration
in respect of the Common Stock represented by a Certificate. Such payment of
the applicable Merger Consideration shall be sent to such holder of shares of
Common Stock promptly after receipt of such Certificate and letter of
transmittal by the Exchange Agent. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for

 

8   
     

 all purposes only the right to receive such applicable Merger Consideration.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of
the Certificates.

 

  (c) If any portion of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Common Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE II. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of
the Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Stock except as otherwise provided herein.

 

  (e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and any earnings and interest
thereon that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Common Stock six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Common Stock for the
applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Common Stock
for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  Section 2.05 _Restricted Stock; Company Stock Options_.

 

  (a) Each holder of shares of Common Stock granted or issued under the
Companys Performance Incentive Compensation Program (Amended and Restated -
2000) (the "Incentive Plan") that would otherwise be subject to a risk of
forfeiture at the Effective Time ("Restricted Stock") shall become fully
vested in any such shares of Restricted Stock as of the Effective Time. Shares
of Restricted Stock as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.03 hereof.

 

  (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexercised,
outstanding option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under
the Incentive Plan (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be canceled, and Parent shall pay or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay each holder at or promptly after

 

9   
     

 the Effective Time for each such Company Stock Option surrendered for
cancellation an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock such holder
could have purchased under such Company Stock Option (assuming full vesting)
had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company has adopted a resolution providing that each outstanding Company
Stock Option shall, at the Effective Time, be adjusted, as provided in
Section 3(D) of the Incentive Plan, to be exercisable to acquire the Merger
Consideration, without any interest, for each share of Common Stock for which
such Company Stock Option could have been exercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall not be exercisable to acquire any Common Stock at or
after the Effective Time or any equity interest in the Surviving Corporation,
which resolution has not been modified or rescinded, and the Company agrees
that such resolution shall not be modified or rescinded during the term of
this Agreement.

 

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents from holders of Company Stock Options
in the form agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the date hereof. Any
such consent, once obtained, shall not be amended or modified by the Company
without Parents prior consent.

 

  Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of
Company Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.

 

  Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this ARTICLE II such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock in respect of which the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

  Section 2.08 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability
company and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All

to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party which is material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that is to be
performed in whole or part after the date hereof (a "Material Contract") is a
valid and binding agreement of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as
the case may be, and is in full force and effect. No condition or state of
facts exists that, with notice or the passage of time, or both,
would constitute a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the knowledge of the Company, any third party under such Material Contracts,
in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company or its applicable Subsidiary has duly complied
with the provisions of each Material Contract to which it is a party, except

other agreement, contract, plan, lease, arrangement or commitment of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a valid and binding agreement of the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, and is in full force and
effect, and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge

respect under the terms of any such agreement, contract, plan, lease,
arrangement or commitment, in each case, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Set forth on _Schedule 4.12_ is a

  Section 4.13 _Intellectual Property_. (i) The Company owns or has the
legally enforceable right to use pursuant to license, sublicense, agreement
or otherwise all material Intellectual Property used in the operation of the
business of the Company, (ii) the operation of the business of the Company
does not interfere with, infringe upon or misappropriate the Intellectual
Property of any other Person and no facts or circumstances exist that, with or
without the passing of time or the giving of notice or both, would reasonably
be expected to serve as the basis for any such claim; (iii) no Person
has, since January 1, 2003, asserted in writing against the Company a demand
or claim that the Company is interfering with, infringing upon, violating or
misappropriating the Intellectual Property of such Person, and (iv) to the
Companys knowledge, no Person is interfering with, infringing upon,
violating or misappropriating any material Intellectual Property owned by the
Company, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) to the extent such
interference, infringement or misappropriation would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

  Section 4.14 _Compliance with Laws and Court Orders; Permits_.

 

  (a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of, and has not since January 1, 2003 violated, any applicable Law, except

Effect. The Stations are, and as of

 

 18   
     

 immediately prior to the Closing will be, owned and operated by Company and
its Subsidiaries in compliance with (i) the terms of the FCC Licenses and (ii)
the Communications Act and the FCC Rules, in each case, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have (x) filed or made all applications, reports and other
disclosures required by the FCC to be made in respect of the Stations and (y)
have or will have timely paid all FCC regulatory fees in respect thereof, in
each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

  (b) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has obtained all
permits, licenses, franchises, certificates, approvals and
similar authorizations of Governmental Authorities necessary to conduct their
respective businesses in accordance with past practice, except for failures
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Such permits, licenses, franchises,
certificates, approvals and authorizations are valid and in full force and
effect, and no such licenses or permits will be terminated or materially
impaired or become terminable as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (assuming receipt of the consents and approvals referred to in
Sections 4.03 and 4.04), except for those that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

  Section 4.15 _Litigation_. There is no claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties before any Governmental
Authority that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or that in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or
materially delay the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, nor are there, to the knowledge of the Company, any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
claim, action, suit or investigation.

 

  Section 4.16 _FCC Matters_. Set forth on _Schedule 4.16_ is a
complete and accurate list of all of the material licenses, permits and
authorizations issued by the FCC for the operation of the Stations and of the
pending FCC application for a new television station construction permit
to serve Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (BPCT-19960920WV) (collectively, the
"FCC Licenses") and the holder of each such FCC License (each a "Licensee"),
noting the expiration dates. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.16_ , the FCC
Licenses are in full force and effect, either in accordance with their terms
or by operation of Section 307(c) of the Communications Act, and have not been
revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded or terminated and have not expired,
and are not subject to any conditions except for conditions applicable to
television licenses generally or as otherwise disclosed on the face of the FCC
Licenses, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The FCC Licenses constitute all the FCC
authorizations necessary to own and operate the Stations in substantially the
same manner as they are being operated in all material respects. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 4.16_ , (i) there is not any pending, or to the Companys
knowledge, threatened, action by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel,
rescind or materially adversely modify any of the FCC Licenses (other than
proceedings to amend FCC Rules of general applicability) and (ii) there is
not issued or outstanding by or before the FCC, or to the Companys knowledge,
threatened, any order to show cause, cease and desist order, investigation,
notice of violation, notice of apparent liability, or order of
forfeiture against the Stations or the Company that would reasonably be
expected to

 

19   
     

 result in any such action, in each case, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on _Schedule
4.16_ , there is not pending any petition to deny or other objection against
any license renewal or other pending application of the Stations. Except as
set forth in _Schedule 4.16_ , the Stations are operating in compliance with
the FCC Licenses, the Communications Act and the rules, regulations and
policies of the FCC (the "FCC Rules"), except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are, and as of the Closing shall be, legally and otherwise qualified under the
Communications Act and the FCC Rules to own and operate the Stations, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except
as disclosed in _Schedule 4.16_ , (i) there are no facts or circumstances
pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries which, under
the Communications Act or the FCC Rules, would reasonably be expected to (x)
result in the FCCs refusal to grant the FCC Consent or (y) materially delay
obtaining the FCC Consent.

no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, in connection with any fairness opinion). The Company has
heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of all agreements
between the Company and UBS Securities LLC pursuant to which such firm would
be entitled to any payment from the Company or its Subsidiaries related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 4.18 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received

  Section 4.20 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

  (a) _Schedule 4.20(a)_ contains a correct and complete list identifying
each material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
each employment, severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy
and each other material plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for
compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related
rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or
medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick
leave benefits, workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits,
severance benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is
maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company and covers any current or former employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable,
related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments
thereto and written interpretations thereof have been made available to Parent
together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including,
if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in
connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans are referred to
collectively herein as the "Employee Plans."

six years sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA.

 

  (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company nor any

  (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or
has pending an application for such determination from the Internal Revenue
Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination
letter should be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to
Parent copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letters with respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been
maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including
ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No events have
occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or
assessment by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under
Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the

  (e) Except as provided in Section 2.05 or as disclosed in _Schedule
4.20(e)_ , the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any
employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any bonus,
retirement, severance, job security or similar benefit or to an enhancement
of any such benefit or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger
any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under,

 

22   
     

 increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement
(written or otherwise) covering any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would entitle any employee
to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby and/or any termination of employment related thereto, or
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Section 280G, without regard to subsection (b)(4)
thereof, or 162(m) of the Code.

 

  (f) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.20(f)_ , neither the Company nor

health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as required to
avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

 

  (g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, an Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

 

  (h) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 4.20(h)_ , neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to, or is currently
negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining
agreement or other contract or understanding with a labor union or
organization. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to be material, (i) there are no unfair labor practice
charges or complaints against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending
before the National Labor Relations Board, (ii) there are no labor
strikes, slowdowns or stoppages actually pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to individuals
employed by the Company or any such Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the

its Subsidiaries under any such agreement or contract. No union contracts or
collective bargaining agreements are currently scheduled for renewal prior to
January 2006, and with respect to all such contracts currently scheduled
for renewal, the Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to make the renewal of any such contract
unlikely.

 

  (i) There is no material action, suit, investigation, audit or
proceeding pending against or involving or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan before any
Governmental Authority.

 

  (j) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
currently applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except for failures
to comply that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty
has been assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or
review (or any basis therefor) is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
is threatened by any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Law and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim,
notice or proceeding; 

 

  (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance
with all Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits;

Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and (z) to be responsible for any breach of such terms by such

employee thereof as of the Effective Time (a "Company Employee") base salary
or wage rates that are no less than those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided,_
_however,_ that if a Company Employee is paid on a commission basis, no

relevant commission agreement or arrangement. Except with respect to severance
to the extent separate severance benefits are provided for in Section
7.04(d), from and after the Effective Time, Company Employees shall be

without limitation, any annual incentive plan, on the same basis as similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that this
Section 7.04(a) shall not apply to any employees represented by a union or
employee association for purposes of collective bargaining.

 

  (b) Each Company Employee will receive service credit for all periods
of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
thereof prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility and
benefit levels under any employee benefit plan in which such employee
participates after the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was
recognized under any analogous plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that no such
service credit shall be given if it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

  (c) (i) From and after the Effective Time, (x) those former employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries who as of such time are receiving benefits
under the post-retirement medical and dental plans sponsored or maintained by

Employees who have a credited retiree medical eligibility date prior to
January 1, 1993 or who are fully eligible to receive benefits under such
Designated Plans as of the Effective Time, together, in each case, with the
covered dependents of each such employee (collectively, the "Designated
Employees") shall continue to receive, remain eligible to receive or receive
at some future time, as the case may be, benefits under the Designated Plans
in accordance with the terms of such plans as in effect as of the date hereof,
or as may be amended by Parent in accordance with the terms of the Designated
Plans; provided, however, that no such amendment shall reduce benefits under
any Designated Plan or otherwise impair the rights of any Designated
Employee. Employees who are not Designated Employees

 

36   
     

 will not be eligible or have the right or ability to become eligible to
receive such benefits after the Effective Time and the Designated Plans shall
be amended by Parent to implement the provisions of this Section 7.04(c) .

covered under any benefit plan providing medical, dental,
health, pharmaceutical or vision benefits (a "Successor Plan"), other than
the plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Prior Plan"), any such Successor Plan shall not include any
restrictions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such
exclusions or requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior
Plan), and any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the calendar year in which the Company Employee
becomes covered under any Successor Plan shall be taken into account under
any such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or his
or her covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such expenses
were incurred during a period in which the Company Employee or covered
dependent was covered under a corresponding Prior Plan.

 

  (f) Except as otherwise specifically set forth above, nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring the Surviving Corporation, Parent, its
Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue any specific
Employee Plan. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any specific person. No
Company Employee shall have any third party beneficiary rights or rights to
any specific levels of compensation or benefits as a result of the application
of this Section 7.04. 

 

  Section 7.05 _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 

  (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law, South
Carolina Law or any other applicable Law or provided under the Companys and
its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and bylaws or other organization
documents in effect on the date hereof.

 

37   
     

  (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers and directors liability insurance, fiduciary
liability insurance and employment practices liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person currently covered by such insurance policies carried by
the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms with respect to coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that such policies can be obtained for premiums not exceeding 250%
of the amount per annum that the Company and its Subsidiaries paid in its last
full fiscal year, and, if not, on such terms with respect to coverage and
amount as favorable as possible relative to the terms of such policy in
effect on the date hereof as can be obtained for premiums of 250% of such
amount.

 

  (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

 

  (d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.05 shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles
of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law, South Carolina Law or any
other applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

 

 ARTICLE VIII

 

 COVENANTS OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY

 

  The parties hereto agree that:

 

  Section 8.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the Required Consents). Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the Company agree to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement

 

38   
     

 expeditiously the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties
hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of any party
hereto shall be deemed to include compliance with the requirements of Section
8.02(b) hereof, but shall not otherwise require any entry into a settlement,
undertaking, consent, decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any
divestiture or holding separate (including by establishing a trust or
otherwise), or taking of any other material action (or otherwise agreeing to
do any of the foregoing) with respect to its or the Surviving Corporations
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates businesses, assets or
properties.

 

  (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10
Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable. In connection with the foregoing, the parties agree
to (a) cooperate with each other in preparing and submitting such HSR Act
filings, which cooperation shall include furnishing the other with any
information or documents in such partys possession that may be reasonably
required in connection with such filings; (b) furnish each other with
correspondence from or to, and notify each other of any other communications
with, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the United States Department of
Justice ("DOJ") which correspondence relates to the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (c) to the extent practicable, permit each other to participate
in any conferences with the FTC or the DOJ.

 

  Section 8.02 _FCC Consent and FCC License Renewals_.

 

  (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in
any event no later than ten Business Days thereafter, the Company,
the Licensees and Parent shall file with the FCC applications requesting the
FCC Consent (the "Transfer Applications"). The Company and Parent will
cooperate in the preparation of the Transfer Applications, will diligently
take and will cooperate in the taking of all reasonable steps necessary to
prosecute expeditiously the Transfer Applications, and will use reasonable
best efforts to obtain promptly the FCC Consent. The Company will diligently
take all reasonable steps to ensure that all of the FCC permits, licenses and
authorizations held by the Company are included in the Transfer Applications
and, in the event that either Parent or the Company identifies an FCC
permit, license or authorization that has not been included in the Transfer
Applications subsequent to the filing of the Transfer Applications, then the
Company and Parent will cooperate to take such reasonable actions as are
necessary to remedy the omission of such FCC permit, license or authorization
from the Transfer Applications. As part of the Transfer Applications, Parent
will request (i) temporary waivers of Section 73.3555(b) (the "Local
Television Ownership Rule") in the Toledo, Wilmington, Columbia and Albany
markets to provide not more than six months from the Effective Time within
which to come into compliance with such rule and (ii) a satellite
exemption from the Local Television Ownership Rule for the Lufkin station.
Such requests will include all factual information, representations and
undertakings that are customary, and Parent shall promptly provide such
additional information, representations or undertakings as the FCC may
reasonably request. Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain

 

39   
     

 the temporary waivers and the exemption at the earliest practicable time.
The parties will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to oppose any
petition to deny or other objections filed with respect to the
Transfer Applications and any requests for reconsideration or judicial review
of the FCC Consent.

 

  (b) In the event that the FCC Consent has not been granted as of March
1, 2006 and the failure to obtain such FCC Consent reasonably could
be attributed, in whole or in part, to the application of the Local
Television Ownership Rule in the Albany, Columbia, Toledo or Wilmington
markets, Parent shall, on not less than 30 days written notice given by the
Company at any time following March 1, 2006, file one or more applications
with the FCC seeking consent to divestiture of properties necessary to achieve
compliance with the Local Television Ownership Rule in such markets, such
divestiture to be to either a qualified buyer or an independent trustee,
subject to terms and conditions that will preclude the Stations that are the
subject of divestiture from being "attributable" to Parent subsequent to
divestiture under applicable FCC Rules. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain grant of any such applications at the earliest practicable
time.

 

  (c) In order to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the
Transfer Applications, Parent agrees, as part of the Transfer
Applications, to request that the FCC apply its policy permitting license
transfers in transactions involving multiple markets to proceed,
notwithstanding the pendency of one or more license renewal applications.
Parent agrees to make such representations and undertakings as are necessary
or appropriate to invoke such policy, including (without limitation)
undertakings to assume the position of applicant with respect to any pending
license renewal applications, and to assume the risks relating to
such applications. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay, materially impede or prevent receipt of the
FCC Consent.

 

  (d) Parent acknowledges that, as of the date of this Agreement,
license renewal applications are pending before the FCC with respect to each
of the Stations other than KGBT-TV-DT (Harlingen, Texas), KCBD-TV-DT
(Lubbock, Texas), KTRE(TV)-DT (Lufkin, Texas) and KLTV(TV)-DT (Tyler, Texas)
(each such Station the license for which is subject to a renewal application,
a "Renewal Station" and each such pending license renewal application a
"Renewal Application"). To the extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant
of a Renewal Application, and thereby facilitate grant of the Transfer
Applications, the Company shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements
with the FCC with respect to the relevant Renewal Station to extend, for a
period of up to three (3) years following the date of renewal, the statute of
limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against
such Renewal Station in connection with any pending complaints that such
Renewal Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane
material (a "Tolling Agreement"). The Company shall consult in good faith with
Parent prior to entering into any such Tolling Agreement and shall furnish a
copy of such Tolling Agreement to Parent prior to entering into such Tolling
Agreement

 

40   
     

  Section 8.03 _Certain Filings_.

 

  (a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in
connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, (ii)
in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Company
Proxy Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.

 

  (b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Company Proxy Statement each time before
such document (or any amendment thereto) is filed with the SEC. In addition,
Parent shall have the right to review to approve all of the information
relating to Parent and any of its Subsidiaries proposed to appear in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto submitted to the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, Parent shall act reasonably and promptly. The Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel with a copy of any written comments that
the Company may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications.

 

  Section 8.04 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other
public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call
before such consultation. 

 

  Section 8.05 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

 

  Section 8.06 ___Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of: 

  (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

41   
     

  (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (c) any fact or condition that would make any of the conditions in
ARTICLE IX hereof not reasonably likely to be fulfilled; and

 

  (d) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 4.15 or Section 5.06, as the case may be, or that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 8.07 _Control of Stations_. Parent shall not directly or
indirectly control, supervise or direct the operations of the Stations prior
to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC Rules, the
control, supervision and direction of the operation of the Stations prior to
Closing will remain the responsibility of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
the holders of the FCC Licenses.

49    
     

 parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
