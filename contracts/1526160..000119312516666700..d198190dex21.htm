acting reasonably) as the High Court and/or the Panel may approve or direct
from time to time in connection with the implementation of the Scheme
in accordance with applicable Law as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the approval or (as the case may be) direction of the High Court and/or the
Panel to publish or post such documents being obtained; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (j) | unless the Fleetmatics Board has effected a Fleetmatics
Change of Recommendation pursuant to Clause 5.2, and subject to the
obligations of the Fleetmatics Board under the Takeover Rules, procure that
the Scheme Document include the Scheme Recommendation;

     | (k) | include in the Scheme Document a notice convening the EGM to
be held immediately following the Court Meeting to consider and, if thought
fit, approve the EGM Resolutions;

20 to the Court Meeting of the number of proxy votes received in respect of
resolutions to be proposed at the Court Meeting and/or the EGM, and in any
event provide such number promptly upon the request of Verizon or its
Representatives and, unless the Fleetmatics Board has effected a Fleetmatics
Change of Recommendation, conduct any proxy solicitation exercise and
undertake any other steps as may be agreed by the Parties, acting reasonably,
to assist the passing of the Resolutions at the Court Meeting and/or the EGM; 
---|---|--- 



     | (n) | notwithstanding any Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation,
unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Clause 9, hold the Court
Meeting and the EGM on the date set out in the Scheme Document, or such
later date as may be agreed in writing between the Parties, and in such a
manner as shall be approved, if necessary, by the High Court and/or the Panel
and propose the Resolutions without any amendments, unless such amendments
have been agreed to in writing with Verizon, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; 
---|---|--- 



     | (o) | afford all such cooperation and assistance as may reasonably
be requested of it by Verizon in respect of the preparation and verification
of any document or in connection with any Clearance or confirmation
reasonably required for the implementation of the Scheme, including the
provision to Verizon of such information and confirmations relating to it, its
Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective directors or employees as
Verizon may reasonably request (including for the purposes of preparing the
Proxy Statement) and to do so in a timely manner and assume responsibility
only for the information relating to it contained in the Scheme Document or
any other document sent to Fleetmatics Shareholders or filed with the High
Court or in any announcement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (p) | review and provide comments (if any) in a timely manner on
all documentation submitted to it; 
---|---|--- 



     | (q) |

following the Court Meeting and EGM, assuming the Resolutions are duly passed
(including by the requisite majorities required under Section 453 of the Act
in the case of the Court Meeting) and all other Conditions are satisfied or,
in the sole discretion of the applicable Party, waived where applicable (with
the exception of Conditions 2(c) and 2(d)), (i) take all necessary steps on
the part of Fleetmatics to prepare and issue, serve and lodge all such court
documents as are required to seek the sanction of the High Court to the Scheme
as soon as possible thereafter and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts so as
to ensure that the Court Hearing occurs as promptly as practicable thereafter;
provided, however, that, in the event Verizon would otherwise have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Clause 9.1(a)(ix) and has sought to
exercise that right by delivering a notice of termination in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, Fleetmatics shall have the right to seek at the
then scheduled Court Hearing a reasonable postponement of the Court Hearing
(but in no event to a date later than the third Business Day prior to the End
Date) and, if Fleetmatics shall have exercised its 

---|---|--- 
 



21 Clause 3.1(q), (1) Fleetmatics shall not seek to have the High Court take any
action at the Court Hearing (including seeking the High Courts sanction of
the Scheme) other than seeking the High Courts approval of such postponement
and (2) no such notice of termination delivered by Verizon shall be effective
(x) until the time at which the High Court shall have declined to grant such
postponement, or (y) if such postponement has been granted and, taking into
account such postponement, the Pre-Sanction Period has not then commenced (it
being understood that such termination notice shall in the
circumstances described in clause (y) be deemed to have been revoked and
rescinded, provided, however, that, nothing shall prevent Verizon from
delivering a new notice of termination pursuant to Clause 9.1(a)(ix) during a
subsequent Pre-Sanction Period, including with respect to the same underlying
cause that gave rise to Verizons right to terminate under Clause 9.1(a)(ix)
if such condition remains in existence when such new notice of termination is
delivered); provided, further, however, that, (A) for the avoidance of doubt,
in no circumstance shall a notice from Verizon invoking the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Clause 9.1(a)(ix) delivered during the Pre-Sanction
Period be considered to be untimely delivered as a result of the delayed
effectiveness provisions set forth in this Clause 3.1(q) and (B) if
Fleetmatics shall not have irrevocably committed to Fleetmatics in writing
(which commitment may be delivered by email), by no later than one hour prior
to the scheduled commencement of the Court Hearing, that it will exercise its
right to seek such postponement in accordance with this Clause 3.1(q) at the
Court Hearing, such notice of termination shall become effective immediately
prior to the commencement of the Court Hearing; and 
---|--- 



     | (r) | give such undertakings as are required by the High Court in
connection with the Scheme and as are reasonably necessary or desirable to
implement the Scheme. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3.2 | Responsibilities of Bidco and Verizon in Respect of the Scheme 
---|--- 

Bidco shall (and Verizon will procure that Bidco shall), and in the case of
Clauses 3.2(b), 3.2(c), 3.2(d), 3.2(e), 3.2(f) and 3.2(g), Verizon shall:



     | (a) | instruct counsel to appear on its behalf at the Court
Hearing and undertake to the High Court to be bound by the terms of the Scheme
(including the issuance of the Cash Consideration pursuant thereto);  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if, and to the extent that, it or any of its Concert Parties
owns or is interested in Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares, exercise all of its
rights, and, insofar as lies within its powers, procure that each of its
Concert Parties shall exercise all rights, in respect of such Fleetmatics
Ordinary Shares so as to implement, and otherwise support the implementation
of, the Scheme, including by voting (and, in respect of interests in
Fleetmatics held via contracts for difference or other derivative
instruments, insofar as lies within its powers, procuring that instructions
are given to the holder of the underlying Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares to vote)
in favour of the Resolutions or, if required by Law, the High Court, the
Takeover Rules or other rules, refraining from voting, at any Court Meeting
and/or EGM as the case may be; 
---|---|--- 
 



22 insofar as lies within its power or procurement, their Representatives take
all such steps as are reasonably necessary or desirable in order to implement
the Scheme, including the provision by Bidco of any customary undertakings
required by the High Court to be provided to it by Bidco; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | keep Fleetmatics reasonably informed and consult with
Fleetmatics as to the performance of the obligations and responsibilities
required of Verizon and Bidco pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Scheme and
as to any developments relevant to the proper implementation of the Scheme; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | afford all such cooperation and assistance as may reasonably
be requested of it by Fleetmatics in respect of the preparation and
verification of any document or in connection with any Clearance or
confirmation required for the implementation of the Scheme, including the
provision to Fleetmatics of such information and confirmations relating to it,
its Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective directors or employees as
Fleetmatics may reasonably request (including for the purposes of preparing
the Proxy Statement) and to do so in a timely manner and assume responsibility
only for the information relating to it contained in the Scheme Document or
any other document sent to Fleetmatics Shareholders or filed with the High
Court or in any announcement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | review and provide comments (if any) in a reasonably timely
manner on all documentation submitted to it; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Fleetmatics of
any other matter of which it becomes aware which would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent filing of the Scheme Document or
implementation of the Scheme or the Acquisition, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 



   3.3 | Mutual Responsibilities of the Parties 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If any of the Parties becomes aware of any information that,
pursuant to the Takeover Rules, the Act, the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Scheme Document
or the Proxy Statement, or that is required to be included therein in order
that the information therein shall not contain an untrue statement or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the information or statements therein not false or misleading at the
time and in light of the circumstances under which such information is
included or statements made, then the Party becoming so aware shall promptly
inform the other Parties thereof and the Parties shall cooperate with each
other in submitting or filing such amendment or supplement with the Panel,
and, if required, the SEC and/or the High Court and, if required, in mailing
such amendment or supplement to the Fleetmatics Shareholders and, for
information only, if required, to the holders of the Fleetmatics Options or
Fleetmatics Share Awards; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Each of the Parties shall take, or cause to be taken, such
other steps as are reasonably required of it for the proper implementation of
the Scheme, including those required of it pursuant to Clauses 8.1 in
connection with Completion. 
---|---|--- 
 



23 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Each of the Parties will promptly provide such assistance
and information as may reasonably be requested by any other Party in
connection with any correspondence or discussions with the Panel in connection
with the Scheme and/or the Acquisition. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Save where prohibited by the Panel, each of the Parties will
(i) give the other reasonable prior notice of any proposed meeting or material
substantive discussion or correspondence between it or its Representatives
with the Panel, or any amendment to be proposed to the Scheme in connection
therewith, and afford the other reasonable opportunities to review and make
comments and suggestions with respect to the same and accommodate such
comments and suggestions to the extent that such Party, acting reasonably,
considers these to be appropriate and (ii) keep the other reasonably informed
of all such meetings, discussions or correspondence that it or its
Representative(s) have with the Panel and not participate in any meeting or
discussion with the Panel concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in
advance, and, unless prohibited by the Panel, gives such other Party the
opportunity to attend and provide copies of all written submissions it makes
to the Panel and copies (or, where verbal, a verbal or written summary of the
substance) of the Panel responses thereto provided always that any
correspondence or other information required to be provided under this Clause
3.4(b) may be redacted: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to remove references concerning the valuation of the
businesses of Fleetmatics; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns
(provided that the redacting Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
result in such privilege concerns). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Fleetmatics undertakes, if so reasonably requested by
Verizon, to issue as promptly as reasonably practicable its written consent to
Verizon and to the Panel in respect of any application made by Verizon to the
Panel:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to redact any commercially sensitive or confidential
information specific to Verizons financing arrangements for the Acquisition
("Verizon Financing Information") from any documents that Verizon is required
to display pursuant to Rule 26(b)(xi) of the Takeover Rules; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | for a derogation from the requirement under the Takeover
Rules to disclose Verizon Financing Information in the Scheme Document, any
supplemental document or other document sent to Fleetmatics Shareholders or
the holders of the Fleetmatics Options or Fleetmatics Share Awards pursuant
to the Takeover Rules. 
---|---|--- 
 



24 Verizon, to issue as promptly as reasonably practicable its written consent to
Verizon and to the Panel in respect of any application made by Verizon to the
Panel requesting a derogation from the timing requirement pursuant to Rule
30.2 of the Takeover Rules in connection with the despatch of the Scheme
Document to Fleetmatics Shareholders where compliance with such timing
requirement will not be possible within the 28 day period after the date of
the Rule 2.5 announcement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 3.4,
(i) Fleetmatics shall not be required to take any action pursuant to such
provisions if (A) such action is prohibited by the Panel (unless the
Panel decision is successfully appealed by either Fleetmatics or Verizon) or
(B) Fleetmatics has made a Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation and (ii) no
Party shall be required to take any actions pursuant to this Clause 3.4 if
such actions relate to a matter (A) where the interests of Fleetmatics and
Verizon are, or are reasonably likely to be, adverse or (B) involving a person
who has made, or is reasonably likely to make, a Fleetmatics Alternative
Proposal (or any Affiliate of, or persons Acting in Concert with, such
person). 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit the
Parties obligations under the Takeover Rules or the Act. 
---|---|--- 



   3.5 | No Scheme Amendment by Fleetmatics 
---|--- 

Save as required by Law, the High Court and/or the Panel, Fleetmatics shall
not:



     | (a) | amend the Scheme; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

adjourn or postpone (or propose an adjournment or postponement of) the Court
Meeting or the EGM; provided, however, that Fleetmatics may, without the
consent of Verizon, adjourn or postpone (or propose to adjourn or postpone)
the Court Meeting or EGM, (i) in the case of adjournment, if requested by the
Fleetmatics Shareholders (on a poll) to do so, provided, that the resolution
was not proposed by Fleetmatics or any of its Affiliates or any of its or its
Affiliates officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives,
(ii) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Fleetmatics
Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is material to
shareholders voting at the Court Meeting or the EGM, but only for so long as
the Fleetmatics Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with
outside counsel, that such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to give
the Fleetmatics Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure
or information so provided or disseminated, 

---|---|--- 
 



25 scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient
Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Court Meeting or
the EGM, but only until a meeting can be held at which the Fleetmatics Board,
acting reasonably, believes there will be a sufficient number of Fleetmatics
Ordinary Shares represented to constitute a quorum or (B) voting for the
approval of the Court Resolutions or the EGM Resolutions, as applicable, but
only until a meeting can be held at which the Fleetmatics Board,
acting reasonably, believes there will be a sufficient number of votes of
holders of Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares to approve the Court Meeting
Resolutions or the EGM Resolutions, as applicable; provided, that the Court
Meeting and EGM are not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30
days after the date for which the Court Meeting and EGM are originally
scheduled (other than any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law, including adjournments or postponements to the extent reasonably
necessary or advisable to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided or made available to Fleetmatics Shareholders
or to permit dissemination of information which is material to shareholders
voting at the Court Meeting and EGM and to give the Fleetmatics shareholders
sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or other
information); or 
---|--- 



     | (c) | amend the Resolutions (in each case, in the form set out in
the Scheme Document); 
---|---|--- 

after despatch of the Scheme Document without the consent of Verizon.



   3.6 | Switching to a Takeover Offer 
---|--- 



     | (a) | In the event (and only in the event) that Verizon reasonably
considers (in its good faith discretion) that a competitive situation exists
or, based on facts known at the time, may reasonably be expected to arise
in connection with the Acquisition, Verizon may elect (and with the Panels
consent) to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer (rather
than the Scheme), whether or not the Scheme Document has been posted, subject
to the terms of this Clause 3.6, and Verizon shall notify Fleetmatics
promptly of any such election made by it to implement the Acquisition by way
of the Takeover Offer (rather than the Scheme). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If Verizon elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the
Takeover Offer pursuant to Clause 3.6(a), Fleetmatics undertakes to provide
Verizon as promptly as reasonably practicable with all such information about
the Fleetmatics Group (including directors and their connected persons) as
may reasonably be required for inclusion in the Takeover Offer Document and to
provide all such other assistance as may reasonably be required by the
Takeover Rules in connection with the preparation of the Takeover Offer
Document, including reasonable access to, and ensuring the provision of
reasonable assistance by, its management and relevant professional advisers. 
---|---|--- 
 



26 the Takeover Offer in accordance with Clause 3.6(a), the Parties mutually
agree: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions in
accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement,
the relevant Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as
agreed (including any modification thereto) between Verizon and the Panel;
provided, however, that the terms and conditions of the Takeover Offer shall
be at least as favourable to the Fleetmatics Shareholders (except for the 80
per cent acceptance condition contemplated by paragraph 9 of Annex III to the
Rule 2.5 Announcement) and the holders of Fleetmatics Options and Fleetmatics
Share Awards and Fleetmatics Employees as those which would apply in relation
to the Scheme; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | to reasonably co-operate and consult with each other in the
preparation of the Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing
which is required for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | that, unless the Fleetmatics Board has previously effected
a Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of
Clause 5.2, the Takeover Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the
holders of the Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares from the Fleetmatics Board to
accept the Takeover Offer, and such recommendation will not thereafter be
withdrawn, adversely modified or qualified except as contemplated by Clause
5.2; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC and, to the
extent required, the Panel and the High Court, all documents, amendments and
supplements required to be filed therewith or submitted thereto pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act in connection with the Takeover Offer
and to make any applications or initiate any appearances that may be required
or desirable to and in front of the High Court for the purpose of
discontinuance of High Court proceedings initiated in connection with the
Scheme and each Party shall have reasonable opportunities to review and make
comments on all such documents, amendments and supplements and, following
reasonable accommodation of such comments and approval of such documents,
amendments and supplements by the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, file or submit, as the case may be, such
documents, amendments and supplements with or to the SEC;  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | to provide the other Party with any comments received from
the SEC on any documents filed by it with the SEC promptly after receipt
thereof; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of
any proposed oral communication with the SEC and, to the fullest extent
permitted by the SEC, afford the other Party reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. 
---|---|--- 
 



27 cause Bidco or its designee to effect as promptly as reasonably practicable a
compulsory acquisition of any Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares under Sections 456
to 460 of the Act not acquired in the Takeover Offer for the same
consideration per share. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | For the avoidance of doubt and except as may be required by
the Takeover Rules (and without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement), nothing in this Clause 3.6 shall require Fleetmatics to provide
Verizon with any information with respect to, or to otherwise take or fail to
take any action in connection with Fleetmatics consideration of or response
to, any Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3.7 | Preparation of Proxy Statement 
---|--- 



     | (a) | As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof, Fleetmatics shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy
materials which shall constitute the Scheme Document, which shall also
constitute the proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the
Fleetmatics Shareholders at the Court Meeting and the EGM (such Proxy
Statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement").
Verizon and Bidco shall cooperate with Fleetmatics in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and furnish all information concerning Verizon or Bidco, as
the case may be, that is required in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. Fleetmatics shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and to mail the Proxy Statement to its
shareholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date of the resolution of any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement), to the
extent required by applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 

Fleetmatics shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
Verizon with copies of any written comments and advise Verizon of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC or the
Staff of the SEC. Fleetmatics shall provide Verizon with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and Fleetmatics will promptly
provide Verizon with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken
by it under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
Acquisition, and each Party shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to any of the Parties, or their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by either Party, and such
information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party

 



28  and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the Fleetmatics Shareholders.



   4. | FLEETMATICS EQUITY AWARDS 
---|--- 



   4.1 | Treatment of Equity Awards 
---|--- 

Neither Verizon nor Bidco nor any of their Affiliates shall assume any
Fleetmatics Options or Fleetmatics Share Awards, whether vested or unvested,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Fleetmatics Share Plans shall be
terminated by Fleetmatics and all Fleetmatics Options and Fleetmatics Share
Awards, whether vested or unvested, that are outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time,
automatically (and without any action on the part of any party hereto or the
holder thereof) be cancelled and terminated and automatically converted into
the right of the holder thereof to receive the consideration set forth below,
if any and as applicable, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.



   4.2 | Fleetmatics Options Granted under the Fleetmatics Share Plans 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Effective as of the Effective Time, each Fleetmatics Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
and whether vested (including, as a result of any applicable vesting
acceleration) or unvested, shall, without any further action on the part of
any holder thereof, be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right of
the former holder of such Fleetmatics Option to receive, for each Fleetmatics
Ordinary Share then subject to such Fleetmatics Option, the Cash
Consideration, without interest and less the exercise price and any required
withholdings applicable to such Fleetmatics Option. Following the Effective
Time, any such cancelled Fleetmatics Option shall no longer be exercisable
for Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares and shall only entitle the holder of such
Fleetmatics Option to the payment described in this Clause 4.2, which shall be
made or caused to be made by Bidco as of, or within thirty (30) days after,
the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per
Ordinary Share of any Fleetmatics Option (whether or not vested) that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time exceeds the Cash
Consideration, such Fleetmatics Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time without the payment of any amount or other consideration in respect
thereof. 
---|---|--- 



   4.3 | Fleetmatics Share Awards Granted under the Fleetmatics Share
Plans 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Effective as of the Effective Time, each Fleetmatics Share Award that is
outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, as
a result of any applicable vesting acceleration) shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right of the former holder of such Fleetmatics Share Award
to receive the Cash 

---|---|--- 
 



29 withholdings applicable to such Fleetmatics Share Award, which shall be made
or caused to be made by Bidco as of, or within thirty (30) days after, the
Effective Time. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Each Fleetmatics Share Award that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (any such Fleetmatics Share
Award, an "Unvested Share Award") shall, without any further action on the
part of any holder thereof, be cancelled, extinguished and converted into the
right of the former holder of such Unvested Share Award to receive, following
the Effective Time, a cash amount equal to the Cash Consideration, without
interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding (if any) (the "Unvested
Share Award Consideration"), payable at such time or times as set forth in
Clause 4.3(c). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | All amounts payable with respect to any Unvested Share Award
shall (i) be deemed earned and vested on the date(s) on which such Unvested
Share Award would otherwise have vested in accordance with the vesting
schedule that applied to such Unvested Share Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any applicable acceleration provisions, except as
otherwise agreed to by Verizon and such former holder in writing), subject to
satisfaction of all applicable vesting conditions on or prior to such vesting
date(s), and (ii) be paid by Verizon or its designee, less any applicable
withholding taxes and in accordance with its payroll procedures, no later than
thirty (30) days following the vesting date(s) of such Unvested Share Award;
provided, however, that any performance measures applicable to such Unvested
Share Award shall be deemed to have been satisfied as of the Effective Time as
if 100% of the applicable performance targets have been achieved and
thereafter such Unvested Share Award will continue to vest based upon the
otherwise applicable time-based vesting schedule subject to acceleration as
provided in this Clause 4.3(c) below; provided further that if prior to the
time at which such Unvested Share Award is fully vested a holders employment
with Fleetmatics and its Subsidiaries is terminated either (I) without Cause
or (II) by reason of the holders disability or death, then, in the case of
any of clauses (I) or (II), the Unvested Share Award Consideration shall be
payable to such holder with respect to such unvested portion of such Unvested
Share Award (together with any other amounts due pursuant to this Clause 4.3
but not yet actually paid) promptly following such termination of employment. 
---|---|--- 



   4.4 | Implementation 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Fleetmatics shall take all necessary actions,
including obtaining appropriate resolutions of Fleetmatics board of directors
(or applicable committee thereof), providing all notices, obtaining any
necessary consents and taking all other actions necessary or desirable to
effect the termination of the Fleetmatics Share Plans and awards outstanding
thereunder, which notices, resolutions, consents and other written materials
shall be subject to the review and approval of Verizon, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



30 ---|--- 

Fleetmatics shall procure that a special resolution be put before the
Fleetmatics Shareholders at the EGM proposing that the Memorandum and Articles
of Association of Fleetmatics be amended so that any Fleetmatics Ordinary
Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the
Scheme or acquired by Bidco for the same consideration per Fleetmatics
Ordinary Share as shall be payable to Fleetmatics Shareholders under the
Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); provided, however, that
nothing in such amendment to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of
Fleetmatics shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise)
of any Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares issued on the exercise of Fleetmatics
Options or vesting or settlement of Fleetmatics Share Awards, as applicable,
following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court,
it being always acknowledged that each and every Fleetmatics Share will be
bound by the terms of the Scheme.

 



   4.6 | Fleetmatics ESPP 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Fleetmatics may continue to operate
the Fleetmatics Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Fleetmatics ESPP") in
accordance with its terms; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Fleetmatics ESPP, (i) Fleetmatics shall not permit any
individual to, and no individual shall, increase the amount of an existing
election, or make a new election, with respect to payroll deductions

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any enquiry with respect to, or
the making or submission of, any 

---|---|--- 
 



36 discussions or negotiations regarding a Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal with,
or furnish any nonpublic information regarding a Fleetmatics Alternative

considering making a Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal, except to notify such
person as to the existence of the provisions of this Clause 5.2, or (iii)

---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Clause 5.2(a), if Fleetmatics
receives a bona fide written Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal or enquiry or
proposal from a person who is intending on making a Fleetmatics Alternative
Proposal and the Fleetmatics Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with Fleetmatics financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that (i) such Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal, enquiry or proposal either
constitutes a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to take the
actions described in clauses (x) and (y) below would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Fleetmatics
Alternative Proposal, enquiry or proposal was made after the date of this
Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Clause 5.2,
Fleetmatics may take any or all of the following actions: (x) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party (and any persons Acting in Concert
with such third party and to their respective potential financing sources and
Representatives) making or intending to make such Fleetmatics Alternative
Proposal (provided that all such information has previously been provided to
Verizon or is provided to Verizon concurrently with the time it is provided
to such person(s)), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
Fleetmatics receives from the third party an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms no less restrictive of such person than the

the third party with respect to such Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal.

lead to a Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal, and shall, in the case of any such
notice, set forth the material terms and conditions of such Fleetmatics
Alternative Proposal or such communication or proposal (including any changes
to such material terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making
any such Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal, and thereafter shall promptly
keep Verizon informed on a current basis of any material change to the terms
and status of any

37 provide to Verizon as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of
all written correspondence and other written material exchanged between
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries and the person making any such
Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal (or such persons Representatives) that
describes any of the material terms or conditions of such Fleetmatics
Alternative Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted by
either party in connection therewith. Fleetmatics shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement
with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits
Fleetmatics from providing such information to Verizon.

     | (c) | Except as set forth in Clauses 5.2(d), (e) and (h) below,
neither the Fleetmatics Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
or fail to make (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Verizon),

manner adverse to Verizon), the Scheme Recommendation or the recommendation
contemplated by Clause 3.6(c)(iii) or (B) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable,

referred to as a "Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation") (it being agreed that
(x) no "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act in and of itself shall constitute a Fleetmatics Change of
Recommendation and, (y) for the avoidance of doubt, the provision
by Fleetmatics to Verizon of notice or information in connection with a
Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal or Fleetmatics Superior Proposal as required
or expressly permitted by this Agreement shall not, in and of itself,
constitute a Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation) or (ii) cause or allow
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, transaction agreement, implementation agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement constituting or with respect to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal, or

delay or fail to consummate the Acquisition (other than as contemplated by
Clause 5.2(h)(i) and other than a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by
Clause 5.2(b)). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Fleetmatics Board, in
response to an Intervening Event, from making a Fleetmatics Change of
Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Fleetmatics Shareholder
Approval if the Fleetmatics Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with Fleetmatics outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that Fleetmatics
shall have provided prior written notice to Verizon, at least four
(4) Business Days in advance, of the Fleetmatics Boards intention to make
such Fleetmatics Change of

terms of this Agreement and the Scheme proposed by Verizon in response to
such prior written notice or otherwise, and during such four (4) Business Day

regarding any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Verizon.
Notwithstanding any Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Clause 9, Fleetmatics shall
hold the Court Meeting and the EGM in accordance with Clause 3.1 for purposes
of obtaining the approval of the Resolutions by the requisite majorities of
Fleetmatics Shareholders, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve Fleetmatics of such obligation.

     | (e) | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or
restrict Fleetmatics or the Fleetmatics Board from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Fleetmatics Shareholders a position or making a statement contemplated
by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, or (ii) making any disclosure
to the Fleetmatics Shareholders if in the good faith judgment of the
Fleetmatics Board (after consultation with Fleetmatics outside legal
counsel), failure to so disclose and/or take would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act that relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Fleetmatics Board with
respect to this Agreement, the Scheme and/or the Takeover Offer or a
Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Fleetmatics Change
of Recommendation unless Fleetmatics in connection with such disclosure
publicly states that the Fleetmatics Board expressly rejects the applicable
Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal and expressly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement, the Scheme and/or the Takeover Offer has not
changed or expressly reiterates the prior recommendation of the Fleetmatics
Board, without otherwise disclosing or effecting any Fleetmatics Change of
Recommendation.

arrangement, takeover offer or business combination transaction; (ii) the

surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after
consummation thereof; or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

by any person that the Fleetmatics Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with Fleetmatics financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is more favourable to the Fleetmatics Shareholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account such
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal as the
Fleetmatics Board considers in good faith to be appropriate (it being
understood that, for purposes of the definition of "Fleetmatics Superior
Proposal", references to "20%" in the definition of Fleetmatics Alternative
Proposal shall be deemed to refer to "75%"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | The Parties agree that:

     | (i) |

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Fleetmatics Board, at
any time prior to obtaining the Fleetmatics Shareholder Approval, from making
a Fleetmatics Change of Recommendation and substantially concurrently
therewith Fleetmatics terminating this Agreement in order to substantially
concurrently enter into a definitive written agreement to implement a
Fleetmatics Superior Proposal first made after the date of this Agreement and
that did not result from a breach of this Clause 5.2, provided that, (w) the
Fleetmatics Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation
with Fleetmatics financial advisor and outside legal counsel)) that (1) the
Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal constitutes a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal
and (2) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) promptly upon the
Fleetmatics Boards determination that a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal exists
(and in any event, within 24 hours of such determination), Fleetmatics has
provided a written notice to Verizon (a "Fleetmatics Superior Proposal
Notice") advising Verizon that Fleetmatics has received a Fleetmatics
Alternative Proposal and specifying the information with respect thereto
required by Clause 5.2(b) and including written notice of the determination
of the Fleetmatics Board that the Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal constitutes
a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal, (y) Fleetmatics has provided Verizon with an
opportunity, for a period of four (4) Business Days from the time of delivery
to Verizon of the Fleetmatics Superior Proposal Notice (as may be extended
pursuant to the proviso below, the "Verizon Notice Period"), to propose to
amend (the "Verizon Right to Match") the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Acquisition, including an increase in, or modification of,
the Cash Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a "Verizon Revised
Acquisition"), such that the Fleetmatics Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Fleetmatics Superior Proposal, and (z) at the end of such
Verizon Notice Period, the Fleetmatics Board has determined (after
consultation with Fleetmatics financial advisor and outside legal counsel)

40 Fleetmatics Superior Proposal notwithstanding the Verizon Revised Acquisition
and taking into account all amendments and proposed changes made thereto
during the Verizon Notice Period and (ii) the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. In the event that during the Verizon Notice Period any material revision
is made to the terms of the Fleetmatics Superior Proposal, Fleetmatics shall
be required, upon each such revision, to deliver a new Fleetmatics Superior
Proposal Notice to Verizon and to comply with the requirements of this Clause
5.2(h)(i) with respect to such new Fleetmatics Superior Proposal Notice; and 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | in the event that a competitive situation arises within the
meaning of Rule 31.4 of the Takeover Rules in relation to Verizon and a third
party or parties, Fleetmatics shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain permission from the Panel to provide that the auction procedure
determined by the Panel (if any) shall give effect to and be consistent with
Verizons rights and the obligations of Fleetmatics and the Fleetmatics Board
pursuant to this Clause 5.2(h), and Fleetmatics shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, keep Verizon reasonably informed of any discussions
with the Panel in respect of the determination of such auction procedure.

   6.2 | Verizon and Bidco Representations and Warranties 
---|--- 

Except as disclosed in the applicable section of the disclosure schedule

Agreement (the "Verizon Disclosure Schedule") (it being agreed that disclosure
of any item in any section of the Verizon Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other subclause of this Clause 6.2 to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face without any
independent knowledge of the reader), Verizon and Bidco jointly and severally
represent and warrant to Fleetmatics as follows:



     | (a) | _Qualification, Organisation, Subsidiaries, etc._ Each of
Verizon and Bidco is a legal entity duly organised, validly existing and,
where relevant, in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such

materially impair the ability of Verizon to consummate the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
 



68 Violation_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Each of Verizon and Bidco has all requisite corporate power

duly and validly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Verizon and (in the case of this Agreement) Bidco, and no other corporate
action or proceedings on the part of Verizon or Bidco, or other vote of
Verizon or Bidco stockholders, is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by Verizon or Bidco of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Acquisition, other

applicable requirements of other Antitrust Laws set forth on Clause
6.2(b)(ii) of the Verizon Disclosure Schedule, (H) any applicable requirements

the consummation by Verizon and Bidco of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for such authorisations, consents, approvals or filings (I)
that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially impair the ability of
Verizon to consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (II) as may arise as a result of facts or circumstances
relating to Fleetmatics or its Affiliates or Laws or contracts binding on
Fleetmatics or its Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 



69 this Agreement and (in the case of Verizon) the Expenses Reimbursement
Agreement do not, and, except as described in Clause 6.2(b)(ii), the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not (A) result in any violation or breach of, or
default or change of control (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or

Fleetmatics or its Affiliates or Laws or contracts binding on Fleetmatics or
its Affiliates.

of its properties, rights or assets, and (ii) there are no claims, actions,
suits or proceedings pending (or, to the knowledge of Verizon, threatened)
against Verizon or Bidco or any of their respective properties, rights or
assets before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of, any Relevant

no representation or warranty is made by Verizon with respect to information

---|--- 
 



     | (e) | _No Vote of Verizon Shareholders_. No vote of the

(equity or otherwise) is required by Law, the organizational documents of
Verizon or in order for Verizon to consummate the Acquisition. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Verizon nor any of its

---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Clause 6.1 or in any certificates delivered by
Fleetmatics in connection with the Completion pursuant to Condition

   7.1 | Investigation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Fleetmatics shall afford Verizon and Verizons
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the
period from the release of the Rule 2.5 Announcement until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which the Agreement is terminated

contracts, commitments, books and records, financial and operating data or any
report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws, in each case, for purposes of due diligence
or integration planning and/or effecting the Acquisition; provided, that no
investigation prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement, including by

deemed to modify, diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties
or covenants made by Fleetmatics in this Agreement or the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement; and provided further that any such access shall be
conducted at Verizons expense and under supervision of appropriate personnel
of Fleetmatics. Any request for access or information pursuant to this
Clause 7.1(a) shall be directed to an executive officer of Fleetmatics or
other person designated by Fleetmatics. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Fleetmatics shall not be required to afford such access if it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of Fleetmatics or any of its
Subsidiaries, would cause a loss of privilege to Fleetmatics or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law (provided
that Fleetmatics shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such violation
or loss of privilege). If any material is withheld by Fleetmatics pursuant to
the preceding sentence, Fleetmatics shall (subject to the preceding sentence)
inform the Verizon as to the general nature of what is being withheld.

72 shall be required to be taken solely to the extent necessary to enable the
satisfaction of the Conditions and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition) to occur no later than the

other Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws listed on Schedule
7.2(c)(ii), (C) under the Takeover Rules and the Act or (D) as required by the
High Court; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | keep the other Parties reasonably informed of all material
written or oral communications to or from third parties (other than any
Relevant Authority) with respect to the Clearances; and

actions to obtain from, make with or provide to any third party (including any
Relevant Authority) any Clearances (other than Clearances under any Antitrust
Laws, which shall be governed by Clause 7.2(d)) required to be obtained, made
or provided by Fleetmatics, Bidco or Verizon or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition); provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted to pay nor shall Bidco or
Verizon or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay or permit
Fleetmatics to pay any material fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party for any Clearance required in connection with the consummation of

regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolisation, competition,
antitrust or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each Party
shall provide as promptly as practicable such information and documentary
material as may be requested by a Relevant Authority following any such
filing or notification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Parties agree that Verizon shall, on behalf of the
Parties, control and lead all communications and strategy (both substantive
and procedural, including relating to timing and any voluntary extensions
thereof) relating to the Antitrust Laws (provided that Fleetmatics is not
constrained from complying with applicable Law), provided, further, that the
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good
faith the views of one another, regarding the form and content of any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their
submission.

Authority in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Acquisition); (ii) not participate in any
meeting or material discussion with any Relevant Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation, or enquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
Party in advance, and, unless prohibited by such Relevant Authority, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend; and (iii) promptly furnish the other
Party with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and written
communications between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Relevant Authority or its respective staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the businesses of Fleetmatics or its respective
Affiliates, (y) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns
(provided that the redacting Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would
not result in such privilege concerns) and (z) to prevent the exchange of
confidential information as required by applicable Law. With respect to any
notice, documentation or other communication required to be given by either

74 first Party may give such notice, documentation or other communication to such
second Partys outside counsel, instead of directly to such second Party, if
such first Party reasonably believes that doing so is required by, or
advisable pursuant to, applicable Law. The Parties may, as they deem advisable
and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to
the other under this Clause 7.2(e) as "outside counsel only." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel
of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the Party providing such materials.

     | (f) | In the event that the latest date on which the High Court
and/or the Panel would permit Completion to occur is prior to the End Date,
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
consent of the High Court and/or the Panel, as applicable, to an extension of
such latest date to a date that is not later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the End Date (or the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to
the latest practicable date to which the High Court and/or the Panel will
agree, but not beyond the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the
End Date). If Rule 12(b)(i) of the Takeover Rules may reasonably be expected
to cause the Scheme to lapse, the Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain consent of the Panel to avoid lapsing of the
Scheme pursuant to Rule 12(b)(i) of the Takeover Rules. If (i) the High Court
and/or the Panel require the lapsing of the Scheme prior to the End Date,
(ii) the Scheme lapses pursuant to Rule 12(b)(i) of the Takeover Rules, (iii)
Condition 1 fails to be satisfied or (iv) the Scheme lapses pursuant to
paragraph 7 of Annex I to the Rule 2.5 Announcement as a result of the Scheme
failing to have become effective on or prior to the End Date, the Parties
shall (unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Clause 9)
take all actions required in order to re-initiate the Scheme process as
promptly as reasonably practicable (it being understood that no such lapsing
described in sub-clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall, in and of itself,
result in a termination of, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations of
any Party under, this Agreement).

     | (g) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Verizon and Fleetmatics agree that:

     | (i) |

neither Verizon nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required (and, without
the prior written consent of Verizon, Fleetmatics shall not and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries) to enter into any settlement, undertaking,
commitment, consent decree, stipulation or agreement (or agreement to enter
into any of the foregoing) with any Relevant Entity or third party, including
(A) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of its or its Affiliates respective
capital stock, other securities or ownership interests,
operations, businesses, assets, properties or rights (a "Divestiture") or (B)
the imposition of any limitation on its or its Affiliates respective
abilities and

rights (a "Restraint"), except that, solely to the extent necessary to enable
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Acquisition) to occur no later than the third Business Day prior to the
End Date, Verizon shall use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy Conditions
3(a) and/or 3(b) and/or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any Antitrust Order by agreeing to Divestitures and Restraints (A) the
effectiveness or consummation of which is conditioned on the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Acquisition),

as a whole, or (2) Fleetmatics and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, either
before or immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Acquisition), in each case measured on a scale
relative to Fleetmatics and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, regardless of
whether any such action, condition, restriction or mitigation is in respect of
Verizon, Fleetmatics or their respective Subsidiaries, and (C) that do not
require Verizon to convey any value to any third party other than the sales,
licenses or divestitures of the assets being divested as part of the
Divestiture and reasonable and customary transition support or similar
agreements of limited duration relating to such sales, licenses or
divestitures (provided that any such transition support or similar agreement
shall only be required to be agreed to by Verizon to the extent it reflects
arms-length and fair market value terms as determined by Verizon in good
faith);

     | (ii) | nothing in this Agreement shall require Verizon or permit
Fleetmatics (without the prior written consent of Verizon) to litigate with
any Relevant Authority in connection with any Clearance under any Antitrust
Law;

     | (iii) | in no event shall Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries
be permitted to pay nor shall Verizon, Bidco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries be required to pay or permit Fleetmatics to pay any material fee,

under any applicable Antitrust Law, other than customary filing or application
fees in connection with any such Clearance; and

   7.3 | Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Verizon agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or
exculpation (including all limitations on personal liability) existing as of
the date of this Agreement in favour of each present and former director,
officer or 

---|---|--- 
 



76 for in their respective Organisational Documents or in any agreement to which
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall survive the consummation
of the Scheme and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Verizon
shall maintain in effect the provisions for indemnification, advancement of
expenses or exculpation in the Organisational Documents of Fleetmatics and
its Subsidiaries or in any agreement to which Fleetmatics or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors,
officers or employees of Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that
in the event any claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation is pending,
asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time or within such six year
period, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation
required to be continued pursuant to this Clause 7.3(a) in respect thereof
shall continue until disposition thereof. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | At and after the Effective Time, Fleetmatics shall (and
Verizon shall cause Fleetmatics to), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer or employee of Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries and each person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
together with his or her respective heirs and representatives, a "Fleetmatics
Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Fleetmatics Indemnified Parties")
against all costs and expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Fleetmatics Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in such persons capacity as a director, officer or employee of
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries or as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of
Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or before the Effective Time (including actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 
 



77 Verizon shall cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
maintained by Fleetmatics and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time (provided that Verizon may substitute therefor
(i) policies with a carrier with comparable credit ratings to the existing
carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less favourable to the insured as those provided by the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Existing
Policies") or (ii) a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" that covers those
persons who are currently covered by the Existing Policies for actions and
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and containing terms and
conditions that are no less favourable to the insured than those of the
Existing Policies); provided, however, that Verizon shall not be required to
pay aggregate premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by
Fleetmatics under the Existing Policies in respect of the coverages required
to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and in satisfaction of Verizons obligations under the immediately
preceding sentence, prior to the Effective Time, Fleetmatics may purchase
a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" under the Existing Policies; provided,
however, that Fleetmatics shall not be permitted to pay an amount in excess of
$950,000, subject to the adjustment set forth in Clause 7.3(c) of the
Fleetmatics Disclosure Schedule, for such "tail policy," but in such case may
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. If any
such prepaid tail policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
Verizon shall cause to be maintained such policy in full force and effect for
its full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Clause 7.3
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Organisational Documents of Fleetmatics
or any of its Subsidiaries, any insurance policy, the Act (or any other
applicable Law) or otherwise. The provisions of this Clause 7.3 shall survive
the consummation of the Acquisition and shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the
written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnified Parties shall be third, party beneficiaries of this
Clause 7.3 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this
Clause 7.3). 
---|---|--- 



   7.4 | Employment and Benefit Matters 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Verizon shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable,
that is no less favourable to such Fleetmatics Employee than the base salary
or wage rate provided to such Fleetmatics Employee as of immediately prior to
the Effective

78 doubt, equity and equity-based compensation) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, either (A) to those generally made available to
similarly situated Verizon employees under Verizons compensation and benefit
plans and programs, (B) to those provided to such Fleetmatics Employees as a
group immediately prior to the Effective Time or (C) any combination of
(A) and (B) as determined by Verizon. For the 2016 fiscal year of
Fleetmatics, Verizon shall continue, or cause to be continued, the same cash
bonus opportunity (performance metrics and target bonus as a percentage of
base compensation) as was provided to the applicable Fleetmatics Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Date. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Verizon shall provide that, for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate and, solely in respect of any severance or vacation
plan, level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Verizon
providing benefits to any Fleetmatics Employees after the Effective Time (the
"New Plans"), each Fleetmatics Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Fleetmatics Group and its predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Fleetmatics Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Fleetmatics Benefit Plan in which such Fleetmatics Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided
that the foregoing shall (i) not apply with respect to any benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare benefit plan, (ii)
not apply to the extent that would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service, (iii) not apply for purposes of any
plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of
Verizon and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y)
that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation, (iv) apply only with respect to the initial welfare benefit
plan of Bidco that a Fleetmatics Employee is eligible to participate in
immediately following the Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Fleetmatics Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable
coverage under a Fleetmatics Benefit Plan in which such Fleetmatics Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits (but not including any
disability benefits) to any Fleetmatics Employee, Verizon shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause (1) all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the
individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to
such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan. 
---|---|--- 
 



79 consultation obligations and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed to
any employees or consultants of Fleetmatics or any Subsidiary of Fleetmatics
in accordance with all applicable Laws and works council or other bargaining
agreements, if any. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Fleetmatics will provide Verizon with a copy of any written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to current or
former employees of Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries that relate
to Verizon or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
will provide Verizon with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such communications prior to distribution. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Fleetmatics
Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Verizon or any
Affiliate of Verizon, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Verizon or any affiliate of Verizon, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Fleetmatics
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Clause 7.4 shall (x) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other
modification of any Fleetmatics Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Verizon or any Affiliate of Verizon, or (y) create any third party rights in
any current or former service provider or employee of Verizon, Fleetmatics or
any of their respective Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | From and after the Effective Time, Verizon shall cause
Fleetmatics and its Subsidiaries to honour, in accordance with its terms, each
compensation, employment, severance, change-of-control and similar agreement
to which Fleetmatics or a Subsidiary of Fleetmatics is a party and that is
set forth in Clause 7.4(f) of the Fleetmatics Disclosure Schedule; provided
that such obligation is subject to any right of Verizon to amend or terminate
any such agreement in accordance with its terms. 
---|---|--- 



   7.5 | Tax Matters 
---|--- 

Verizon may, in its sole discretion, cause a timely and irrevocable election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any corresponding provisions of state or
local Tax law) to be made with respect to Fleetmatics and any or all of its
Subsidiaries which, in each case, is not a U.S. corporation.

 



   7.6 | Rule 16b-3 Actions 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Fleetmatics and Verizon shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause (a) any disposition of Fleetmatics Ordinary
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Fleetmatics Ordinary
Shares) resulting from the Acquisition and 

 



80  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Fleetmatics immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any
acquisitions of Verizon Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Verizon Shares) resulting from the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become or is
reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Verizon to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



   7.7 | Transaction Litigation 
---|--- 

Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, Fleetmatics shall control the defense of any litigation brought by
shareholders of Fleetmatics against Fleetmatics and/or its directors relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Acquisition;
provided, however, that subject to any fiduciary duties of the board of
directors of Fleetmatics or any of its Subsidiaries, Fleetmatics shall consult
and cooperate with Verizon in Fleetmatics defense or settlement of any such
litigation, and Fleetmatics agrees that it will not settle or compromise any
such litigation or propose any such settlement or compromise (other than any
settlement solely for monetary damages paid entirely from proceeds of
insurance, except for any applicable deductible) without the written consent
of Verizon.



   7.8 | Acquisition Implementation 
---|--- 

Verizon and Fleetmatics shall procure the consummation of the steps set out
on Schedule 7.8A in accordance therewith; provided, however, that if either
(i) Fleetmatics is unable to procure the auditors certificate as described in
Step 2.5 of Schedule 7.8A in a timely manner (as determined by Verizon in its
sole reasonable discretion), or (ii) Fleetmatics or one of its Subsidiaries is
unable to provide the indemnity to the directors of IrishCo described below,
then Verizon and Fleetmatics shall in lieu thereof procure the
consummation of the steps set out on Schedule 7.8B; provided further that
Verizon shall have the right to modify the steps set forth in such schedules
so long as such modifications (i) would not violate applicable Law, (ii) do
not require Fleetmatics to execute any agreements to implement the modified
steps unless the effectiveness of the actions to be taken under any such
agreements is conditioned on Completion, (iii) do not adversely affect the
right of the Fleetmatics Shareholders to receive the Cash Consideration in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iv) will not
otherwise prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of Verizon to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Acquisition). In recognition of the fact that the directors of IrishCo
will incur personal liability for the issuance of the declaration of solvency
in respect of IrishCo as described in Step 2.4 of Schedule 7.8A, (x) Verizon
hereby covenants that, from and after Completion, it will cause Fleetmatics
and its Subsidiaries to refrain from undertaking any actions to render IrishCo
insolvent within the twelve-month period immediately following the issuance of
such declaration of solvency, and (y) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Fleetmatics and/or one or more of its

 



81  Subsidiaries shall be permitted to provide such directors with an indemnity
for liabilities arising from the issuance of the declaration of solvency,
which indemnity shall be subject to standard and customary terms and
conditions, including exclusions for fraudulent conduct and actions taken in
bad faith. Except as expressly contemplated or permitted elsewhere in this
Agreement, or as set forth in Clause 5.1 of the Fleetmatics Disclosure
Schedule, or with the prior written consent of Verizon (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or condition) Fleetmatics covenants that
it will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Fleetmatics Deficit
will not exceed $15 million immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in
the event that Fleetmatics is unable to ensure (or in Verizons reasonable
opinion Fleetmatics is reasonably likely to be unable to ensure) that the
Fleetmatics Deficit is at or below $15 million, Fleetmatics will, prior to
the Effective Date, cooperate in good faith with Verizon to enable Verizon to
take all steps as are reasonably necessary in order to eliminate the
Fleetmatics Deficit by means of a reduction of share capital of Fleetmatics
immediately after the Effective Time and before the date on which the Cash
Consideration must be paid to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of
Section 8.1. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, (a)
the provision of sufficient information to reasonably enable the directors of
Fleetmatics after the Effective Time to swear a statutory declaration of
solvency to reduce the issued share capital of Fleetmatics by such amount as
is necessary to eliminate the Fleetmatics Deficit, (b) such reasonable
assistance to enable the provision of an auditors certificate required for
such reduction of capital, and (c) such waivers as may be required to be
provided to the Irish Companies Registration Office to enable the conversion
of Fleetmatics from a public to a private company within an expedited period
following the Effective Time, insofar as is reasonably possible. For the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with the above, and notwithstanding which
of the plans contained in Schedule 7.8A or Schedule 7.8B is used to consummate
the Transaction, Fleetmatics shall procure the filing with the Irish Companies
Registration Office of audited financials in respect of the financial year
ended 31 December 2015 for IrishCo as required under the Act in a timely
manner.



   7.9 | Fleetmatics Indebtedness 
---|--- 

Prior to the Completion Date, Fleetmatics shall obtain and deliver the Payoff
Letter to Verizon. Fleetmatics shall deliver (A) a draft of the Payoff Letter
to Verizon at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Completion Date (which draft, for the avoidance of doubt, may not include
the specific amounts to be paid on the Completion Date under the Credit
Agreement) and (B) an executed copy of the Payoff Letter in substantially
similar form prior to the anticipated Completion Date (which executed copy,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the specific amounts to be paid on
the Completion Date under the Credit Agreement). To the extent the Payoff
Letter does not include UCC-3 termination statements, Fleetmatics shall use
its reasonable best efforts to assist in the preparation of such termination
statements so they can be filed by Fleetmatics on the Completion Date.

sole discretion of the applicable Party, waiver (where applicable) of all of
the Conditions ("Completion Date") with the exception of Condition 2(d)

Fleetmatics or the Fleetmatics Group or any of their officers or employees, in
each case for breach of contract to hold office as a director, compensation
for loss of such office, redundancy or unfair dismissal or on any other
grounds in respect of the resignation; for the avoidance of doubt, any claims

including without limitation rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation, are expressly excluded from such acknowledgement); 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | share certificates in respect of the aggregate number of

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Fleetmatics shall cause an office copy of the Court Order
and a copy of the minute required by Section 86 of the Act to be filed with
the Companies Registration Office and obtain from the Registrar of Companies
a Certificate of Registration in relation to the reduction of share capital

benefit of the holders of Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares in the amount of such
losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or

entitled at the Effective Time to a right to receive the Cash Consideration
pursuant to Clause 8.1(c)(i), a letter of transmittal and instructions for use
in receiving the Cash Consideration. Each holder of record of such
Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive, within 14 days of
the Effective Time, the amount of cash payable in respect of the Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Clause
8.1(c)(i). Prior to the Completion, Bidco and Fleetmatics shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to establish procedures with the
Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") such that, assuming the
Effective Time occurs at the time of the Completion, the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominee no later than the first (1st) Business Day
after the Completion Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the number of shares of Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares held of record
by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Cash Consideration (such amount, the "DTC Payment"). No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of the Fleetmatics Ordinary
Shares on the Cash Consideration payable in respect of the Fleetmatics
Ordinary Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | _Termination of Fleetmatics Paying Agent Fund_. Any
portion of the Fleetmatics Paying Agent Fund which has not been transferred to
the holders of Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares as of the six-month anniversary
of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Bidco or its designee, upon
demand. Any holder of Fleetmatics Ordinary Shares who has not complied with
this Clause 8.1(d) prior to the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time
shall thereafter look only to Bidco for payment of such holders claim for
the Cash Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar applicable Laws). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _No Liability_. Neither Verizon nor Bidco nor Fleetmatics
nor the Paying Agent nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Cash Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
from the Fleetmatics Paying Agent Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



85 entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person who was a holder of a Fleetmatics Share subject to the
Scheme such amounts as Bidco or the Paying Agent may be required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Bidco or the Paying Agent with respect to any
Person and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, Bidco shall be
treated as having satisfied its obligation to deliver the Cash Consideration
in full to such Person by delivering the Cash Consideration net of such
withheld amounts and such Person shall not have any claim or entitlement with
respect to the Cash Consideration attributable to such withheld amounts.

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | by either Fleetmatics or Verizon, if the High Court
declines or refuses to sanction the Scheme, unless both Parties agree in

by Fleetmatics, if any Verizon Party shall have breached or failed to perform

     | (vi) | by Verizon, if Fleetmatics shall have breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements

forth in this Agreement are inaccurate, which breach, failure to perform or
inaccuracy (1) would (A) result in a failure of a Condition set forth in
Conditions 2, 3 or 4 or (B) give rise to a termination right under Clause
9.1(a)(ix) if it were to exist during the Pre-Sanction Period and (2) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if curable, Verizon
shall have given Fleetmatics written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior
to such termination, stating Verizons intention to terminate this Agreement

87 that are qualified by a Materiality Qualification were not true and correct
(without giving effect to any Materiality Qualification set forth therein) in
all respects at and as of the date hereof or shall not be true and correct

in all respects other than as would not materially impede or prevent the
consummation of the Acquisition at and as of the time of the notice of
termination delivered by Verizon during the Pre-Sanction Period pursuant to
this Clause 9.1(a)(ix)(D); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (E) | Fleetmatics shall have not in all material respects
performed all obligations and in all material respects complied with all

88 provided that with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) hereof,
representations and warranties that expressly relate to a particular date or
period shall be true and correct (in the manner set forth in clause (A), (B),

     | (xi) | by mutual written consent of Fleetmatics and Verizon. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Termination of this Agreement in accordance with Clause
9.1(a) shall not give rise to any liability of the Parties except as provided
in the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement or in the last sentence of

Agreement shall survive, and continue in full force and effect,
notwithstanding its termination. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Upon Verizon becoming entitled to a Verizon Reimbursement
Payment, neither Fleetmatics nor any of its Representatives or shareholders
shall have any further liability in connection with the termination of this

Agreement), whether under the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement or this
Agreement or otherwise, to Verizon, its Representatives or its shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement, no Party
shall be released from liability for Willful Breach, for fraud or as provided
for in the Confidentiality Agreement.

     | (d) | For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement
shall be without prejudice to the provisions of the Expenses Reimbursement

Relevant Authority (including, without limitation, the Panel). The Parties

10.1 do not apply to (a) any announcement, document or publication in
connection with a Fleetmatics Alternative Proposal or Fleetmatics Superior

   10.3 | Assignment

No Party shall assign all or any part of the benefit of, or rights
or benefits under, this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided that Verizon may assign any or all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its Subsidiaries, provided the prior
consent in writing has been obtained from the Panel in respect of such
assignment, but no such assignment shall relieve Verizon of its obligations
hereunder.



   10.4 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which,
taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement, and each Party
may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to
the other Party (by hand delivery, facsimile process, e-mail or otherwise).

 



   10.5 | Amendment 
---|--- 

No amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall
be evidenced in writing duly executed by each of the Parties, except that,
following approval by the Fleetmatics Shareholders, there shall be no
amendment to the provisions hereof which by applicable Law would require
further approval by the Fleetmatics Shareholders without such further
approval nor shall there be any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law.



   10.6 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement and any documents delivered by Verizon and Fleetmatics
in connection herewith (including the Verizon Disclosure Schedule and the
Fleetmatics Disclosure Schedule), constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between Verizon and Fleetmatics with respect to the subject matter hereof, it
being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. 



   10.7 | Inadequacy of Damages 
---|--- 

Each Party agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach
by it of this Agreement and accordingly each Party shall be entitled, without
proof of special damages, to the remedies of injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of
this Agreement.

 



92 ---|--- 

No delay or omission by either Party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall:



     | (a) | affect that right, power or remedy; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | operate as a waiver of it. 
---|---|--- 

The exercise or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by
Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or further exercise
of it or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



   10.9 | Severability 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this
Agreement or the Acquisition is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Relevant Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or, as appropriate,
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition, so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an equitable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible in accordance with applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties intend that the remedies and
limitations thereon contained in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Clauses 9.1(b), 9.1(c) and 9.1(d)) and the Expenses Reimbursement
Agreement shall be construed as integral parts of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and therefore shall not be severable in any
manner that increases or decreases a Partys liability or obligations
hereunder or thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If at any time any provision of this Agreement is or becomes
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any
jurisdiction, that shall not affect or impair: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the legality, validity or enforceability in that
jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the legality, validity or enforceability under the Law of
any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   10.10 | No Partnership and No Agency 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a
partnership, association, joint venture or other co-operative entity between
any of the Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, any
Party the agent of any other Party for any purpose. No Party has, pursuant to
this Agreement, any authority or power to bind or to contract in the name of
any other Party. 
---|---|--- 
 



93 ---|--- 

Without limitation to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, and
will procure that each member of their respective Groups will, issue, execute

necessary or desirable to facilitate the implementation of the Acquisition
or carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



   10.12 | Costs and Expenses 
---|--- 

Save for:

 



     | (a) | the Panels document review fees (which shall be borne and
discharged by Verizon), and 
---|---|---

with any Relevant Authorities under any Antitrust Laws (which shall be borne
and discharged by Verizon); 
---|---|--- 
 

each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses of and incidental to this
Agreement, the Acquisition and all other transactions contemplated hereby,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.



   10.13 | Governing Law and Jurisdiction 
---|--- 



     | (a) | This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules that would result in the application of the Laws of any
other jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Acquisition and the Scheme
and matters related thereto (including matters related to the Takeover Rules)
and matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the Fleetmatics Board shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of Ireland. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Each of Fleetmatics, Verizon and Bidco irrevocably agrees that the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom, or,
if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware does not have proper
jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware located
in Wilmington, Delaware, and any federal appellate courts therefrom, shall
have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Any proceeding, suit or action
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall therefore be
brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate
court therefrom, or, if the 

---|---|--- 
 



94 jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware located
in Wilmington, Delaware, and any federal appellate court therefrom.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Scheme and matters related to the sanction
thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court and any
appellate courts therefrom. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees (i) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such Action in any court other than as expressly
set forth in Clause 10.13(b) (including for the avoidance of doubt, by not
seeking to remove any such Action from the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware or any federal appellate courts therefrom unless the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware does not have proper jurisdiction),
(ii) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Action in any such courts, as applicable, (iii) that a final judgment in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law and (iv) that any
such Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of Ireland or the Laws of the State of Delaware, as expressly set forth in
Clause 10.13(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM). 
---|---|--- 



   10.14 | Third Party Beneficiaries 
---|--- 

Except as provided in Clause 7.3, this Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any person other than Fleetmatics and Verizon any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement.



   10.15 | Non Survival of Representations and Warranties 
---|--- 

None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive
the Completion or the termination of this Agreement.
