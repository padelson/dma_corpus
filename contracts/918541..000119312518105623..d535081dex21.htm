2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but not later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its good
faith calculation of an unaudited balance sheet of the Company, on a
consolidated basis, as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a
reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ " and, together with
the Post-Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Adjustment Statements_ ") setting
forth Purchasers calculations of the Closing Date Cash on Hand (the " _Post-
Closing Cash on Hand_ "), the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Post-
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), the Closing Date Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Post-Closing Closing Indebtedness_ ") and the Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses (the " _Post-Closing Company Transaction Expenses_ ").
The Post-Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
standards and principals required to be applied in preparing the Most Recent
Balance Sheet pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. Upon receipt of the Adjustment
Statements, Seller and its agents and representatives shall be given
reasonable on-site access to or copies of (as Seller shall request), for the
purpose of verifying the Adjustment Statements: (i) all of the books and
records, work papers, trial balances and other materials relating to the
Adjustment Statements and (ii) Purchasers and the Paragon Companies
personnel and accountants.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Adjustment Statements to
the Seller (the " _Protest Period_ "), the Seller may deliver written notice
(the " _Protest Notice_ ") to Purchaser of any objections that the Seller may
have to the Adjustment Statements. Such Protest Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the amount(s) in dispute and Sellers proposed amount(s);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such thirty (30) day period shall toll during
any time that Purchaser fails to comply with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_. Any line
item or amount not identified in the Protest Notice as in dispute shall be
deemed to be agreed upon, fixed and binding upon the Parties. If the Seller
does not deliver a Protest Notice to Purchaser within the Protest Period (or
applicable later date if such period is tolled), the Seller shall be deemed
to have agreed to the Adjustment Statements prepared and delivered by
Purchaser, and such Adjustment Statements (and the calculations therein) shall
be deemed to be final, non-appealable and binding upon the Parties.

(c) Upon receipt of a Protest Notice within the Protest Period, Purchaser
and the Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding
the Adjustment Statements. If Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve
any disagreement with respect to the Adjustment Statements within twenty (20)
days following Purchasers receipt of the Protest Notice, then such dispute
shall be submitted to the Chicago office of Duff and Phelps Corp., or, if such
firm is unable or unwilling to

 



   1  | To be substantially in the form of the draft RandW Insurance Policy
previously reviewed. 
---|--- 
 



14  be engaged for such purpose, then Purchaser and the Seller will mutually
select another independent accounting firm (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ ").
The Arbitrating Accountant will be instructed to send to Purchaser and the
Seller, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Arbitrating
Accountant is engaged with respect to such dispute, its determination on the
specific matters in dispute which shall be final, non-appealable and binding
on all Parties, absent fraud or manifest error, and shall be considered an
arbitral award for all purposes, and upon which a judgment may be entered by a
Court. The Arbitrating Accountant shall make such determination based solely
on the data presented by the Parties and not by independent review. The
Arbitrating Accountant shall be the sole arbiter of all matters, procedural or
substantive, as to such matters in dispute. Each of Purchaser and Seller
shall execute the Arbitrating Accountants standard engagement letter and fund
one-half (1/2) of its standard retainer, if applicable; provided, that the
total fees and costs of the Arbitrating Accountant for such determination
shall be paid by the Party whose calculation of the Purchase Price is farther
from the final calculation of the Purchase Price after taking into account the
determinations of the Arbitrating Accountant. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Arbitrating Accountant shall not make any determination for any amount other
than those still in dispute and, in each case, in accordance with the
definitions of Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Company Transaction
Expenses and Cash on Hand set forth herein. The Parties agree that the purpose
of the adjustment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ with respect to
Net Working Capital and Cash on Hand is to measure the amount of changes in
Net Working Capital and Cash on Hand using the same accounting methods,
policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments
and estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Statement, and such adjustment is not intended to permit the
introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the
purposes of determining Net Working Capital. The terms " _Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ ", " _Final Closing Date Cash on Hand_ ", " _Final Closing Date
Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses_ " and "
_Final Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ", as used in this Agreement, shall
mean the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Date Cash on Hand, Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Date Net
Working Capital, respectively, in each case, if deemed final in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ or the definitive Accounting Statements are
agreed to in writing by Seller and Purchaser or resulting from
the determinations made by the Arbitrating Accountant in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_.

 

(d) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the
Adjustment Statements:

 

(i) If the Final Closing Date Cash on Hand is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Cash on Hand, Purchaser shall pay such excess to the Seller as
provided by subsection (v) below. If the Final Closing Date Cash on Hand is
less than the Estimated Closing Date Cash on Hand, such deficit shall be paid
to Purchaser as provided by subsection (v) below. 

(ii) If the Final Closing Date Closing Indebtedness is less than the
Estimated Closing Date Closing Indebtedness, Purchaser shall pay such
difference to the Seller as provided by subsection (v) below. If the Final
Closing Date Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing Date
Closing Indebtedness, such difference shall be paid to Purchaser as provided
by subsection (v) below.

(iii) If the Final Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses are less
than the Estimated Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, Purchaser shall
pay such difference to the Seller as provided by subsection (v) below. If the
Final Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses are greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, such difference shall be paid to
Purchaser as provided by subsection (v) below.

 



15 (iv) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than
the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay such
excess to the Seller as provided by subsection (v) below. If the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital, such deficit shall be paid to Purchaser as provided by subsection
(v) below.

(v) Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7(d)(_ _i_ _)_ through (iv) __ shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if
any) owed by Purchaser to the Seller, on the one hand, or by the Seller to
Purchaser, on the other hand, is referred to as the " _Final Adjustment
Amount_ "; it being understood and agreed that if the net effect pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(v)_ is an increase in the Purchase Price, then
Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Seller an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment Amount, and if the net
effect pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(v)_ is a decrease in the
Purchase Price, then the Seller shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Purchaser an amount equal to such deficit. The Final
Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
Income Tax purposes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the dollar amount of the Target Closing Date Net Working Capital
be subject to adjustment for any reason in connection with any calculation
under this _Article II_ or otherwise.

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of

fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

delivery by each of Purchaser and Parent of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents to which each is a party or any instrument required by
this Agreement to be executed and delivered by it on or prior to the Closing
do not, and the performance of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents to which each is a party and any instrument required by this
Agreement to be executed and delivered by it on or prior to the Closing will
not, (a) conflict with, require a consent or notice under or violate the
Governing Documents of such Person, (b) conflict with, require a consent or
notice under or violate any Law or Order applicable to such Person or by which
any of its properties, rights or assets are bound or affected or (c) result
in any material breach or violation of, require a consent or notice under, or

pursuant to, any Contract to which such Person is a party, or by which

hereby.

 

5.4 _Absence of Litigation, Claims and Orders_. As of the date hereof,
there are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened on behalf of or against Purchaser or Parent that (i) challenges (a)
the validity of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which
Purchaser or Parent is a party or (b) any action taken or to be taken by
Purchaser or Parent pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Documents to which Purchaser or Parent is a party or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) would be reasonably
likely to impair or delay the transactions contemplated hereby or the ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchasers or Parents performance
under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

5.5 _Investment Intent_. Purchaser is acquiring the Capital Stock for its
own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to their
distribution within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act.
Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in
the Capital Stock, and Purchaser is capable of bearing the economic risks of
such investment, including a complete loss of its investment in the
Capital Stock. Purchaser acknowledges that the Capital Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act, or any state or foreign securities Laws,
and understands and agrees that it may not sell or dispose of any of the
Capital Stock except pursuant to a registered offering in compliance with, or
in a transaction exempt from, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and any other applicable state, foreign or federal securities Laws.

 

5.6 _Brokers_. Other than SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, there is no broker,
financial advisor, finder or investment banker or other Person entitled to
any brokers, financial advisors, finders or other fee or commission, or any
other payment or other amount, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Purchaser or Parent.

5.7 _Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy_. Purchaser has
delivered to Seller a true, accurate and complete copy of the binder agreement
for the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy and the form of the Purchaser RandW
Insurance Policy. The binder agreement for the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy
is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Purchaser, and to the knowledge of Purchaser, the insurer(s)
party thereto, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and except insofar as the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by applicable Law.

 



41 5.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser has, and will on the Closing Date have, sufficient
unrestricted cash on hand and available credit facilities to pay all amounts
required to be paid by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and all of its and its representatives fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser has delivered to Seller true, accurate and complete copies of
a fully executed Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof from each of
the Debt Financing Sources, relating to the commitment of the Debt Financing
Sources, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, with
respect to the Debt Financing for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, there
are (i) no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources to provide the full amount of the Debt Financing Commitment (provided,
that Purchaser is not making any representation or warranty regarding
the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Articles_ __ _ III_ and _IV_ , or compliance by the Seller Parties with
their obligations hereunder); and (ii) no side letters, agreements, contracts
or other arrangements related to the Debt Financing (except for the "market
flex" provisions redacted from the Redacted Fee Letter) that could impose new
or additional conditions precedent or reduce the aggregate amount of
cash proceeds available under the Debt Financing (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the conditions precedent set forth herein). Other than the
Debt Financing Commitment, there are no other Contracts or other undertakings
between any Debt Financing Source Party, on the one hand, and Purchaser and
its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the Debt Financing that
could adversely affect (A) the ability of Purchaser to satisfy any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing or (B) the availability of the Debt
Financing.

(d) As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment (i) is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Purchaser, and to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources, as
applicable, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and except insofar as the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by applicable Law, and (ii) has not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect prior
to the date of this Agreement, and no amendment or modification thereof is
contemplated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as of the date of this
Agreement. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are payable on or prior
to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, neither Purchaser, nor to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party to the Debt Financing Commitment is
in default or breach of the Debt Financing Commitment. Assuming the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ are satisfied, as of the date hereof
Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment will not
be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to timely
satisfy the aggregate consideration payable by Purchaser on the Closing Date
pursuant to  _Article II_ and all costs and expenses required to be paid by
Purchaser at the Closing.

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of the Debt Financing by
Purchaser or any Affiliate or any other financing be a condition to any of
Purchasers obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.9 _Solvency_. Immediately following the Closing, and after giving effect
to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Paragon Companies will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_,
" _Solvent_ " means that, with respect to any Person and as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person, will, as of such date, exceed the amount of all
"liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise," as of such date,

 



42  as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) the
present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the liability of
such Person on its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes absolute and
matured, (c) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital with which to conduct its business and (d) such Person
will be able to pay its indebtedness as it matures. For purposes of the
foregoing definition only, "indebtedness" means a liability in connection
with another Persons (x) right to payment, whether or not such a right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured
or (y) right to any equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach
gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Financing

maintain the Debt Financing Commitment in effect in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof; (B) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
substantially as set forth therein or as set forth in any documents related to

Companys failure to furnish information or assistance described in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_); (D) draw down on and consummate the Debt Financing
if the conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing have been
satisfied or waived, including using its reasonable best efforts to enforce

Financing and (E) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the
availability of the Debt Financing applicable to it in such definitive
agreements that are within its control (other than any condition where the
failure to so satisfy is a result of the Companys failure to
furnish information or assistance described in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_). If
any portion of the Debt Financing expires or terminates or otherwise becomes
unavailable, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
arrange for and obtain alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and perform all of its obligations hereunder on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable or more onerous (including
imposition of new conditions or expansion of existing conditions) to
Purchaser, in the aggregate, than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, it being understood that if Purchaser proceeds with any
Alternative Financing, Purchaser shall be subject to the same obligations with
respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing.

 

(c) Purchaser shall not replace, amend or waive the Debt Financing
Commitment or any provision thereof without Sellers prior written consent if
such replacement, amendment or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected
to, when taken together with any other amendments, waivers: (i) delay or
prevent the Closing; (ii) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur; (iii) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated at the Closing;
(iv) reduce (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing
unless (x) the Debt Financing or the equity financing by Purchaser is
increased by a corresponding amount, (y) the Debt Financing is otherwise made
available to fund such fees or original issue discount or (z) such reduction
does not cause the aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing to be insufficint
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby); or (v) impose new
conditions precedent or adversely expand, amend or modify any of the existing
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise add,
expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Debt Financing Commitment,
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions precedent
to the Debt Financing) at the Closing. Upon any permitted amendment,
supplement, modification or replacement of the Debt Financing Commitment
(including with respect to any Alternative Financing) in

 



48  accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, the term " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ " shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment as so amended,
supplemented, modified or replaced, and references to "Debt Financing" and/or
"Alternative Financing" shall including the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment as so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced and
references to "Debt Financing Sources" and "Debt Financing Source Parties"
shall include the lenders under any amended, supplemented, modified or
replaced Debt Financing Commitment or Debt Financing.

 

(d) Purchaser shall provide Seller prompt (but in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) notice (i) upon becoming aware of any material breach,
default, repudiation, cancellation or termination (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach,
default, repudiation, cancellation or termination) by any party to the Debt
Financing Commitment or such other agreements or documents (including any
definitive agreements) relating to the Debt Financing or any termination of
the Debt Financing Commitment or such other agreements or documents
(including any definitive agreements) relating to the Debt Financing, (ii)
upon receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, agents or representatives
of any written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing
Source of any material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination of the Debt Financing Commitment, and (iii) if for any reason
Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing and such inability could reasonably be
expected to impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days after the date Seller delivers Purchaser a
written request, Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested
by Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or
_(iii)_ of the immediately preceding sentence. In addition, Purchaser shall,
upon reasonable request of Seller, keep Seller informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain
the Debt Financing and provide to Seller copies of all executed material
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing. 

(e) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Paragon Companies and
Seller and their respective agents, representatives and Affiliates from and
against all actual out of pocket Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the performance by the Paragon Companies or Seller of their
covenants under  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_, except for any of the foregoing to
the extent the same is the result of fraud committed by the Paragon Companies
and/or Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Losses for purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ shall not include any punitive, special, indirect,
exemplary or consequential damages, damages for lost profits, damages for
diminution in value or business interruption or damages computed on a multiple
of earnings or similar basis. Such indemnification shall be subject to the
procedures set forth in _Article X_. Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by
Seller, reimburse any Paragon Company or Seller for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Paragon Company or Seller in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_.

 

6.7 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all of the conditions precedent to Purchasers
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and the Seller Parties
obligations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ to be satisfied.

be extended to August 30, 2018); provided that, in each case, the Party

Party may not enforce this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ if such Party has
materially breached any provision of this Agreement;

 



51 (c) by Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by the

respects by the Company or the Seller within the earlier of (i) thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Seller of written notice thereof from Purchaser or
(ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the End Date; provided that Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ if it is then in breach of this Agreement;

 

(d) by the Seller, if there has been a violation or breach by Purchaser of

Company at the Closing not to be satisfied, and such violation or breach has
not been waived by the Seller or cured in all material respects by Purchaser
within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of

provided further, that the Seller shall not have the right to terminate this

ARTICLE VIII.

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

8.1 _Further Assurances; Litigation Support_.

 

(a) In case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents).

 

(b) Following the Closing, in the event and for so long as Purchaser is
involved in contesting or defending against any Proceeding involving the
Paragon Companies in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action,

 



52  Tax matter, failure to act, or transaction occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and
Purchasers counsel in such involvement, contest or defense, and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be necessary in
connection with such contest or defense, all at the sole reasonable cost and
expense of Purchaser (except to the extent that Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification therefor hereunder)

(c) Following the Closing, in the event and for so long as the Seller is
involved in contesting or defending against any Proceeding involving the
Paragon Companies in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, Tax matter, failure to act, or transaction occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Paragon Companies to,
cooperate reasonably with the Seller and the Sellers counsel in such
involvement, contest or defense, and provide such testimony and access to its
books and records as shall be necessary in connection with such contest or
defense, all at the sole reasonable cost and expense of the Seller (except to
the extent that the Seller is entitled to indemnification therefor
hereunder).

8.2 _Non-Solicitation;  Confidentiality_.

(a) The Seller acknowledges that it is familiar with the Trade Secrets and
other confidential information of the Paragon Companies, and that the
business of the Paragon Companies is reasonably expected to operate throughout
the world. Therefore, the Seller agrees to the covenants set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and acknowledges that Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement but for the Sellers agreement to the restrictions set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

 

(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date (the "
_Non-Solicitation Restricted Period_"), the Seller shall not, and the Seller
shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, hire, engage, or
solicit for employment (or engagement as a consultant) any individual (other
than Steve Meyer) who was employed (or engaged as a consultant but effectively
functioned as an employee) by any Paragon Company during the one (1) year
period prior to Closing, or encourage or induce or attempt to encourage or
induce any such employee or consultant to leave such employment or engagement,
except that the foregoing prohibition on solicitation shall not prohibit a
general solicitation by means of general advertisement which is
not specifically directed at such employees or consultants or the hiring of
any individual whose employment or engagement with the Paragon Companies has
been terminated for a period of at least six (6) months prior to any
solicitation of employment discussion with Seller or its Affiliates.

(c) During the Non-Solicitation Restriction Period, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, representatives and agents to, hold in confidence
(and not disclose or provide access to any other Person) and not use, any and
all confidential or proprietary information, whether written or oral,
concerning the Paragon Companies, except to the extent that such information:
(i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents; or (ii) was
lawfully acquired by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, representatives or
agents from and after the Closing from sources unrelated to Purchaser, the
Paragon Companies or the Seller which, to Sellers knowledge, are
not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal or contractual
obligation. If the Seller or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents
is compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of Law, the Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser
in writing. Subject to Sellers consultation with its legal counsel that
compliance with Sellers obligations in this sentence would not materially
prejudice its position or defense, and prior to the disclosure of any such
information, Seller will consult with Purchaser as to whether Purchaser
intends to take legally available steps to resist or narrow such request. It
is further agreed that if, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is nonetheless, after consultation with
its legal counsel, compelled to disclose or produce such confidential or
proprietary information, Seller may 

 



53  disclose or produce only that portion of such information to any
Governmental Authority as its counsel believes is legally required.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to use confidential and
proprietary information of the Paragon Companies solely in connection with
their confidential Tax or accounting purposes, legal compliance, or to enforce
their respective rights under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ shall not apply to Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to any information of a nature that would typically be provided by
private equity funds with respect to their prior portfolio companies to
investors or prospective investors.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Purchaser and each of its
Affiliates, successors, and assigns would suffer irreparable harm from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by the Seller and that money damages would
not be an adequate remedy for any such breach. Therefore, in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Purchaser and each
of its Affiliates or their respective successors and assigns, in addition to
other rights and remedies available at Law or in equity, shall be entitled to
specific performance, injunctive, and other equitable relief in order to
enforce or prevent any breach of the provisions of this Agreement without
posting a bond or other security. The restrictive covenants set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be construed as agreements independent of any
other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of
action of the Seller against Purchaser, whether predicated upon this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or otherwise, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by Purchaser of any restrictive covenant contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. Purchaser has fully performed all obligations
entitling it to the restrictive covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
8.2_, and such restrictive covenants therefore are not executory or otherwise
subject to rejection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code.

 

(e) If the final judgment of a Court declares any term or provision of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ to be invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that
the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to reduce the scope or duration, of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified to
cover the maximum duration, scope or area permitted by Law. The Seller, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, representatives and agents, agrees that
the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are reasonable and
necessary to protect Purchasers legitimate business interests and the
Companys goodwill purchased pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.

 

8.3 _Publicity_. The Seller and the Purchaser will consult with each other
and will mutually agree upon any press release with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release prior to such consultation and agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein will limit any party from making (or require
the other Partys consent to) any announcements, statements or acknowledgments
that such Party is required by applicable Law to make, issue or release.

 

8.4 _Distribution of Purchase Price Proceeds_ _; Holdback_.

 

(a) The Seller agrees not to distribute any Purchase Price proceeds to any
holder of equity interests of the Seller (each, a " _Member_ ") in respect
of, or payable in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless and until such Member (or another Member on such Members
behalf) executes and delivers to the Seller and Purchaser an Indemnification
Agreement, and the Seller further acknowledges and agrees that any such
Purchase Price proceeds held by the Seller after the Closing Date and prior to
the execution of an Indemnification Agreement by such Member (or on such
Members behalf) shall be available to satisfy the Sellers indemnification
obligations under this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_.

 



54 (b) The Seller agrees to retain, and not distribute from the
Estimated Purchase Price to any Member, the Holdback Amount to fund the
Sellers payment obligations, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)(v)_.
Within three (3) Business Days following the final determination of the
Adjustment Statements pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and, if payment is due
from Seller thereunder, the payment of any amounts so due, Seller shall be
permitted to distribute the Holdback Amount to the Members, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_.

8.5 _Access to Books and Records_. Purchaser shall maintain until the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date all books and records relating
to any Paragon Company or any asset or liability of any Paragon Company prior
to the Closing in the manner such books and records are maintained immediately
prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Seller
and its agents and representatives with reasonable access, upon prior
reasonable written request, during regular business hours, to (a) the officers
and employees of the Paragon Companies and (b) the books and records, but, in
each case, only to the extent relating to the assets, liabilities or business
of any Paragon Company prior to the Closing, and Seller and its agents and
representatives shall have the right to make copies of such books and records
at its sole cost.

8.6 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_.

(a) For a period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Closing
Date, the Governing Documents of each Paragon Company shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of current or former directors and officers of any
Paragon Company (each, a " _Covered Party_ ") than are currently set forth in
their respective Governing Documents. Any indemnification agreements with
Covered Parties in existence on the date of this Agreement shall remain
effective, without any further action, and shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Paragon Companies shall obtain a
non-cancelable run-off insurance policy for directors and officers
liability, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date to provide
insurance coverage for events, acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date, including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, for all persons who were directors, managers or officers
of Seller or any Paragon Company, as applicable, on or prior to the Closing
Date (the " _D andO Insurance_"). Purchaser shall cause any Paragon Company, as
applicable, to maintain the DandO Insurance in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event Purchaser or any Paragon Company (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing entity after such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that each Covered Party maintains the protections
set forth in Section 8.6(a) and (b) to the same extent as Parents executive
management employees maintain similar protections.

8.7 _No Additional Representations_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that none of Seller, the Paragon Companies, any of their Affiliates or any
agents or representatives of any of the foregoing has made or will be deemed
to have made (and Purchaser and its Affiliates have not relied on) (a) any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Seller, the Paragon Companies or
their respective businesses or assets, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any information contained in the Confidential Information

 



55  Memorandum prepared by William Blair or any projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Paragon
Companies and any business plan information of the Paragon Companies) except
as expressly set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and qualified by the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

8.8 _R andW Policy_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not amend, waive or
otherwise modify the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, in any manner that would
allow the insurer thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or otherwise
make or bring any Proceeding against Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or any
past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee or advisor of
any of the foregoing based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

 

8.9 _Data Room Flash Drive or Memory Stick_. No later than five (5)
Business Days after Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a flash drive
or memory stick containing the complete contents of the Project Phoenix
virtual data room.

 

8.10 _Buck Note_. Upon the payment in full of the Buck Note, whether by
payment in cash or by setoff against the payments to which Seller is entitled
pursuant to _Article II_ , the Buck Note, the Buck Security Pledge Agreement
and all Liens of Paragon Medical, Inc. affecting any real or personal property
of Tobias W. Buck will be released. If payment in full of the Buck Note is
not made at or prior to the Closing, then upon the receipt by Paragon Medical,
Inc. of any payment with respect to the Buck Note, whether by payment in cash
or by setoff against amounts due to Tobias W. Buck, Purchaser shall cause
Paragon Medical, Inc. to promptly remit the amount of such payment, along with
a reasonable description of such payment, to Seller.

 

8.11 _Interest Rate Agreement_. Upon the receipt following the Closing by
any Paragon Company of any payment with respect to the Interest Rate
Agreement, Purchaser shall cause such Paragon Company to promptly remit the
amount of such payment, along with a reasonable description of such payment,
to Seller.

 

8.12 _Deregistration of Liens in Poland_. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser and the Paragon Companies for all
actual out of pocket Losses incurred on or after Closing by them in connection
with the deregistration of certain prior liens with the applicable registry
courts in Poland on the real property held by, and equity securities of,
Paragon Siechnice Sp. Z o.o., which liens arose in connection with, and were
released by Citizens Bank in connection with the payoff and termination on May
22, 2017 of, that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2013, by
and among certain Paragon Companies, the lenders and loan parties from time to
time identified as parties thereto and Citizens Bank, National Association, as
administrative agent; provided, however, that Losses for purposes of this
Section 8.12 shall not include any punitive, special, indirect, exemplary or
consequential damages, damages for lost profits, damages for diminution in
value or business interruption or damages computed on a multiple of earnings
or similar basis.

 



56 ARTICLE IX.

 

TAX MATTERS

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Purchaser and the Seller for certain Tax matters following the
Closing:

 

9.1 _Income Tax Treatment; Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed on
behalf of the Paragon Companies, when due (taking into account any extensions
of a required filing date) all Tax Returns of the Paragon Companies first due
(taking into account all applicable extensions) after the Closing Date for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle
Period), if any (each a " _Purchaser-Filed Tax Return_ "). Any items described
in the definition of Transaction Tax Deductions shall be deducted for income
tax purposes on the Tax Returns of the Paragon Companies for the U.S. federal
income tax period ending on the Closing Date and, accordingly, shall be for
the benefit of the Seller, and the Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Paragon Companies shall make the election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29
with respect to the U.S. federal income tax period ending on the Closing Date
to apply the seventy percent (70%) safe harbor to any "success-based fee"
as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.263(a)-5(f). Purchaser shall
cause the Paragon Companies to claim as a refund any overpayment of Taxes
reflected on any Purchaser-Filed Tax Return that reflects an overpayment of
Taxes. " _Transaction Tax Deductions_ " means, without duplication, any (A)
transaction bonuses, change in control payments, severance payment, retention
payments, or similar payments made to employees or other service providers of
the Paragon Companies, (B) fees, expenses, and interest (including unamortized
original issue discount and any other amounts treated as interest for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes and any prepayment penalty or breakage fees or
accelerated deferred financing fees) incurred by the Paragon Companies in
connection with the repayment of any indebtedness, (C) the amount of
investment banking, legal and accounting fees and expenses paid or payable by
the Paragon Companies, and (D) the amount of any deductions for federal
income Tax purposes as a result of the exercise or payment for cancellation of
employee or other compensatory options, in each case arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall submit each Purchaser-Filed Tax Return (i) that is
an Income Tax Return, (ii) reflecting a liability of $50,000 or more or (iii)
for which Purchaser will seek indemnification under this Agreement (together
with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably requested,
supporting documentation) to the Seller at least thirty (30) days (or, in the
case of any Tax Return that is not an Income Tax Return, a reasonable number
of days, but at least ten (10) days) prior to the due date (including any
applicable extension) of such Tax Return. The Seller shall have the right to
review and comment on such Purchaser-Filed Tax Return. If the Seller, within
ten (10) Business Days (or, in the case of any Tax Return that is not an
Income Tax Return, three (3) Business Days) after receipt of any such
Purchaser-Filed Tax Return, notifies Purchaser in writing that it objects to
any items in such Tax Return, the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner
mutually agreeable to the Parties within ten (10) Business Days (or, in the
case of any Tax Return that is not an Income Tax Return, two (2) Business
Days), and if not so resolved, then by the Arbitrating Accountant within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return.
In the event such Tax Return becomes due while being resolved by the
Arbitrating Accountant, such Tax Return shall be filed reflecting Purchasers
position on any disputed items. Upon resolution of all such items,
the relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted (and amended, if applicable) to
reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the Parties without further
adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of the accounting firm shall be borne
by the Party whose position is not adopted by such accounting firm.

(c) Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to any
Purchaser-Filed Tax Return filed under _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_. The Seller
shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to any Taxes imposed for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which Seller has an indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and which are reflected as due on any
Purchaser-Filed Tax Return and as finally delivered by Purchaser to Seller
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ prepared in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, to the extent not paid at or before the Closing or
included in the calculation of Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, within
two (2) days prior to the latest date on which such Taxes are due and payable
without interest or penalties.

 



57 9.2 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Paragon Companies for
any Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Paragon Companies
for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including, and the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be
determined by assuming that such Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable
years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the
other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Paragon Companies for
such Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Paragon Companies were closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided,
however, periodic Taxes (other than income, franchise/capital, sales, use,
payroll or withholding Taxes) such as real and personal property Taxes, shall
be apportioned ratably between such periods based on the number of days for
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date,
on the one hand, and the number of days for the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date, on the other hand. Any items
described in the definition of Transaction Tax Deductions shall be reflected
in the portion of any applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 

9.3 _Certain Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate (including the
Paragon Companies after the Closing) to, (i) except upon the Sellers written
request file, re-file, supplement or amend any Tax Return of the Paragon
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) except upon the Sellers prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, voluntarily approach any Taxing Authority regarding any Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Paragon Companies that were originally due on or before the
Closing Date, (iii) make an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any
comparable applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) take any
action relating to Taxes or that would be reasonably likely to create a Tax
liability on the Closing Date (other than as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement) that is outside the ordinary course of business, or (v) except in
connection with a Purchaser-Filed Tax Return, or upon the Sellers written
request, carryback any net operating loss to a Pre-Closing tax Period.

 

(b) Except to the extent taken into account as an asset in the calculation
of Closing Date Net Working Capital, any Tax refund (and any credit in lieu
of such refund) received by Purchaser or the Paragon Companies that is for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of any of the Paragon Companies, shall be for the
account of the Seller. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid any such
refund or credit, net of all out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes) imposed on
Purchaser or the Paragon Companies with respect to such refund, to the Seller
as additional consideration for the Capital Stock within five (5) days after
receipt thereof.

 

(c) Parent will cause the eligible Paragon Companies to join its
"consolidated group" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-1(h)) effective as of the beginning of the date following the Closing
Date and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat the Closing
Date as the last date of a Tax period of such Paragon Company (the " _Agreed
Tax Treatment_ "). Each Party shall file all Tax Returns consistently with the
Agreed Tax Treatment and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith.

 

9.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article
IX_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding, signing Tax

 



58  Returns and making employees available to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Any information obtained
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ or pursuant to any other Section
hereof providing for the sharing of information or review of any Tax Return or
other schedule relating to Taxes with respect to the Paragon Companies shall
be kept confidential by the Parties and their respective legal and tax
advisors.

9.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the transfer of the Capital Stock to
Purchaser shall be split equally by Purchaser and the Seller.

 

ARTICLE X.

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The Fundamental
Representations and the Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(iii)_ of this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date
and expire on the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that all other representations and warranties shall not survive
beyond the Closing. The period of time, if any, that a covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty survives the Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 10.1_ shall be the " _Survival Period_ " with respect to such covenant,
agreement, representation or warranty. None of the covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing other than
those which by their terms expressly contemplate performance after the
Closing (such covenants, the " _Post-Closing Covenants_ "), and each such
surviving covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing for the period
contemplated by its terms, and if no such term is contemplated, then
indefinitely. The right to indemnification, reimbursement, or other remedy, if
any, based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) about, the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation.

 

10.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ X_, from
and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Paragon Companies) and their
respective representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the " _Purchaser
Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons for, any and all Losses incurred by them arising out of or
resulting from any of the following matters:

 

(i) the breach of any Fundamental Representation;

 

(ii) the nonfulfillment or breach by any Seller Party of any of its Post-
Closing Covenants (including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and _Section_
__ _ 8.12_); _provided_ , _however_ , that any indemnification for the
nonfulfillment or breach by any Seller Party of any of its Post-Closing
Covenants set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ shall be subject to such
limitations and restrictions as are set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.12_; and

 

(iii) any Income Taxes of the Paragon Companies for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (and not otherwise accounted for in the calculation of the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital); provided, that, Purchaser shall have no
right to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to, or based on,
Taxes to the extent such Taxes (i) are attributable to Tax periods (or
portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (except as a result of a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 3.15(h)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.15(k)(ii)_), (ii) are
due to the unavailability in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax
attribute from a Pre-Closing Tax Period, 

 



59  (iii) result from transactions or actions taking by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Paragon Companies) after the Closing that are not
expressly contemplated by this Agreement and that are out of the ordinary
course of business, (iv) do not arise from a Third-Party Claim, or (v) result
from any Purchaser financing transaction.

 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ X_, from
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
and its respective Affiliates (excluding the Paragon Companies) and
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the " _Seller Indemnified
Persons_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified
Persons for, any Losses incurred by them arising out of or resulting from any
of the following matters:

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement;

 

(ii) the nonfulfillment or breach by Purchaser of any of its Post-Closing
Covenants (including pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_); and

(iii) any brokerage or finders fees or commissions or similar payments
based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any
such Person with Purchaser (or any Person acting on its behalf) in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

10.3 _Calculation of Losses; Determination of Application_. For the
purposes of calculating Losses to which any Indemnified Party (as defined
below) is entitled under this _Article X_ , (i) such Losses shall not include
any punitive, exemplary or speculative damages except to the extent paid or
payable to a third party as a result of any Third-Party Claim; (ii) such
Losses shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the
state of facts giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; (iii) such Losses shall not
include duplicative Losses related to any matter that was taken into account
(including with respect to any reserves) in the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_; (iv) such Losses shall
be reduced by the amount of any prior or subsequent recovery by the
Indemnified Party from any other Person (other than from Purchaser in the case
of a Seller Indemnified Person or a Seller Party in the case of a Purchaser
Indemnified Person) with respect to such Losses (in each case, net of any
costs of recovery); provided that in the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder (including pursuant to the
Purchaser Representation and Warranty Insurance), then a refund equal to the
lesser of (A) the amount of such recovery (net of costs of recovery) and (B)
the amount of indemnification so paid, shall be made promptly to the
Indemnifying Party; and (v) such Losses shall be limited to the amount of any
liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim; _provided_ ,
that any amounts received pursuant to making an insurance claim shall be
offset by any Losses related to making such claim, including the payment of
any deductible and the net present value of any increases in premium payments
as a result of such claim, and the Losses shall be measured by the amount, if
any, by which the Losses from making the claim exceed the insurance proceeds
actually received.

10.4 _No Double Materiality_. For purposes determining whether a
representation or warranty has been breached and for purposes of calculating
the amount of Losses to which any Purchaser Indemnified Person or any Seller
Indemnified Person is entitled under this _Article X_ , the terms "material,"
"materiality," and "material adverse effect" will be disregarded; provided,
however, that such qualification shall not be read out of any defined term
that incorporates such materiality qualification (e.g., "Material Contract"
or Material Supplier") and not apply to (x) _ Sections 3.1_ or (y) the first
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.10_.

 



60 10.5 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The indemnification
obligations provided for in _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
10.2(b)_ are subject to the following limitations and qualifications:

 

(a) The maximum aggregate indemnification obligation of the Seller under 
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)(iii)_ other than
any claim based upon fraud in the making of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ , shall not exceed an amount
equal to $37,500,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

(b) The maximum aggregate indemnification obligation of the Purchaser
under _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ , other than any claim based upon
fraud in the making of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article V_ , shall not exceed an amount equal to the Cap.

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which such
Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected
to, or does, give rise thereto. If any Losses sustained by a Purchaser
Indemnified Persons are covered by an insurance policy (including the
Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy) or an indemnification, contribution or similar
obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Purchaser
Indemnified Person), such Purchaser Indemnified Person shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments.

 

10.6 _Indemnification Procedures_. The following procedures shall govern
claims for indemnification under this _Article X_ :

(a) In order for a Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this _Article X_ in respect of a claim
made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a Party to this
Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify
the indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") and, to the
extent applicable, the Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider, in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim describing in reasonable detail such claim
and the nature and amount of such Loss, to the extent that the nature and
amount thereof are reasonably determinable at such time, and a reasonable
description of known relevant facts with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party provides a written notice to the Indemnified
Party within twenty (20) days after its receipt of written notice of such
Third-Party Claim that it indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless
from all Losses subject to indemnification under this Article X (giving effect
to any limitations or restrictions set forth herein), the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party) to assume the defense and control of such Third-Party Claim or any
Proceeding with a third party resulting therefrom; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or litigation shall be subject to the approval of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect by such written notice to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof for so long as the
Indemnifying Party is defending such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the
terms hereof, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, in each case at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party (it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense). Provided that prompt 

 



61  notice was provided of such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.6(a)
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
for any period prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of the
defense of such claim shall constitute Loss and be subject to indemnification
under this Article X (giving effect to any limitations or restrictions set
forth herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of
the defense against a Third-Party Claim if: (i) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation, or investigation; (ii) the claim
for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation, or investigation pursuant to Environmental
Law; (iii) the claim seeks an injunction, specific performance, or any other
equitable or non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party; (iv) the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party such
that the Indemnified Party cannot fairly represent the interests of the
Indemnified Party in the defense of such claim; (v) the Indemnifying Party
fails to reasonably demonstrate to the Indemnified Party that it (or in the
case that the Indemnifying Party is Seller, that Members responsible for at
least 75% of Sellers indemnification obligations hereunder) has
the financial ability to satisfy all Third-Party Claims; or (vi) the party
bringing the claim is a customer or supplier of the Indemnified Party or the
claims relate to employee or regulatory matters (excluding any matters related
to Taxes). If the Indemnifying Party does not accept the defense of a Third-
Party Claim within twenty (20) days after receipt of the written notice
thereof from the Indemnified Party described above (or if the Indemnifying
Party is not permitted to assume the defense of the claim pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend against and control any such claim; provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and provided,
however, that the counsel for the Indemnified Party who shall conduct the
defense of such claim or litigation.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
good faith in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, including
making available (subject to applicable confidentiality provisions in this
Agreement) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. The Party controlling any Third-Party Claim shall reasonably promptly
provide to any other Party, upon request, a status update, and a copy of all
relevant material correspondence with the claimant or its representatives,
all relevant material court filings and all other material documents
reasonably requested by such other Party, regarding any pending Third-Party
Claim.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or discharge any
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party
shall not settle, compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this _Article_ __ _ X_ that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in any event
within 10 Business Days of becoming aware of any facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification
hereunder, deliver a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the
Indemnifying Party and, to the extent such Claim is covered by the Purchaser
RandW Insurance Policy, to the Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider. The failure by
any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Party under this  _Article_ __ _ X_, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its books and
records (and, if the Seller is the Indemnifying

 



62  Parties, the Paragon Companies books and records) during normal business
hours for the purpose of allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable
opportunity to verify any such claim for Damages. If the Indemnifying Party
timely disputes its liability with respect to such claim as provided above,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve such dispute.

 

(f) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall satisfy its obligations to the Indemnified Party within fifteen
(15) Business Days of such agreement or such final, non-appealable
adjudication, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Indemnified Party.

10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, except for resolution of Adjustment Statements
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, obligations of Purchaser under  _Section_
__ _ 6.6_, claims based upon fraud in the making of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III, Article IV and Article V and claims
against the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with the procedures
and subject to the limitations set forth therein, each of the Parties agrees
that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified
Persons, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for
breach of Contract or warranty or tortious conduct) are the indemnification
and/or reimbursement obligations of the Parties set forth in this _Article X_.
The Purchaser Indemnified Persons expressly waive any and all rights and
remedies against the Seller Parties or the Paragon Companies under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C. §9601 et seq. as amended, and other Environmental Laws in connection
with any Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the ownership or operation of the
business of the Paragon Companies. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
10.7_ shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action under _Sections
8.2_ or __ _ 11.4_ to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof.

10.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The Parties agree that any
adjustments under _Article II_ and any indemnification payments made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be treated for Income Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE XI.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

11.1 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended other than in an
instrument in writing signed by each of Purchaser and the Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Sections 11.8_ ,
_11.9_ , _11.13_ , _11.18_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ (and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of such
Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in
any manner that is adverse in any respect to the Debt Financing Source
Parties without the prior written consent of the Lead Arranger.

11.2 _Waiver_. Any Party, for itself but not any other Party, may agree
to an extension of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts required to be performed by another Party hereunder, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of another Party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with
any of such Partys agreements. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing (including this Agreement)
signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. No failure or delay by any
Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 



63 11.3 _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered

64 11.4 _Specific Performance_. Subject in all respects to  _Section_ __ _
11.9_ but not subject to any other provision of this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Purchaser and Seller
agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that one of the
Parties does not perform its obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breaches such provisions. It
is accordingly agreed that the Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without (i) the posting a bond, or
other security or undertaking, (ii) the necessity of showing actual damages
and (iii) the necessity of showing that monetary damages are an inadequate
remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Notwithstanding the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, in the
event of litigation among the Parties arising pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.4_, the non-prevailing party shall pay or reimburse the prevailing party
for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
incurred by the prevailing party.

 

11.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, subsections, paragraphs, Annexes or exhibits, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, Annex or
exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The Parties agree that
any drafts of this Agreement or any Transaction Document prior to the final
fully executed drafts hereof or thereof shall not be used for purposes of
interpreting any provision hereof or thereof, and each of the Parties agrees
that no party or any Affiliate thereof shall make any claim, assert any
defense or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the foregoing in
connection with any Proceeding among any of the foregoing. The words
"include," "includes" and "including," when used herein, shall be deemed in
each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "herein"
and similar references mean, except where a specific Article, Section,
subsection or paragraph reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement
rather than any specific Article, Section, subsection or paragraph. The table
of contents and the headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Where reference is made in this Agreement to any item being
in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Companys past practice or any
similar phrase, it shall mean in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
Companys past practice, provided that, to the extent that the Companys past
practice was not in accordance with GAAP, then it shall mean in accordance
with GAAP. The word covenant means any agreement or covenant other than a
representation or warranty. Purchaser shall have the right to rely on all
representations and warranties of the Company or any Seller Party herein, and
the Seller Parties shall have the right to rely on all representations and
warranties of Purchaser and Parent herein. Whenever this Agreement indicates
that the Seller Parties have "made available" or otherwise provided any
document or information to Purchaser, such statement is to be deemed to be a
statement that such document or information was (i) delivered to
Purchaser with acknowledged written receipt of such document or information
or (ii) made available (with separate written notice to Purchaser, as
applicable) for viewing online on the electronic data site maintained by
Intralinks at least twenty-four hours prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

11.6 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions 

 



65  contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any of the
Parties. Upon such determination that any term or provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to amend or otherwise modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
such that that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

11.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Transaction
Documents (including all annexes, exhibits and Company Disclosure Schedules)
and other documents and instruments delivered in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede all prior
representations, agreements, understandings and undertakings, whether written
or oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof (including the Confidentiality Agreement, which will be of
no further force and effect as of the Closing), and no Party is relying on
any other prior oral or written representations, agreements, understandings or
undertakings with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

11.8 _Assignment_ _; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be
deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a party
to this Agreement except as contemplated by _Sections 10.2_ and _11.14_ and
except that Covered Parties shall expressly be beneficiaries of and entitled
to enforce _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ and except that the Debt Financing Source
Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Sections 11.1_ ,
_11.9_ , _11.13_ , _11.18_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, each of such
Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Source
Parties and the Debt Financing Source Parties shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections. No assignment of this Agreement
or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by the Seller, the
Company or Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or
otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void; provided,
however that, after the Closing, (i) Purchaser may assign all of its rights
to payment under this Agreement to any Affiliate, but no such assignment shall
relieve Purchaser of any liability or obligation hereunder and (ii) the Seller
may assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
a liquidating trust or similar entity in connection with the liquidation of
the Seller. No assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the
Parties of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

11.9 _No Recourse or Personal Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims
or causes of action for breach of this Agreement may only be made against the
Persons that are expressly identified as Parties and no other Person shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of
this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith. In addition, the Seller shall not have any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source Parties in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Seller shall not seek to recover any money damages
(including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, or damages on
account of a willful and material breach) from any Debt Financing Source
Party. 

11.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part
of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other (or further) exercise
thereof or of any other right.

 



66 11.11 _General Release_.

 

(a) Effective upon Closing, the Seller does hereby release and forever
discharge the Paragon Companies and their officers, directors, managers,
employees, successors and assigns, in their respective capacities as such
(collectively, the " _Released Parties_ "), of and from any and all
Proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, demands, suits, covenants,
agreements, representations, obligations, costs, liabilities, expenses, losses
and debts of any nature whatsoever, both at Law and in equity, relating to any
matter, Claim or right, whether presently known or unknown, which Seller
has, ever had or may have against such Released Parties, in each case arising
from or relating to any facts or events occurring at or prior to the Closing,
other than those obligations of the Purchaser arising under or contemplated by
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or under any other
Transaction Document.

(b) Seller shall not, and no one on its behalf shall, assert or file any
claim, complaint, charge, suit or action against any Released Party arising
out of any matter released pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_. In the
event that any claim, complaint, charge, suit or action is asserted or filed
against a Released Party in breach hereof, such Released Party shall be
entitled to recover its costs, fees or expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs at trial and on appeal, incurred in defending against such
action, from the Seller.

(c) The Seller acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts different
from, or in addition to, those which they now believe to be true with respect
to any and all of the claims released in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and no
such additional fact shall affect the validity or enforceability of the
releases contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11._

(d) Seller acknowledges that it is fully informed and aware of its right
to receive independent legal advice regarding the advisability of the releases
contemplated hereby and have received such independent legal advice as they
deem necessary with regard to the advisability thereof. The Seller
further acknowledges that it has made an investigation of the facts
pertaining to the releases contemplated hereby as it has deemed necessary,
and, further, acknowledges that it has not relied upon any statement or
representation of others.

 

11.12 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided herein, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
(including any brokerage commissions or any finders or investment bankers
fees and including attorneys and accountants fees) incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated hereby and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except as otherwise provided by this Agreement.

11.13 _Governing Law_ _; Venue_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of Delaware without
regard to any conflicts of law principles that would require the application
of any other Law. Each Party agrees to personal jurisdiction in any action
brought in any Court, Federal or State, within the State of Delaware having
subject matter jurisdiction over the matters arising under this Agreement. Any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
only be instituted in the State of Delaware. Each Party waives any objection
which it may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of such action
or proceeding and irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
such Court in any such suit, action or Proceeding. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Parties hereby (i) submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and any appellate court therefrom) for the purpose of any
action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Debt Financing
brought by any Party against the Financing Source Parties; provided, that if
federal jurisdiction is not available, each of the Parties hereby submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction that is
located in the County, City and State of New York (and any appellate court
therefrom), and (ii)

 



67  irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action is improper or that this
Agreement or the transactions may not be enforced in or by the above-
named courts.

11.14 _Retention of Advisors_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under
or in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Seller and
its owners shall have the right, at their election, to retain Paul Hastings
LLP to represent them in such matter, even if such representation shall be
adverse to Purchaser and/or the Paragon Companies. Purchaser and the Paragon
Companies, for themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns, hereby irrevocably consent to any such representation in any such
matter. Purchaser and the Paragon Companies, for themselves and for their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any
actual or potential conflict arising from any such representation in the event
of: (1) any adversity between the interests of the Seller and its owners
on the one hand and Purchaser and the Paragon Companies on the other hand, in
any such matter; and (2) any communication between Paul Hastings LLC and any
Paragon Company, its Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or
any other information known to such counsel, by reason of such counsels
representation of any of the Paragon Companies prior to Closing.

 

11.15 _Protected Communication_. The parties to this Agreement agree that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further action (a)
all right, title and interest of any Paragon Company in and to all Protected
Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in the Seller
and its successors in interest, and (b) any and all protections from
disclosure, including, but not limited to, attorney client privileges and work
product protections, associated with or arising from any Protected
Communications that would have been exercisable by any Paragon Company shall
thereupon be vested exclusively in the Seller and its successors in interest
and shall be exercised or waived solely as directed by the Seller or its
successors in interest. None of the Paragon Companies, Purchaser or any Person
acting on any of their behalf shall, without the prior written consent of the
Seller or its successors in interest, assert or waive or attempt to assert or
waive any such protection against disclosure, including, but not limited to,
the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, or discover,
obtain, use or disclose or attempt to discover, obtain, use or disclose any
Protected Communications in any manner, including in connection with any
dispute or legal proceeding relating to or in connection with this Agreement,
the events and negotiations leading to this Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated herein, provided, however, the foregoing shall
neither prohibit Purchaser from seeking proper discovery of such
documents nor the Seller from asserting that such documents are not
discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney client privileges and work
product protections have attached thereto. The Seller and its successors in
interest shall have the right at any time prior to or following the Closing
to remove, erase, delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal with any Protected
Communications in whatever way they desire, and the Companies and Purchaser
shall provide full access to all Protected Communications in their possession
or within their direct or indirect control and shall provide reasonable
assistance at the expense of the Person requesting such assistance in order to
give full force and effect to the rights of the Seller and its successors
in interest hereunder.

11.16 _No Waiver of Privilege, Protection from Disclosure or Use_. The
Parties understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including the
foregoing provisions regarding the assertions of protection from disclosure
and use, privilege and conflicts of interest, shall be deemed to be a waiver
of any applicable attorney-client privilege or other protection from
disclosure or use. Each of the parties understands and agrees that it has
undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of Protected
Communications. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Parties understand and
agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
could result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may be
confidential, eligible to be subject to a claim of privilege, or
otherwise protected

 



68  from disclosure. The parties further understand and agree that any
disclosure of information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of
privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute a
waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or
protection from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with respect to
information involving or concerning the same subject matter as the
disclosed information. The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to
return any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing party
promptly upon becoming aware of its existence. The parties further agree that
promptly after the return of any inadvertently disclosed information, the
party returning such information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries,
descriptions and/or notes of such inadvertently disclosed information,
including electronic versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents
or communications that contain such copies, summaries, descriptions or notes.

 

11.17 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule is hereby
incorporated by reference into the sections in which they are directly
referenced. The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for
disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedule does not and shall not be deemed
to create or imply a standard of materiality hereunder. The Company
Disclosure Schedule is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company except to the
extent expressly provided in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand
in any way the scope or effect of any of such representations or warranties.
Certain information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule is included
solely for information purposes and may not be required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement. The inclusion of an item in any Company
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to
be disclosed in connection with the representations or warranties of the
Company nor shall such information constitute an admission by any Party, as
applicable, that such item constitutes an item, event, circumstance or
occurrence that is material to the Paragon Companies or constitutes a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Any fact or item that is disclosed in any
Company Disclosure Schedule in a way as to make its relevance or applicability
to information called for by any other Schedule reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other
Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference
thereto. Disclosure of any allegations with respect to any alleged breach,
violation or default under any contractual or other obligation, or any law,
is not an admission that such breach, violation or default has occurred.
Headings and subheadings have been inserted on any Company Disclosure Schedule
for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered a part of or
affect the construction or interpretation of such Company Disclosure Schedule.
Where the terms of a Contract or other item have been summarized or described
in the Company Disclosure Schedule, such summary or description does not
purport to be a complete statement of the material terms of such contract or
other item, and, all such summaries and descriptions are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the contract or item being summarized and/or
described. The information provided in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
being provided solely for the purpose of making disclosures to Purchaser under
this Agreement. In disclosing this information, the Seller Parties do not
waive, and expressly reserve any rights under, any attorney-client privilege
associated with such information or any protection afforded by the work-
product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed
therein.

 

11.18 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARY HEREOF HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO
ANY ACTION RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER, OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
DEBT FINANCING, EACH PARTY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY,
INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING
SOURCE PARTY.

 



69 11.19 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in
one or more counterparts (including by facsimile transmission or electronic
transmission in portable document format (.pdf)), which when taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

11.20 _Parent Guaranty_. In consideration of the covenants, agreements and
undertakings of the Seller contained in this Agreement, Parent hereby agrees
to take all action necessary to cause Purchaser to perform all of its
agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Parent
unconditionally guarantees to the Seller, and its permitted successors and
assigns, the full, prompt and complete payment and performance by Purchaser of
all of the covenants, conditions, agreements and obligations of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Purchaser under this
Agreement. This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of
collectability. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, all notice of
default by the Purchaser, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any
right to require any proceeding first against Purchaser, protest, Parent
hereby consents to any extension that may be given by the Seller to the
Purchaser of time of payment or performance, or otherwise in connection with
the performance of its obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.20_.
The obligations of Parent to guarantee Purchasers obligations pursuant to
this Section __ _ 11.20_ shall be construed as a continuing absolute and
unconditional obligation of Parent to guarantee the payment and performance of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

11.21 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
