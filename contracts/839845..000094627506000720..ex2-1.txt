ARTICLE II  THE MERGER   2.1 The Merger. This Agreement provides for the
merger of FMS with and into Merger Corp., whereby the stock of FMS and Merger

of the date and time specified in Articles of Merger filed with the OTS and
the date and time specified in the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the
New Jersey Office of the Secretary of State pursuant to the N.J.S.A. The date
and time on which the Merger shall become effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time."   2.2 Effect of the Merger.   (a) The
Corporate Merger. FMS shall merge with and into Merger Corp. with Merger
Corp. as the surviving entity (the "Corporate Merger"). Merger Corp. and FMS
shall enter into the Corporate Merger Agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit A attached hereto. Immediately thereafter, Merger Corp. shall merge
with and into Bancorp with Bancorp as the surviving entity in accordance with
the Mid-Tier Merger Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached
hereto.   (b) FMB shall merge with and into BMSB with BMSB as the
surviving institution (the "Bank Merger"). The Bank Merger shall be effected
pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C
attached hereto. As a result of the Bank Merger, the existence of FMB shall
cease and BMSB shall be the surviving association and continue to existence
as a savings bank under the laws of Pennsylvania.   (c) Charter and Bylaws
of Bancorp. The Charter of Bancorp as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Charter of Bancorp immediately after the   
11   Effective Time. The Bylaws of Bancorp as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of Bancorp immediately after the
Effective Time.   (d) Directors and Officers of Bancorp. As of the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Bancorp shall be the directors
and officers of Bancorp serving immediately prior the Effective Time, plus
the current members of FMS\'s Board appointed to Bancorp\'s Board pursuant to
Section 3.16.   2.3 Conversion of Shares Upon Merger. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Bancorp, FMS or
holders of FMS Common Stock, the following shall occur:   (a) FMS Common
Stock. Subject to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.6(c), each share of FMS Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as defined and
pursuant to Section 2.5.   (b) FMS Common Stock Held by FMS. All shares of
FMS Common Stock (other than shares of FMS Common Stock held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties) that
are (i) owned by FMS as treasury stock, or (ii) owned directly or indirectly
by FMS or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, shall be cancelled and no
Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefore.   2.4 FMS Stock Options. Upon the satisfaction of all conditions
set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each holder of an option that is outstanding under the FMS
Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not the
option is then exercisable, shall receive from FMS in cancellation of such
option (such cancellation to be reflected in a written agreement) a cash
payment in an amount determined by multiplying the number of shares of FMS
Common Stock subject to option by such holder by an amount equal to the
difference between the Cash Consideration and the per share exercise price of
such option, net of any cash which must be withheld under federal and state
income tax requirements. Immediately thereafter, FMS shall cancel each such
option.   2.5 Merger Consideration.   (a) Subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.5, each share of FMS Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.3(b)) shall be converted at the election of the holder
thereof, subject to and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into:   (i) the right to receive in cash from Bancorp, without
interest, an amount equal to $28.00 (the "Cash Consideration");   13   
(ii) the right to receive from Bancorp that number of shares of Bancorp
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the
"Stock Consideration"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to 2.80; or  
(iii) the right to receive a combination of the foregoing in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Agreement.   "Merger Consideration" means
the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration or any combination
thereof.   (b) Maximum Conversion Numbers. Subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 2.5(c): (i) the total number of shares of FMS Common Stock to
be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration for such
shares (including any such shares subject to the cash portion of a Mixed
Election (as defined below)), shall be 42.5% of the number of shares of FMS
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.3(b)) (the "Cash Conversion
Number"); (ii) the total number of shares of FMS Common Stock to be converted
into the right to receive Stock Consideration for such shares (including any
such shares subject to the stock portion of a Mixed Election) shall be 57.5%
of the number of shares of FMS Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.3(b)) (the "Stock Conversion Number"); and (iii) the maximum number of
shares of Bancorp Common Stock which may be issued as Stock Consideration
will be equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Stock Conversion Number
and the maximum amount of cash which will be paid as Cash Consideration will
be equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by Cash Conversion Number.  
(c) Adjustments.   (i) Adjustments To the Cash Conversion Number and the
Stock Conversion Number Dependent Upon Minority Offering Appraisal. The
Cash Conversion Number and Stock Conversion Number will be adjusted to ensure
the OTS\' requirement that the percentage of Stock Consideration issued to
FMS Shareholders as Merger Consideration is less than 50% of the amount of
stock issued by Bancorp publicly in the Minority Stock Offering is satisfied.
In addition, to the extent necessary to maintain the aggregate pro forma
tangible book value of the shares of Bancorp Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger at not less than $65.609 million: (A) the Cash Conversion Number will
decrease to no lower than 35% of the number of shares of FMS Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.3(b)); and (B) the Stock Conversion Number
will increase to no greater than 65% of the number of shares of FMS Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares
to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.3(b)). For purposes of this provision,
pro forma tangible book value per share shall be as disclosed in the final
appraisal as approved by the OTS in connection with the Minority Stock
Offering.   (ii) Adjustment for Dilution and Other Matters. If, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, each of the outstanding
shares of FMS Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or into a different class by reason of   14   any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of FMS Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this agreement prior to such event.   (d) Election
Procedures.   (i) All elections contemplated by Section 2.5(a) shall be made
on a form designed for that purpose prepared by FMS and reasonably acceptable
to Bancorp (an "Election Form"). Holders of record of shares of FMS Common
stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative
capacities ("Representatives") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided
that such Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all
the shares of FMS Common Stock held by each such Representative for a
particular beneficial owner.   (ii) The Election Form shall be mailed on
the same date as the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to all
holders of record of shares of FMS Common Stock as of the record date of the
FMS Meeting. Thereafter FMS and Bancorp shall each use its reasonable and
diligent efforts to mail the Election Form to all persons who become record
holders of shares of FMS Common Stock during the period between the record
date for the Stockholders\' Meeting and 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the day
five (5) business days prior to the date of the FMS Meeting. In order to be
effective, an Election Form must be received by the Exchange Agent (as
defined below), on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day
prior to the FMS Meeting (the "Election Deadline"). An election shall have
been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more
certificates theretofore representing FMS Common Stock ("Certificate(s)") (or
customary affidavits and, if required by Bancorp pursuant to Section
2.6(a), indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing
all shares of FMS Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with
duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement and the Election Form, the Exchange Agent
shall have reasonable discretion to determine wither any election has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election
Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. All elections will be revocable unit
the Election Deadline and thereafter shall be irrevocable.   (iii) Each
Election Form shall entitle the holder of shares of FMS Common Stock (or the
beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of such
holder\'s shares (a "Cash Election"); (i i) elect to receive the Stock
Consideration for all of such holder\'s shares (a "Stock Election"),
(iii) elect to receive the Cash Consideration with respect to some of such
holder\'s shares and the Stock Consideration with respect to such holder\'s
remaining shares (a "Mixed Election"), or (iv) make no election or indicate
that such holder has no preference as to the receipt of the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration (a "Non-Election"). Shares of FMS
Common Stock as to which a valid Cash Election has been made (including
pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as "Cash Election
Shares." The aggregate number of shares of FMS Common Stock as to which a
valid Cash Election is made is referred to herein as the "Cash Election
Number." Shares of FMS Common Stock as to which a valid Stock Election has
been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as
"Stock Election Shares." The aggregate number of shares of    14   FMS
Common Stock as to which a valid Stock Election is made is referred to herein
as the "Stock Election Number." Shares of FMS Common Stock as to which a Non-
Election is deemed in effect are referred to as "Non-Election Shares."
All shares of FMS Common Stock of a holder whose properly completed Election
Form is not received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
shall be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. If the Exchange Agent shall have
determined that any purported election was not properly made, such purported
election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the shares of FMS
Common Stock subject to such purported election shall for purposes hereof be
deemed to be Non-Election Shares.   (e) Proration Procedures. As soon as
practicable after the Election Deadline, Bancorp shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the allocation among holders of FMS Common Stock of rights to
receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:  
(i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number,
then:   (A) all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares  shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and   (B) each
holder of Stock Election Shares shall have the  right to receive:   (1) the
number of shares of FMS Common Stock equal to  the product obtained by
multiplying (a) the number of Stock Election  Shares held by such holder by
(b) the Exchange Ratio by (c) a fraction  (rounded to four decimal places)
the numerator of which is the Stock  Conversion Number (as adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.5(c)) and the  denominator of which is the Stock Election Number
(the "Stock  Proration Factor"), and   (2) cash in an amount equal to the
product obtained by  multiplying (a) the number of Stock Election shares held
by such  holder by (b) the Cash Consideration by (c) one minus the Stock 
Proration Factor.   Except as provided herein and except as may be required
by Section  2.5(c)(ii), no other change shall be made with respect to the
number of  shares of Bancorp Common Stock that may be received in respect to
shares of  FMS Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made.   
(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) (the amount by which the Stock
Conversion   15   Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred
to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-
Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:   (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the  number
of Non-Election Shares, then   (1) all Cash Election Shares shall be
converted into  the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and   (2) each
holder of Non-Election Shares shall have the  right to receive (a) the number
of shares of Bancorp Common Stock  equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of  Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
the Exchange Ratio by  (z) a fraction (rounded to four decimal places) the
numerator of which  is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is
the total  number of Non-Election Shares (the "Non-Election Proration
Factor")  and (b) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying  (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
the  Cash Consideration by (z) one minus the Non-Election Proration Factor; 
or   (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of  Non-Election
Shares, then:   (1) all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the 
right to receive the Stock Consideration; and   (2) each holder of Cash
Election Shares shall have the  right to receive (a) the number of shares of
Bancorp Common Stock  equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Cash  Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Exchange Ratio
by (z) a  fraction (rounded to four decimal places) the numerator of which
is  the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of  Non-
Election Shares and the denominator of which is the Cash Election  Number
(the "Cash Proration Factor") and (b) cash in an amount equal  to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election  Shares held by such
holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by (z) one  minus the Cash Proration
Factor.   2.6 Exchange of FMS Common Stock.   (a) Surrender of
Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event
later than five (5) business days following the Effective Time a firm
selected by Bancorp and reasonably acceptable to FMS (the "Exchange Agent"),
pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Bancorp and FMS consistent
with the terms hereof, shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
who did not previously submit a properly completed Election Form together
with duly executed transmittal materials prior to the Election Deadline:  
16    (i) a form letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or a lost certificate
affidavit and bond in a form reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent) to
the Exchange Agent; and   (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (in
the form or forms determined in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.5). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent)
or a lost certificate affidavit and bond in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Exchange Agent), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therfor, (i) a certificate evidencing the whole number of shares of Bancorp
Common Stock into which the shares of FMS Common Stock theretofore
represented by the Certificate so surrendered, shall have been converted
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.5, if any, plus (ii) a check for the
aggregate amount of cash, without interest, which such holder would be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.5, if any, including any cash
amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.6(c). Certificates so surrendered shall be cancelled. Bancorp shall direct
the Exchange Agent to make such deliveries within five (5) business days of
the receipt of all required documentation. If any Bancorp Common Stock to be
exchanged for shares of FMS Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it
shall be a condition to the exchange that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that all
signatures shall be guaranteed by a member firm of any national securities
exchange in the United States or the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., or by a commercial bank or trust company or other financial
institution acceptable to Bancorp having an office in the United States, and
that the person requesting the payment shall either (a) pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
(b) establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have
been paid or are not payable. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of FMS of any shares of FMS
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and any such
shares of FMS Common Stock presented to the Exchange Agent shall be cancelled
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto as
provided in Section 2.5 above.   (b) Failure to Exchange FMS Common Stock.
No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Bancorp Common Stock payable to the holders of record thereof
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to Bancorp Common Stock represented thereby and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any holder until
the holder of record shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect,
if any, of applicable law, after the subsequent surrender and exchange of a
Certificate the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore
became payable with respect to the Bancorp Common Stock represented by such
Certificate. All dividends or other distributions declared on or after the
Effective Time with respect to the Bancorp Common Stock and payable to the
holders of record thereof on or after the Effective Time which are payable to
the holder of a Certificate not theretofore surrendered and exchanged for
Bancorp   17   Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall be paid
or delivered by Bancorp to the Exchange Agent, in trust, for the benefit of
such holders. All such dividends and distributions held by the Exchange Agent
for payment or delivery to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates
unclaimed at the end of one (1) year from the Effective Time shall be repaid
or redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Bancorp after which time any holder
of Certificates who has not theretofore surrendered such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, subject to applicable law, shall look only to Bancorp for
payment or delivery of such dividends or distributions, as the case may be.
Any shares of Bancorp Common Stock or other consideration delivered or made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) and not
exchanged for Certificates within one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be returned by the Exchange Agent to Bancorp which shall thereafter act as
exchange agent subject to the rights of holders of unsurrendered Certificates
hereunder.   (c) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Bancorp Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender or exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of
Bancorp shall relate to any fractional shares, and such fractional shares
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or assert any rights of
a stockholder of Bancorp. In lieu of any fractional share of Bancorp Common
Stock, Bancorp shall cause to be paid to each holder of shares of FMS Common
Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
Bancorp Common Stock an amount of cash, rounded to the nearest cent (without
interest), equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Cash
Consideration.   (d) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable
to a former holder of FMS Common Stock for any consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable escheat or abandoned property
laws.   (e) Exchange Fund. On the date the Effective Time occurs,
Bancorp shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holders of FMS Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, an aggregate amount of cash, sufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5 of this
Agreement (plus an additional amount of cash sufficient to cover amounts
payable in lieu of any fractional shares of FMS Common Stock ("Election
Fund")).   (f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Bancorp. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Bancorp. In
the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully
satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, then Bancorp shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in
an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such payment obligations.   2.7 Tax-Free Reorganization. The
parties intend that this Agreement be a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the Merger be a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code to the extent that shares of
FMS Common Stock are exchanged for shares of Bancorp Common Stock as
described in this Agreement. No   18   party shall voluntarily take or
cause to be taken any action which would disqualify the Merger as a tax-free
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.   2.8 Reserved.   2.9
Minority Stock Offering.   In connection with the Merger and subject to the
requirements of Section 6.3 of this Agreement, Bancorp will take all steps
necessary to conduct an offering of shares of Bancorp Common Stock in
accordance with the applicable regulations of the OTS ("Minority Stock
Offering"). Such shares shall be offered for sale at a price of $10.00 per
share. Following the Minority Stock Offering and the Merger, no more than 49%
of the outstanding shares of Bancorp Common Stock shall be owned by parties
other than Beneficial MHC.   Following the Minority Stock Offering and the
Merger, Beneficial MHC will own at least 51% of Bancorp Common Stock issued
and outstanding, and the Bancorp Common Stock issued in the Minority Stock
Offering to parties other than Beneficial MHC and in the Merger to the former
FMS Shareholders shall constitute up to 49% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Bancorp Common Stock.   The amount of Bancorp Common Stock to be
offered to parties other than Beneficial MHC will be determined so that the
total of Bancorp Common Stock issued to parties other than Beneficial MHC in
the Minority Stock Offering, plus shares of Bancorp Common Stock issued to
FMS Shareholders in the Merger as well as shares reserved for options or the
other future compensation programs for directors and employees of Bancorp and
its Subsidiaries, would constitute less than 50% of the total Bancorp Common
Stock issued and outstanding, and the balance would be owned by Beneficial
MHC.   2.10 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Bancorp may specify (subject to FMS\'s approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld) that any of its or Beneficial
MHC\'s direct or indirect subsidiaries, and FMS and any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries shall enter into transactions other than those
described in this Article II, in order to effect the purposes of this
Agreement, and Bancorp and FMS shall take all action necessary and
appropriate to effect, or cause to be affected, such transactions; provided,
however, that (i) other than a change in structure required by a regulatory
agency having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, no such specification shall materially and adversely affect
the timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein; or
(ii) no such specifications shall materially and adversely affect the tax
treatment or economic benefits of the Merger to the holders of FMS Common
Stock or to Beneficial MHC, its members or Subsidiaries.   ARTICLE III 
OTHER AGREEMENTS   3.1 Confidentiality; Access. The Confidentiality
Agreement previously entered into between Bancorp and FMS shall remain in
full force and effect. Upon reasonable notice, each    19   party shall
afford to the other\'s officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel and
other representatives access, during normal business hours, to all of its and
its Subsidiaries\' properties, books, contracts, commitments and records;
provided that FMS shall have the right to redact any information from such
materials which relates to assessments, analyses or discussions of a possible
Acquisition engaged in by it prior to the date of this Agreement, or which,
relates to matters or issues concerning its evaluation of the Merger or its
obligations under this Agreement, or that would impair its Board
of Directors\' ability to discharge its fiduciary duties.   3.2 Disclosure

Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
documents so described, true copies of which heretofore have been delivered

including appropriate authorizations from the OTS and the FDIC, except where
a failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
power,   26   authority and FMS Approvals would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FMS, and neither FMS nor any
FMS Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the
revocation or modification of any FMS Approvals.   (b) Each of FMS and FMB
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to conduct business,
and is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties it owns, leases or operates or the
nature of the activities it conducts make such qualification or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified and licensed and
in good standing that would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on FMS.   (c) A true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of FMS (the "FMS Subsidiaries"), together with (i) FMS\'s direct
or indirect percentage ownership of each FMS Subsidiary; (ii) the
jurisdiction in which the FMS Subsidiaries are incorporated; and (iii) a

outstanding shares of capital stock of FMB is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and such shares owned by FMS are owned

benefits solely as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
or as a result of a "change in control," within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code. Except as indicated on the FMS

insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
FMS or FMB.   (c) To the Knowledge of FMS, each FMS Existing Plan has always
been operated in material compliance with the requirements of all applicable

representative retained by FMS or any of the FMS Subsidiaries to take any
such action, and FMS shall promptly notify Bancorp orally, and confirm in
writing, subject to disclosure being consistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of FMS, all of the relevant details relating to all

Section 6.14 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of FMS from: (A) complying
with its disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B) providing
information in response to a request therefore by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the FMS Board of
Directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement substantially similar to that entered into with
Bancorp; (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal or
(D) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of FMS, if
and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C)
or (D) above, (i) the FMS Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action would be
required in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary
duties under applicable law, and (ii) the FMS Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is at least as reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and, if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the FMS shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger. An Acquisition Proposal which is
received and considered by FMS in compliance with this section 6.14 and which
meets the requirements set forth in clause (D) of the preceding sentence is
herein referred to as a "Superior Proposal." FMS agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. FMS agrees that it will notify Bancorp
immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any
such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued with FMS or any of
its representatives after the date hereof, and the identity of the  
51   person making such inquiry, proposal or offer and the substance
thereof and will keep Bancorp informed of any material developments with
respect thereto immediately upon the occurrence thereof.   (b) In the event
that the Board of Directors of FMS determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and upon advice from outside counsel,
that it desires to accept a Superior Proposal, it shall notify Bancorp in
writing of its intent to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into an
acquisition agreement with respect to, or recommend acceptance of,
the Superior Proposal. Such notice shall specify all of the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identify the Person making
such Superior Proposal. Bancorp shall have three calendar days to evaluate
and respond to FMS\' notice. If Bancorp notifies FMS in writing prior to
the expiration of the three calendar day period provided above that it
shall increase the Merger Consideration to an amount at least equal to that
of such Superior Proposal (the "Bancorp Proposal"), then FMS shall not be
permitted to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to, or permit
its Board to recommend acceptance to its shareholders of, such Superior
Proposal. Such notice by Bancorp shall specify the new Merger Consideration.
FMS shall have three calendar days to evaluate the Bancorp Proposal.   (c)
In the event that the Board of Directors FMS determines in good faith, upon
the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel, that the Bancorp
Proposal is not at least equal to the Superior Proposal, FMS can terminate
this Agreement in order to execute an acquisition agreement with respect to,
or to allow its Board to adopt a resolution recommending acceptance to FMS\'
shareholders of, the Superior Proposal as provided in Section 8.1(k).   6.3
Minority Stock Offering. Within 60 days of the date hereof, Bancorp shall
adopt a Plan of Minority Stock Issuance in connection with the Minority Stock
Offering. Such Plan shall conform in all respects with HOLA and
the requirements and regulations of the OTS. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.5(b),

so as to permit the maximum number of shares of Bancorp Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to FMS Shareholders. Bancorp shall promptly prepare and
file with the OTS a Form MHC-2 and shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-1 (the "S-1") in connection with the
Minority Stock Offering. The initial filings of the MHC-2 and the S-1 shall
contain financial information for both Bancorp and FMS at and for the year
ended December 31, 2006. Bancorp shall promptly respond to any and all
comments it receives on such filings from the respective staffs of the OTS
and SEC and shall use its best efforts to obtain approval of the MHC-2 and
have the S-1 declared effective. Bancorp will commence the Minority Stock
Offering promptly after receipt of all requisite regulatory clearances and
approvals.   6.4 Formation of Merger Corp. Bancorp shall take all actions
necessary to incorporate and organize Merger Corp.   6.5 Change in Bank
Control Act Filings. In the event that an FMS shareholder who is requested to
execute a Voting Agreement is required to or may elect to make any filings
pursuant   52   to 12 C.F.R. Part 574, Bancorp shall cooperate with any

Bancorp Termination Payment.   (a) Bancorp Special Payment. As a condition
of FMS\' willingness to, and in order to induce FMS to, enter into this
Agreement, and to reimburse FMS for incurring the damages, costs and expenses
related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Bancorp hereby agrees to pay to FMS, as
liquidated damages and in lieu of any other rights or remedies under this
Agreement, a cash payment (the "Special Payment") only if (i) the Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or Section 8.1(g), or (ii) Bancorp
does not consummate the Minority Offering and is otherwise unable to
consummate the Merger by December 31, 2007 or such later date agreed to as
contemplated in Section 8.1(d) other than as a result of the failure to
obtain any requisite approval or non-objection of the OTS contemplated in
Section 6.5; provided, however, that Bancorp shall not have breached its
obligation set forth in Section 6.5, or (iii) FMS has terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) because Bancorp
has intentionally and willfully breached any of its representations or
warranties herein or intentionally and willfully failed to perform or comply
with any of its covenants or agreements herein, to such extent as to permit
such termination (each of such reasons for termination being hereinafter
referred to as the "Special Payment Event"). If the Special Payment Event is
pursuant to subsection (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.3(a), then the Special
Payment shall amount to five million five hundred thousand dollars
($5,500,000). If the Special Payment Event is pursuant to subsection (iii) of
this Section 8.3(a), then the Special Payment shall amount to three million
seven hundred thousand dollars ($3,700,000). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Bancorp shall have no obligation to make the Special Payment to FMS if the
Special Payment Event is primarily due to a breach of a representation or
warranty of FMS (subject to the standard set forth in Section 7.2(c) of this
Agreement) or a breach by FMS of one or more covenants in this Agreement,
which breach of representation, warranty or covenant is the principal cause
of the occurrence of the Special Payment Event.   (b) Payment Required. Any
payment required to be made under this Section 8.3 shall be paid by Bancorp
to FMS by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by FMS within three (3) Business Days after demand by FMS.  
60    (c) Exclusivity of Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, if Bancorp pays or causes to be paid to
FMS the Special Payment, Bancorp will not have any further obligations or
liabilities to FMS with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE IX  MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 Entire
