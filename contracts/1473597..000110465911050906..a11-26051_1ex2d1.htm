 **ARTICLE II 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Equity Interests_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall
sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver the Equity Interests to the Buyer
(or its designee) and the Buyer (or its designee) shall purchase and acquire
the Equity Interests from the Seller, for an aggregate purchase price equal to
U.S.$275,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3 (the " _Purchase Price_
").

 



 

Section 2.2 _Closing_.

 



 

(a) The sale and purchase of the Equity Interests shall take place at a
closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of the Winston and Strawn
LLP, 35 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601, at 10:00 a.m., local time
on the second Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all conditions to the obligations of
the parties set forth in Article VII (other than such conditions as may, by
their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date), or at
such other place or at such other time or on such other date as the Seller and
the Buyer mutually may agree in writing. The day on which the Closing takes
place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." The effective time of the
Closing for tax, operational and all other matters will be deemed to be 11:59
p.m. (local time) on the Closing Date in each relevant jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, (i) the Buyer shall be entitled to designate one or more
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to purchase any of the Equity Interests
(each of the Buyer and any Person designated by the Buyer in accordance with
this clause, a member of the " _Buyer Group_ "); (ii) the Buyer (on behalf of
itself and/or on behalf of any designee of Buyer) shall deliver to the Seller,
by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by the Seller to the
Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to
the Estimated Purchase Price in immediately available funds in United States
dollars and (iii) the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
applicable member of the Buyer Group, the Equity Interests by delivery of
executed Assignment Agreements.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate of (i) the Closing Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with the Net Working
Capital Principles (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the
Excess Cash (the " _Estimated Excess Cash_ "). From the delivery of such
estimate until the Closing Date, the parties in good faith shall seek to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
estimate of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Excess Cash;
_provided_ that if the parties cannot reach agreement, the Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Excess Cash
shall prevail absent manifest error. The " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " shall
be an amount equal to the Purchase Price, _plus_ the amount by which the
Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Adjustment Amount, if any,
_minus_ the amount by which the Minimum Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital, if any, _plus_ the Estimated Excess Cash.

 



 

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Companies, dated as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with
the Net Working Capital Principles and (ii) a calculation of Excess Cash (the
" _Excess Cash Calculation_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Closing Net
Working Capital_ " shall mean the current assets of the Companies _minus_ the
current liabilities of the Companies, as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Closing Net Working Capital shall exclude (i)
any and all Cash; (ii) all deferred Tax liabilities and United States federal
and state Income Tax liabilities (other than state Income Tax liabilities in
respect of a stand alone state Return of any Company), (iii) all Tax assets,
such as deferred Tax assets or the right to use any Tax attributes or Tax
credits, or otherwise offset Tax payable in a Tax period after the Closing and
(iv) all dividends payable to the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) declared prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Excess Cash_ " shall mean an amount equal to (X) the sum of the Closing Cash
of each Company, _minus_ (Y) the Repatriation Deduction. The " _Repatriation
Deduction_ " shall mean (A) thirty percent (30%) of the first $3,000,000 of
the Aggregate Cash Overage, _plus_ (B) fifty percent (50%) of the amount by
which the Aggregate Cash Overage exceeds $3,000,000, if any. The " _Aggregate
Cash Overage_ " shall mean the sum of the Company Cash Overages. For each
non-U.S. Company, the " _Company Cash Overage_ " shall be the amount, if any,
by which the Closing Cash of such non-U.S. Company exceeds the Scheduled
Maximum Closing Cash for such non-U.S. Company. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Company Cash Overage shall be less than zero.

 



 

(c) During the 20 Business Day period following the Sellers receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Excess Cash Calculation, the Buyer shall
cooperate with the Seller and its Representatives to provide them with any
information used in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the Excess Cash
Calculation reasonably requested by the Seller and its Representatives
reasonably available to the Buyer. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Excess
Cash Calculation shall become final and binding on the 20th Business Day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the Seller
delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and amount of any disputed item. The
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Excess Cash Calculation not specifically
referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not
be subject to review in accordance with Section 2.3(d).

 



 

(d) During the 10 Business Day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Seller to the Buyer, the parties in good faith shall seek
to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified therein. During such 10 Business Day period, the Seller
shall cooperate with the Buyer and its Representatives to provide them with
any information used in preparing the Notice of Disagreement reasonably
requested by the Buyer or its Representatives reasonably available to the
Seller. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Buyer and the
Seller within such 10 Business Day period shall

 



      
 

 



 

be final and binding with respect to such items, and if the Seller and the
Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified by
the Seller in the Notice of Disagreement and the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital and the Excess Cash, the Closing Net Working Capital and
the Excess Cash so determined shall be final and binding on the parties for
all purposes hereunder. If the Seller and the Buyer have not resolved all such
differences by the end of such 10 Business Day period, the Seller and the
Buyer shall submit, in writing, to an independent public accounting firm (the
" _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), their briefs detailing their views as to
the nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital and the Excess Cash, and the Independent
Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each such disputed
item and the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital and the Excess
Cash, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be authorized to
resolve only those items remaining in dispute between the parties in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 2.3 within the range
of the difference between the Buyers position with respect thereto and the
Sellers position with respect thereto. The determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be based solely on the briefs submitted by the parties
and not on independent review, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of
the Independent Accounting Firm that it reached such determination in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall be KPMG, LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the
Seller and the Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within 20 Business Days
following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in any court referred to in
Section 10.11. The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this Section
2.3(d), including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm,
shall be borne by the parties in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The costs and expenses of any
enforcement of the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
borne by the party against whom the determination or obligation is being
enforced. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each party
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Closing Balance
Sheet and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable,
shall be borne by such party.

 



 

(e) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, in respect of
the Closing Net Working Capital and the Excess Cash as follows:

 



 

(i) if the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is more than $7,000,000 (the " _Maximum Adjustment Amount_ "), the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the difference
between the Closing Net Working Capital and the Maximum Adjustment Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.3 is less than $5,000,000 (the " _Minimum Adjustment Amount_ "), the
Purchase

 



      
 

 



 

Price shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the difference between
the Closing Net Working Capital and the Minimum Adjustment Amount;

 



 

(iii) if the Closing Net Working Capital is equal to or greater than
$5,000,000 and less than or equal to $7,000,000, the Purchase Price shall not
be adjusted with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital; and

 



 

(iv) if the Excess Cash is greater than zero, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted upwards (in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this
Section 2.3(e)) in an amount equal to the Excess Cash.

 



 

(f) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(e)
is:

 



 

(i) greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Buyer shall pay the
amount of such excess to the Seller;

 



 

(ii) less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Seller shall pay the
amount of such deficit to the Buyer; or

 



 

(iii) equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then no payment shall be made by
either party.

 



 

(g) Amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3(f) shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the prime lending
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the Closing Date,
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the number of days elapsed.
Payments in respect of Section 2.3(f) shall be made within three Business Days
of final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital and Excess Cash
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.3 by wire transfer of United
States dollars in immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
may be designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment at least
two Business Days prior to such payment date.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall be entitled

Companies all of their respective rights in any such Owned IP or (ii) are
obligated to assign to one of the Companies all of their respective rights in
any such Owned IP.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) None of the Owned IP is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, or
stipulation restricting the use thereof by the Business. To the Knowledge of
the Seller, the use of the Company IP by the Companies with respect to all

misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property rights of any Person or
give rise to a claim of unfair competition under any applicable law by any
Person.

 



 

(j) To the Knowledge of the Seller, none of the Seller or any of the Companies
has, in conducting the Business, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated, and the operation of the Business as currently conducted does not,
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property of any
third party. None of the Seller or any of the Companies has received any
notice of any claim or allegation (i) challenging the ownership, use, validity
or enforceability of any Owned IP or (ii) that any Persons Intellectual
Property rights are infringed by the Seller or any of the Companies ownership
or use of any Company IP (including without limitation offers to license).

the Seller or any of the Companies are party to any pending legal proceeding
that (i) alleges a claim of infringement, misappropriation, dilution or
violation of any Intellectual Property rights of any Person or (ii) challenges
the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Owned IP. To the
Knowledge of the Seller, there is no infringement, misappropriation or
violation by any Person of any of the Owned IP.

 



 

(k) The Seller and the Companies have taken all necessary actions to maintain
and protect all of the Registered IP and will continue to maintain all of the
Company IP prior to Closing so as not to adversely affect the validity or
enforceability thereof.

 



 

(l) No loss or expiration of any of the Owned IP, Licensed IP, Intellectual
Property provided pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement or the
Intellectual Property relating to services provided under the Transition
Services Agreement, is threatened, pending or reasonably foreseeable, except
for patents expiring at the end of their statutory terms (and not as a result
of any act or omission by the Seller or the Companies, including, without
limitation, a failure to pay any required maintenance fees).

 



 

(m) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
pursuant to any contract to which the Seller or any of the Companies is a
party, result in the loss or impairment of the Companies right to own or use
any Company IP, or of any right of any of the Companies to use or sublicense
any Company IP owned by others, to develop, market, distribute and sell the
products and services marketed, produced, distributed and sold by the Business
as of the Closing Date, or to conduct the Business as presently conducted.
Immediately subsequent to the Closing, the Company IP will be owned by or

relating to the Business as the Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access or furnishing of information shall be
conducted during normal business hours, under the supervision of the Sellers
personnel and in such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the
normal operations of the Business and the Seller and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Seller
or any of the Companies shall be required to disclose any information to the
Buyer or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the Sellers sole
reasonable judgment (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege, (ii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof or (iii) relate to any
consolidated, combined or unitary Return filed by the Seller or any Affiliate
thereof or any of their respective predecessor entities.

 



 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Seller (as it relates to the Business or any Company), or as

after the Closing or, if shorter, the applicable period specified in the
Buyers document retention policy, the Buyer shall (i) retain the books and

Section 5.3 _Update of Disclosure Schedules_. The Seller shall have the right
from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to any matter resulting from any action taken by the
Seller or any Company to which the Buyer expressly consented pursuant to
Section 5.1. Any supplemental or amended disclosure pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no supplemental
or amended disclosure other than one made pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 5.3 shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this Section 5.3, shall imply that the Seller is making any
representation or warranty as of any date other than the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any fact, change,

directly or indirectly, or through its present or future Affiliates, solicit
(other than a solicitation by general advertisement) any person who is an
employee of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, at the date hereof or at any
time hereafter that precedes the Closing or such termination, to terminate his
or her employment with the Seller or such Affiliate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Buyer shall not be prevented from employing any such Person who
contacts the Buyer solely on his or her own initiative or in response to
general advertisements in periodicals including newspapers and trade
publications. The Buyer agrees

 



      
 

 



 

that any remedy at law for any breach by the Buyer of this Section 5.6(a)
would be inadequate, and that the Seller would be entitled to injunctive
relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this restriction on the Buyer
is too onerous and is not necessary for the protection of the Seller, the
Buyer agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser
restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate
properly to protect the Seller.

 



 

(b) The Seller will not, for a period of two years following the Closing Date
(or, if this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, for a period of two
years following the date of such termination), without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, either alone or in conjunction with any other Person,
directly or indirectly, or through its present or future Affiliates, solicit
(other than a solicitation by general advertisement) any person who is an
employee of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, at the date hereof or at any
time hereafter that precedes the Closing or such termination, to terminate his
or her employment with the Buyer or such Affiliate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Seller shall not be prevented from employing any such Person who
contacts the Seller solely on his or her own initiative or in response to
general advertisements in periodicals including newspapers and trade
publications. The Seller agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by the
Seller of this Section 5.6(b) would be inadequate, and that the Buyer would be
entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held that this
restriction on the Seller is too onerous and is not necessary for the
protection of the Buyer, the Seller agrees that any court of competent
jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions which such court may consider
to be necessary or appropriate properly to protect the Buyer.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Resignations_. The Seller will deliver at the Closing the

dated March 18, 2011 between the Buyer and the Parent (the " _Confidentiality

any way in which otherwise facilities the establishment or operation of a
Competing Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, the Seller or
its Affiliates and Representatives may disclose such portion of the Business
Confidential Information or Transition Services Confidential Information as
the Seller or such Affiliate or Representative reasonably determines it is
required by applicable Law or a listing agreement with a securities exchange
to disclose if, to the extent permissible under applicable Law or such listing
agreement, it promptly notifies the Buyer of such disclosure requirement prior
to disclosure to enable the Buyer to seek an appropriate protective order or
waiver of compliance with such listing agreement. For purposes hereof, the

relates to the Business, the Contributed Assets and the Companies and the term
" _Transition Services Confidential Information_ " means all information that
relates to, or is provided by the Seller (whether prior to or following the

agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at
such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of

Section 5.1(t); (f) the Sellers allocable share of any Transfer Taxes, as
determined under Section 6.6; (g) any and all Excluded Taxes; (h) any and all
Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) resulting from the transactions effected by
the Contribution Agreement or the Foreign Contribution Agreement; and (i) any
income or capital gains Taxes imposed on any Company by tax authorities in
China (or any state or political subdivision therein) as a result of the
direct or indirect transfer of STR (Shanghai) Ltd., in each case without
duplication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers obligation in respect
of a breach of any representation pursuant to Section 6.1(d) shall not include
any Taxes arising in any period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date; _provided_ that this sentence shall not apply to breaches of
representations in Sections 3.17(g), (r) and (s). Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify a Person for a breach of a representation in Section 3.17(g) only if
Buyer provides notice of such breach on or before the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Closing Date. Seller shall be obligated to indemnify a Person for a
breach of a representation in Section 3.17(r) only if Buyer provides notice of
such breach on or

 



      
 

 



 

before the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date. Seller shall be
obligated to indemnify a Person for a breach of a representation in Section
3.17(s) only if Buyer provides notice of such breach on or before the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Returns and Tax Payments_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of (1) all
Returns of the each Company due (taking into account valid extensions) on or
before the Closing Date and (2) all Income Tax Returns of any Company for any
Pre-Closing Period (the " _Seller Prepared Returns_ ") and, in each case, the
payment of all Taxes payable with respect thereto. The Sellers shall, at their
sole cost and expense, prepare and timely file, or cause each Company to
prepare and timely file, all the Seller Prepared Returns. Other than U.S.
federal and state income tax Returns, all such Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures, practices, and accounting methods of each
Company (as applicable). Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of completed
drafts of such Returns other than U.S. federal and state Income Tax Returns at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including any
extension thereof), along with appropriate supporting information and
schedules, for Buyers review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and the Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due
date for filing. In the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the
due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section
6.2(f), which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all
Returns of the Companies other than the Seller Prepared Returns (the " _Buyer
Prepared Returns_ "). The Buyer shall cause each Company to prepare and timely
file all such Buyer Prepared Returns. To the extent that such Return relates
to a Pre-Closing Period, such Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice and conventions, unless such procedure, practice,
accounting method or other contemplated treatment does not have sufficient
legal support to avoid the imposition of Taxes in the form of penalties, in
which case, such Returns shall be prepared in accordance with any good faith
method determined by the Buyer that has sufficient support to avoid the
imposition of Taxes in the form of penalties. The Buyers good faith
determination shall take into account the Sellers indemnity obligations set
forth in Section 6.1 above. The Buyer shall deliver a draft of any Return
relating to a Pre-Closing Period to the Seller for its review and approval at
least thirty (30) days prior the due date (including any extension thereof),
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and Buyer
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such
Returns prior to the due date for filing (including any extension thereof). In
the event that Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect
to such Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing, such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 6.2(f), which resolution shall
be binding on the parties. The parties agree that the taxable years of the
Companies shall end as of the Closing Date for applicable Tax purposes except
where otherwise required by Law. Where applicable, the parties agree to file
elections to close the taxable year of any Company.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Seller is liable for the payment of Taxes pursuant
to Section 6.1 with respect to any Return relating to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period, the Seller shall pay the Taxes owed at least two (2) Business
Days before payment of such Taxes is

 



       
 

 



 

due to the relevant Governmental Authority by wire transfer of immediately
available fund to an account designed by the Buyer. No payment pursuant to
this Section 6.2(c) shall excuse the Seller from its indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 6.1 if the amount of Taxes as ultimately
determined (by audit or otherwise) relating to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period exceeds the amount of the Sellers payment under this Section
6.2(c).

 



 

(d) For purposes of preparing all Returns (and determining whether to make (or
not make) certain elections, decisions, or positions on certain Returns),
determining the Closing Net Working Capital and for purposes of determining
indemnification and payment obligations with respect to Taxes under Section
6.1, the parties agree to use the following conventions: (i) any property
taxes or other similar Taxes imposed on an annual basis shall be allocated
based on the ratio of the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes (including Income Taxes,
employment Taxes and sales and use Taxes) shall be determined based on an
actual "closing of the books" as if such tax period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which any Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time and all
dividends and distributions declared before the Closing Date shall be treated
as arising in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date). In the case of
clause (ii), exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions computed as
if the Closing Date was the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be
allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of the Straddle Period thereafter in proportion to the
number of days in each such portion. In addition, all Taxes in the form of
interest or penalties that relate to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) shall be treated as
occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued, assessed
or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Unless otherwise required under applicable Law, the parties agree to treat
all indemnification payments under this Agreement as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for all relevant Tax purposes.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the case of any dispute as to any matter covered by Section 6.2(a) or (b)
identified in such sections to be resolved in accordance with this Section
6.2(f) shall be resolved in accordance with Section 2.3(d) and this Section
6.2(f), and the fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne
equally by the Seller and the Buyer. If any dispute with respect to a Tax
Return (" _Disputed Return_ ") is not resolved prior to the due date of the
Disputed Return, (a) the Disputed Return shall be filed in the manner which
the party responsible for preparing Disputed Return deems correct; (b) the
dispute resolution process described in Section 2.3(d) shall continue, (c) the
parties shall take any steps necessary to prevent the lapsing of the statute
of limitations for filing an amended Tax Return with respect to the Disputed
Return while such dispute resolution process is continuing, and (d) at the
completion of the dispute resolution process, the parties shall, if necessary,
cause an amended Tax Return to be filed with respect to the Disputed Return
reflecting the position determined as a result of such dispute resolution
process.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 



 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer shall make (and, as necessary, cause any
Affiliate to make) elections pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with
respect to the domestic Subsidiaries, and shall cause similar elections to be
made where available for state Tax purposes, including, but not limited to,
participating in the timely filing of IRS Form 8023 and related or comparable
forms for state, local, or foreign law purposes (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election"_). The Buyer shall prepare any forms and authorizations
necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election (other than sections that
relate to information regarding the Sellers and parties in the Sellers
control), including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8023 and related or
comparable forms for state, local, or foreign law purposes, and the Buyer
shall provide them to the Sellers. The Seller shall (and, to the extent the
Seller is not treated as the owner of shares for income Tax purposes, the
Seller shall cause the party that is treated as the owner of the shares for
income Tax purposes to) execute and deliver to the Buyer, at the Closing, any
forms and authorizations necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election.
The Buyer shall file such forms with the applicable Taxing authorities. The
Seller (and, to the extent a Seller is not treated as the owner of the shares
for income Tax purposes, the Seller shall cause the party that is treated as
the owner of the shares for income Tax purposes) and the Buyer shall also
include such forms with their applicable Returns to the extent required by Law
to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Seller shall (and shall cause
its Affiliates to) take such other actions as may reasonably be requested by
the Buyer in order to facilitate the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election.

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the final determination of the Closing
Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.3, the Buyer shall provide the
Seller with its proposed allocation of the purchase price (the " _Allocation_
") among the Equity Interests and a further allocation among the assets of the
Companies, as determined for purposes of Section 338 of the Code. The Seller
shall have twenty (20) days to review and provide written comments on the
Allocation. If the Seller indicates its acceptance of the Allocation, or if
the Seller does not provide any written comments on the Allocation or does not
indicate in writing that the Allocation is unacceptable to the Seller within
such twenty (20)-day period, then the Allocation shall be deemed agreed to by
the parties. In such case, all Returns (including IRS Forms 8594 and 8883)
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with such Allocation. If the Seller
provides comments on the Allocation within such twenty (20)-day period, the
Buyer and the Seller shall attempt to negotiate an agreement with respect to
purchase price allocation. Any agreement with respect thereto shall be
reflected in writing and shall be treated as the agreed Allocation. In such
case, all Returns (including IRS Forms 8594 and 8883) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with such agreed Allocation. If the parties fail to arrive
at an agreed Allocation within six (6) months following the Closing, the
parties shall engage an independent account firm using the principles of
Section 2.3(d) to determine such Allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties agree that the Allocation to the foreign Subsidiaries (whether
agreed amongst the parties or as determined by such accounting firm) shall not
be less than $100 million.

 



 

(c) The Buyer covenants that with respect to each of DomesticCo and ForeignCo,
the Buyer shall cause all of the Equity Interests of each such Company to be
purchased by the Buyer or by a single designee of the Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Buyer represents that the Buyer is a corporation for the purposes of
Section 338 of the Code and that any designee of the Buyer shall be a
corporation for the purposes of Section 338 of the Code (or a disregarded
entity owned by an entity that is a corporation for the purposes of Section
338 of the Code). The Buyer shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all incremental state
income tax liability of the Seller and its Affiliates resulting from the
breach of the forgoing representation; _provided_ that the maximum amount
recoverable by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) shall not exceed
$2,500,000; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Buyer shall not be liable to the
Seller for any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.3(d)
unless and until the aggregate amount of incremental state income taxes that
may be recovered from the Seller pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) exceeds
$200,000. The indemnification provided in this Section 6.3(d) shall be the
sole remedy for breach of the representation in this Section 6.3(d). In the
event of any claim by any state taxing authority for additional state income
taxes indemnified under this Section 6.3(d), the Seller shall contest such
claim and the Buyer and the Seller shall jointly control such contest.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Section 338 Election for Foreign Subsidiaries_. Except for CTC
Asia Limited and STR France, Buyer shall make an election under Section 338(g)
with respect to every foreign Subsidiary organized outside the United States
(and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in making such election and shall take
such actions as reasonably requested by the Buyer to make such election).

 



 

Section 6.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Buyer, the Companies, the
Representative and each Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Return
of any Company; (ii) assist in any audit or other Action with respect to Taxes
or Returns of any Company (whether or not a Tax Matter); and (iii) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Return, that are necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.
The Buyer and the Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to Taxes, including, without limitation, access to books
and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Returns, the
making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
Governmental Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax. The Buyer, the Companies, the Representative,
and the Sellers will retain, and will cause their Affiliates to retain, for
the full period of any statute of limitations all books and records, documents
and other information with respect to Pre-Closing Period Taxes. At the end of
such period, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice before transferring, destroying or discarding any such
books and records, during which period the Seller can elect to take
possession, at the expense of the Seller, of such books and records. The
Sellers shall provide the Buyer with any information reasonably necessary for
the Buyer, the Companies, and any Affiliates of the foregoing to comply with
any information reporting requirements under the Code or other applicable Laws
or to complete any Return in accordance with the Code or any applicable Laws.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers shall provide the Buyer with any
information reasonably necessary to allow the Buyer to comply with Code
Section 6043A.

contemplated by the Contribution Agreement or the Foreign Contribution
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid equally by the
Buyer and the Seller.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer shall notify each other within thirty (30) days
of receipt of written notice of any inquiries, claims, actions, suits,
assessments, audits or similar proceedings or Actions with respect to Taxes of
the Companies relating to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period (a " _Tax
Matter_ "). Any failure or delay to so notify the other party of any Tax
Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability with respect to
such Tax Matters except to the extent such failure or delay materially
adversely affects the interest of the party.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall have the right (at Sellers sole cost and expense) to
assume and control the defense, conduct and settlement of any Tax Matter
(including, without limitation, administrative appeals, claims for refund,
suits filed in any court, the execution of any waiver of any statute of
limitation with respect to any taxable year ending on or before the Closing
Date, filing court action, appeals and settlements) that relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Matter at its the sole expense. Without
the other partys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, delayed or denied, neither party may settle, resolve, concede or
otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter; provided, however, the Seller shall
not be required to obtain the consent of Buyer for U.S. federal or state
income Tax Matters for any Pre-Closing Tax Period if the Seller pays all of
the resulting liability at the time of such settlement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Prior to the Closing Date, all
agreements by and among any Company, on the one hand, and any other Person, on
the other hand, with respect to the sharing of Taxes and Tax benefits shall be
cancelled such that no Company shall have any obligation thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Amended Tax Returns or Retroactive Elections_. The Buyer shall
not, and shall not allow any Company to, make any retroactive election in
respect of Taxes that would impact any Pre Closing Period, in each case
without the express written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood that a
failure to provide consent where such amendment or election is required by Law
would be considered to have been unreasonably withheld) unless the Buyer
agrees that the Seller is not liable for any Taxes as a result of any such
amendment or election.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Exclusivity_. The provisions of this Article VI shall not be
governed by the limitations contained in Article VIII (other than Section 8.1
and Section 8.6(b)(i)) and to the extent there is a conflict between this
Article VI and Article VIII, the provisions of this Article VI shall control.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Chinese Tax Matters_. The Seller will fulfill any information
filing obligation pursuant to Circular 698 as a result of the direct or
indirect transfer of STR (Shanghai) Ltd.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.12 _Indemnity Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall not be entitled to any indemnity pursuant to Section 6.1(d)
for a breach of a representation in Section 3.17(r) unless and until the
aggregate liability of Seller for any such breach would exceed $25,000.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall not be entitled to any indemnity pursuant to Section 6.1(d)
for a breach of a representation in Section 3.17(s) unless and until the

for GAAP purposes but unpaid as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Dividends/Distributions_. To the extent a dividend or
distribution paid after the Closing to a holder of record prior to the Closing
Date does not constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Seller agrees to (or, as applicable, cause its Affiliates or
other applicable holder to) include all such dividends or distributions in
income in the Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date
(either as a dividend, gain, as an inclusion under subpart F or otherwise),
and the Buyer agrees to take positions on its Tax Returns (and, as applicable,
cause its Affiliates and the Companies to take positions on their Tax Returns)
that are consistent with such treatment. If any taxing authority challenges
such treatment and proposes the inclusion of such dividends or distributions
in income of the Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Companies in Tax
periods, or portions of Tax periods, beginning after the Closing Date) or any
other Buyer Indemnified Party (including as an inclusion under subpart F or
otherwise), the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer, its Affiliates
(including the Companies) or any other Buyer Indemnified Party against any
Taxes that may result from such challenge. At the Sellers request, the Buyer
shall (at Sellers cost and expense) contest any such finding by any taxing
authority and allow the Seller to participate in such contest. The Buyer shall
not settle any such contest without the written consent of the Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses to the
extent resulting from:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer contained
in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Buyer contained in this
Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, the Foreign Contribution Agreement or
the Trademark License Agreement; or

 



 

(c) any Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Shared Pre-Closing Losses_. The Buyer shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Shared Pre-Closing Losses until the aggregate amount of Shared
Pre-Closing Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims
arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances equals or exceeds
$25,000, in which case, the Seller shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all of such excess
aggregate Shared Pre-Closing Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties
and the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement as a result of a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if
known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however,
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in

 



      
 

 



 

the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by
its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, and which releases the
Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the
Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation
of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.7 shall govern Tax Contests and this
Section 8.5 shall not apply to such Tax Contests.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Article VIII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Business Material Adverse Effect, Buyer Material Adverse Effect,
Seller Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or
otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) No claim may be asserted against either party for breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written notice
of such claim is received by such party, describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or
prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which
such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.1, in which

 



   

     
 

 



 

case such representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim
until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from the Seller by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
and the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from the Buyer by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
in each case, shall be $27,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , that any
Losses resulting from breaches by the Seller or the Buyer of any of the Core
Representations, Tax Representations or Environmental Representations shall
not be subject to the Cap and such Losses shall not count towards satisfaction
of the Cap; _provided_ _further_ , that the aggregate amount of all
indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Seller by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article VI or Sections 8.2(a) or (c) or from
the Buyer by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.3(a)
(including, in each case, with respect to any Losses resulting from breaches
of any Core Representation) shall not exceed, in each case, the Purchase
Price; _provided_ _further_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall
not apply to any indemnifiable Losses resulting from any Excluded Liabilities
or Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(ii) the Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Seller
equals or exceeds $2,500,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), in which case the
Seller shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount,
and the Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Buyer
equals or exceeds the Deductible Amount, in which case the Buyer shall be
liable only for the Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in each case, that no Losses may be claimed by any Buyer
Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by
the Seller or the Buyer or shall be included in calculating the aggregate
Losses for purposes of this clause (ii) other than Losses in excess of
$250,000 (the " _Minimum Loss Amount_ ") resulting from any single claim or
aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances;
_provided_ _further_ , that Losses resulting from any breaches by the Seller
or the Buyer of Core Representations, Tax Representations or Environmental
Representations shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount or the Minimum
Loss Amount and shall instead be recoverable from the first dollar thereof;
_provided_ _further_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the Deductible Amount
and the Minimum Loss Amount shall not apply to any indemnifiable Losses
resulting from any Excluded Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(iii) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss to the extent that a specific accrual or
reserve for the amount of such Loss was reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet;

 



 

(iv) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss to the extent that the Buyer received a benefit
from

 



      
 

 



 

the reflection of such matter in the calculation of the adjustment of the
Purchase Price, if any, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3;

 



 

(v) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or
income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach
or alleged breach of this Agreement, and no "multiple of profits" or "multiple
of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in calculating
the amount of any Losses;

 



 

(vi) in the event the Seller proceeds with the Closing notwithstanding actual
knowledge by the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller at or prior to the
Closing of any breach by the Buyer of any representation, warranty or covenant
in this Agreement, no Seller Indemnified Party shall have any claim or
recourse against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to such breach, under this Article VIII or otherwise; and

 



 

(vii) in the event the Buyer proceeds with the Closing notwithstanding actual
knowledge by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer at or prior to the
Closing of any breach by the Seller of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any claim or
recourse against the Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to such breach, under this Article VIII or otherwise.

 



 

(c) For all purposes of this Article VIII, "Losses" shall be net of any
insurance or other recoveries payable to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification.

 



 

(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim, liability or Loss for which indemnification may be
required hereunder, including by making, or causing the applicable Indemnified
Party to make, all reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim, liability or
Loss. In the event that the Buyer or the Seller shall fail to make such
reasonable efforts, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any
Person for any claim, liability or Loss that could reasonably be expected to
have been avoided if such efforts had been made. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Buyer and the Seller shall, or shall cause
the applicable Indemnified Party to, use reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as
they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives
any payment from the Seller in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 8.2
and the Buyer Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such
Losses from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Party
shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or
warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
are necessary to permit the Seller to recover from the Potential Contributor
the amount of such payment. If any such assignment would afford the Potential
Contributor any defense to the payment of the same, such assignment shall not
take place and the Buyer Indemnified Party will, at the Sellers direction

 



      
 

 



 

and expense, take all reasonable actions to seek to recover such claim from
such Potential Contributor. Any payment received in respect of such claim
against the Potential Contributor (whether by the Seller or the relevant Buyer
Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be
distributed, (a) first, to the Buyer Indemnified Party in the amount of any
deductible or similar amount required to be paid by the Buyer Indemnified
Party prior to the Seller being required to make any payment to the Buyer
Indemnified Party plus, in the case of any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the costs and expenses
incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such
claim, (b) second, to the Seller in an amount equal to the aggregate payments
made by the Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such claim,
plus the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending
or otherwise addressing such claim and (c) the balance, if any, to the Buyer
Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Exclusivity_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, subject to the foregoing, Article VI and this Article
VIII will provide the exclusive remedy against the Seller for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
effective as of the Closing, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other
Buyer Indemnified Parties, waives any other claims any Buyer Indemnified Party
may have against the Seller relating to the Business, the Companies and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) After the Closing, subject to the foregoing, Article VI and this Article
VIII will provide the exclusive remedy against the Buyer for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating
to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, and effective
as of the Closing, the Seller, on behalf of itself and the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, waives any other claims any Seller Indemnified Party may
have against the Buyer relating to the Business, the Companies and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the party so
requesting termination shall have complied with Section 5.9.

Section 10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Subject to _Section 10.10_, Each
of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement brought by the other party or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, provided that if jurisdiction is not then available
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal action

in any appropriate Delaware state or federal court), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court in Delaware, as described herein. Each of
the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware, as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

and disclosures contained in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be

Section 10.14 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may assign any of its rights under
this Agreement, including the right to purchase all or any portion of the
Equity Interests, to one or more of Buyers Affiliates, without the prior
consent of the Seller; _provided_ _further_ , that the Seller may assign any
of its rights under this Agreement, including the right to receive the
