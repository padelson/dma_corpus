            cancelled in accordance with Section 3.2(b)(iii) or held by any
            Dissenting Stockholder (as defined in Section 3.5 hereof)), shall be
            automatically converted into the right to receive that number of
            shares of Source Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as
            defined below), subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6,

            cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall
            cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock

            interest, Source Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
            of Source Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable
            thereon to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the

                  (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and held in
            the Company's treasury or by any subsidiary of the Company at the
            Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be
            outstanding and shall be canceled and retired without payment of any

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them below:

                  (i) The "EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean the quotient obtained by
            dividing (x) the Aggregate Share Number by (y) sum of (A) the
            Outstanding Company Common Amount plus (B) the Outstanding Company
            Option Amount, each of (x) and (y) as specified in the Final
            Capitalization Certificates.

                  (ii) The "OUTSTANDING COMPANY COMMON AMOUNT" shall mean the
            aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
            immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all shares of
            Company Common Stock into which the Company Preferred Stock shall be
            converted prior to such time.

                  (iii) The "OUTSTANDING COMPANY OPTION AMOUNT" shall mean the
            aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable,
            directly or indirectly, upon exercise of all unexpired and
            unexercised options, warrants, convertible securities or other
            rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, shares of Company Common
            Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares of
            Company Common Stock into which the Company Preferred Stock, if any,
            may be converted as of such time).

      3.3 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of the capital stock of the Company,

            (a) Each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (each a
      "COMPANY OPTION") issued pursuant to the Company's 1999 Equity
      Participation Plan, the Company's 1999 Employee Equity Participation and
      Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated Digital On-Demand, Inc. 1998
      General Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated Digital
      On-Demand, Inc. 1998 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (each a "COMPANY
      OPTION PLAN"), whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger
      and regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, be assumed by
      Source. Each Company Option so assumed by Source under this Agreement
      (each such option, an "ASSUMED OPTION") will become exercisable in
      accordance with its terms, for that number of shares of Source Common
      Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of
      Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, rounded to the
      nearest whole number of shares. The per share exercise price of the
      Assumed Option will equal the per share exercise price of such Company
      Option, divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent.
      No cash will be paid in lieu of

                                                                             -5-
<PAGE>

      fractional shares that are rounded pursuant to this Section 3.3. Any
      Company Option exercisable prior to the Effective Time, in whole or in
      part, for Company Preferred Stock shall become exercisable for Source
      Common Stock in accordance with the preceding four sentences (as if the
      Company Preferred Stock underlying such Company Option has been converted
      to Company Common Stock in accordance with the conversion rate applicable
      to the shares of such series of Company Preferred Stock). Prior to the
      Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to pay out
      any cash amounts which are currently due to certain holders of Company
      Options. In connection with any spin-off or other distribution by the
      Company to its stockholders of the Company's ownership interest in the
      Spinco Business, each Company Option will be adjusted, if necessary, in
      accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plan or option agreement
      under which it was granted. Each Company Option Plan will be assumed by
      Source in accordance with Section 7.12(c). Prior to the Effective Time,
      the Company shall take all action necessary under the Company Option Plans
      or otherwise, to permit Source to assume the Company Options and shall
      have provided any notices to optionees required under the Company Option
      Plans or other agreements.

            (b) The term, exercisability, vesting schedule, and all other terms
      of each Assumed Option will be the same in all material respects as the
      corresponding Company Option other than for the delivery of Source Common
      Stock and any adjustment in the number of shares issuable and the exercise
      price. Continuous employment with the Company will be credited to holders
      of Assumed Options received upon Source's assumption of Company Options
      for purposes of determining the vesting of such Assumed Options from and
      after the Effective Time except to the extent the holder is no longer
      employed by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

            (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Source shall
      deliver to each holder of an outstanding Assumed Option an appropriate
      document evidencing the assumption of the holder's Company Options by
      Source. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than
      thirty (30) days thereafter, Source shall file one or more registration
      statements on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares
      of Source Common Stock subject to such Assumed Options (to the extent such
      a registration statement is available for such options) and shall use
      commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
      registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
      current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
      long as such options remain outstanding. Source shall take all corporate
      action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
      Source Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Assumed Options
      pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 3.3.

            (d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase
      shares of Company Capital Stock (each a "COMPANY STOCK WARRANT") shall by
      virtue of the Merger be assumed by Source. Each Company Stock Warrant so
      assumed by Source under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
      subject to, the same terms and conditions of such warrant immediately
      prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Stock Warrant
      will be exercisable for the number of shares of Source Common Stock equal
      to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Company

                                                                             -6-
<PAGE>

      Common Stock issuable directly or indirectly upon exercise of the Company
      Stock Warrant, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Source
      Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
      Source Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock
      Warrant will equal the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
      issuable directly or indirectly under such Company Stock Warrant divided
      by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. No cash will be
      paid in lieu of fractional shares that are rounded down pursuant to this
      Section 3.3. Source shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
      for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Source Common Stock for
      delivery upon exercise of all Company Stock Warrants pursuant to the terms
      set forth in this Section 3.3.

            (e) Prior to the Distribution, the Company shall issue the number of
      shares of Common Stock and Series A2 Preferred Stock set forth on Section
      3.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to those Company stockholders
      identified therein pursuant to the Company's obligations under Section 3.4
      of the Contribution Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between the
      Company, the Principal Stockholder, DOD Merger Sub, Inc. and Digital
      On-Demand.

      3.4 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES EVIDENCING COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The
procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

            (a) As of the Effective Time, Source shall deposit, or shall cause
      to be deposited, with Source's transfer agent, or with such other
      institution designated by Source as is reasonably satisfactory to the
      Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of shares
      of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article III,
      certificates evidencing the shares of Source Common Stock and cash in lieu
      of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Source
      Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
      thereto (relating to record dates for such dividends or distributions
      after the Effective Time), being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE
      FUND") to be issued pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof and paid pursuant to
      this Section 3.4 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
      Stock.

            (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
      Source shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
      shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
      (including shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
      Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) (i) a
      letter of transmittal in customary form which shall specify that delivery
      of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be effected, and risk of loss
      regarding and title to such shares of Company Common Stock shall pass,
      only upon delivery of the Certificates evidencing such shares to the
      Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
      such Certificates in exchange for certificates evidencing shares of Source
      Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and any
      dividends and distributions payable thereon. Upon surrender of a
      Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
      duly executed

                                                                             -7-
<PAGE>

      letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
      requested by the Exchange Agent, the holder of the shares evidenced by
      such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
      certificate evidencing that number of whole shares of Source Common Stock
      and a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares
      (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder),
      if any, and any dividends or distributions payable thereon pursuant to the
      provisions of this Article III (after giving effect to any withholding tax
      required by law to be withheld by Source) and the shares evidenced by the
      Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
      be paid or accrued on cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or
      distributions payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
      Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an
      "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the
      Securities Act shall not be exchanged until Source has received an
      Affiliate Letter from such person.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
      contrary, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant
      to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
      fraction of a share of Source Common Stock (after taking into account all
      Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares
      of Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall, upon surrender of such
      holder's Certificates, receive, in lieu of such fraction of a share, cash
      (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share
      of Source Common Stock multiplied by the average of the closing sales
      prices of shares of Source Common Stock as reported by the Nasdaq National
      Market ("NASDAQ") during the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on
      and including the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.

            (d) Dividends and other distributions declared after the Effective
      Time on Source Common Stock issued hereunder shall be paid to the holder
      surrendering a Certificate as contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
      no such dividends or other distributions so declared shall be paid in
      respect of any shares of Source Common Stock evidenced by a Certificate
      until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein.
      Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
      Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
      evidencing whole shares of Source Common Stock issued in exchange
      therefor, without interest at the time of such surrender, the amount of
      dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
      Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Source
      Common Stock and not yet paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes
      required by law to be withheld by Source.

            (e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
      the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common
      Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
      the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
      registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
      evidencing the proper number of shares of Source Common Stock, together
      with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares and any
      dividends or distributions payable thereon, may be issued to the
      transferee thereof if the Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock
      is presented to the Exchange Agent

                                                                             -8-
<PAGE>

      accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
      and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
      If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
      Entity, the Surviving Entity shall return such Certificates to the
      holder(s) thereof and shall require that such holder(s) comply with the
      procedures set forth in this Article III.

            (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
      investments thereof and any shares of Source Common Stock) that remains
      unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the
      Effective Time shall be returned to Source and any holder of Company
      Common Stock who has not previously complied with Article III shall
      thereafter look only to Source as a general unsecured creditor for payment
      of its claims for Source Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
      shares of Source Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
      respect thereto.

            (g) None of Source, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange
      Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares
      of Company Common Stock for any shares or amounts delivered to a public
      official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
      laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2)
      years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
      on which any Source Common Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of
      such Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder
      of such Certificate pursuant to this Article III would otherwise escheat
      to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such Source
      Common Stock or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
      Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
      property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest
      of any person previously entitled thereto.

            (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
      destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit with respect thereto by the
      Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
      required by Source or its transfer agent, the making of an indemnity
      and/or posting of a bond by such Person in such reasonable amount as
      Source may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
      it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in
      exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a certificate
      representing the shares of Source Common Stock and cash in lieu of
      fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
      Source Common Stock in respect thereof, deliverable in respect thereof
      pursuant to this Agreement.

            (i) Each of the Exchange Agent, Source and the Surviving Entity
      shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
      deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
      shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines
      that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
      such payment under the Code, or any other applicable provision of state,
      local or foreign tax law or any other applicable legal requirement. To the
      extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
      treated for all purposes

                                                                             -9-

      of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
      would have otherwise have been delivered.

      3.5 DISSENTER'S RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock, if any, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand for appraisal of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (a "DISSENTING
STOCKHOLDER") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
consideration provided in Section 3.2 hereof at or after the Effective Time,
unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal under the DGCL. A Dissenting
Stockholder may receive payment of the fair value of the shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by such Dissenting Stockholder ("DISSENTING SHARES") in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL, provided that such Dissenting Stockholder complies with
Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and cease to exist and shall represent only the right to receive the
fair value thereof in accordance with the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholder's right to appraisal, such
Dissenting Stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger consideration set forth in Section 3.2 hereof. The Company shall give
Source (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands
for appraisal and any other instruments served under the DGCL and (b) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations, proceedings or settlements with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall
not, except with Source's prior written consent, settle or offer to settle any
such demands.

      3.6 ADJUSTMENT OF EXCHANGE RATIO. In the event that, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Source Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class as a result of the Reincorporation (as defined below), a
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
split, combination, exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

      3.7 DISTRIBUTION OF SPINCO BUSINESS. The parties intend for the Spinco
Business of the Company to be spun off or otherwise distributed in its entirety
to the stockholders of the Company. It is a condition to Source's obligation to
consummate the Merger that the Distribution be completed. The terms of the
Distribution will be determined by the Company; provided, however, that Source's
consent shall be required in connection with any material deviation from the
terms and conditions of the Distribution described in Appendix A and shall be
required as to the final form and content of each of the agreements identified
in Appendix A, which consent in either case shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                                                                            -10-

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                   OF SOURCE

      Except as set forth in the schedules delivered to the Company prior to or
simultaneously with the execution hereof (collectively, the "SOURCE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"), Source represents and warrants to the Company that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date. The sections of the Source Disclosure Schedule setting
forth exceptions to the representations and warranties contained in this Article
IV are numbered and lettered to correspond to the applicable sections and
subsections of this Article IV, and shall only qualify the corresponding
sections or subsections of this Article IV and any other subsections of this
Article IV to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to the other

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Source is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have and would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Source Material Adverse Effect. Source has
delivered or made available to the Company a complete and accurate copy of the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, of Source, all of
which documents are in full force and effect.

      4.2 CAPITALIZATION.

            (a) The authorized capital stock of Source consists of 40,000,000 of
      Source Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value

      Source SEC Reports, as of November 15, 2004 (i) 23,565,090 shares of
      Source Common Stock, were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Source
      Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and (iii) 100,000 shares of
      Source Common Stock and no shares of Source Preferred Stock were held in
      the treasury of Source. All outstanding shares of Source Common Stock are
      duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are
      free of any preemptive or other similar rights.

            (b) Section 4.2(b) of the Source Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
      complete and accurate list, as of November 15, 2004, of all stock option
      plans or other share or equity-related plans of Source (the "SOURCE OPTION
      PLANS"), indicating for each Source Option Plan, as of the date of this
      Agreement, the number of shares of Source Common Stock issued to date
      under such plan, the number of shares of Source Common Stock subject to
      outstanding options under such plan (the "SOURCE OPTIONS") and the number
      of shares of Source Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the
      plan.

            (c) Section 4.2(c) of the Source Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
      complete and accurate list, as of November 15, 2004, of each outstanding
      option issued other than pursuant to the Source Option Plans (the "SOURCE
      OFF-PLAN OPTIONS") and each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of
      Source Common Stock (each a "SOURCE WARRANT"). Except pursuant to the
      Source Options, the Source Off-Plan Options and the

                                                                            -11-
<PAGE>

      Source Warrants, (i) no subscription, warrant, option, convertible
      security or other right (contingent or otherwise) to purchase or acquire
      any shares of Source is authorized or outstanding, (ii) Source has no
      obligation (contingent or otherwise) to issue any capital stock,
      subscription, warrant, option, convertible security or other such right,
      or to issue or distribute to holders of any of its shares any evidences of
      indebtedness or assets of Source, (iii) Source has no obligation
      (contingent or otherwise) to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
      its shares or any interest therein or to pay any dividend or to make any
      other distribution in respect thereof and (iv) there are no outstanding or
      authorized share appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with
      respect to Source. None of the outstanding options or rights or warrants
      (including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
      security, instrument or other agreement) shall accelerate and vest in
      connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
      or upon the actual or constructive termination of employment by Source
      following the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (d) (i) There are no agreements, written or oral, between Source or
      any Affiliate of Source and any holder of the securities of Source
      relating to the sale or transfer (including agreements relating to rights
      of first refusal, co-sale or "drag-along' rights) or registration under
      the Securities Act (including any rights to include securities in the
      Registration Statement) with respect to the capital stock of Source, (ii)
      there are no proxies, voting rights or other agreements or understandings
      between Source or any Affiliate of Source and any holder of the securities

      Source, with respect to the voting or transfer of the capital stock of
      Source, (iii) there is no rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover
      plan or other similar agreement or understanding to which Source is a
      party or by which it is bound with respect to the capital stock of Source,
      (iv) Source is not obligated to redeem or otherwise acquire any of its
      outstanding shares of capital stock and (v) there have been no shareholder
      proposals received for inclusion in the proxy statement for the next
      Source annual shareholder meeting. The Merger and the transactions
      contemplated by this Agreement will not have the effect of increasing the
      number of shares of Source capital stock issuable pursuant to any
      unexercised options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights to
      acquire Source capital stock.

            (e) All outstanding shares of Source are, and all shares of Source
      Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Article III above will be
      upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
      pursuant to which they are issuable, duly authorized, validly issued,
      fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive or other similar
      rights.

      4.3 SUBSIDIARIES. Source does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or other ownership interest in any Person. Each Subsidiary of Source
(including Merger Sub) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation and has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and each
Subsidiary of Source is qualified to do business, and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation, in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

                                                                            -12-
<PAGE>

qualified and in such good standing will not have or could not reasonably be
expected to have, when taken together with all other such failures, a Source
Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding shares of capital stock and other
equity securities or interest of each Subsidiary of Source are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and
all such shares are owned, of record and beneficially, by Source or another of
its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any and all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in Source's voting rights, charges or
other encumbrances of any nature, except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities laws. Source is not subject to any obligation or requirement to
provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any of its Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding
or authorized options, warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which
Source or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which are binding on any of them
providing for the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital stock of
any Subsidiary of Source. There are no outstanding stock appreciation, phantom
stock or similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary of Source. There are no
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of Source. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities, has no material
liabilities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this
Agreement.

      4.4 POWER AND AUTHORITY; NON-CONTRAVENTION; GOVERNMENT APPROVALS.

            (a) POWER AND AUTHORITY. The execution and delivery of this
      Agreement and the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement by Source and the Merger Sub have been duly and validly
      authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of Source
      and Merger Sub, subject only to (x) the required receipt of Source
      Stockholder Approval (as defined below), and (y) the filing and
      recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and the
      LLC Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Source
      Board, at a meeting duly called and held (and not subsequently rescinded
      or modified in any way) and by the vote of directors (i) determined that
      the Merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Source and

      Source Common Stock in the Merger, (iv) approved the Reincorporation and
      the Reincorporation Filings (each as defined in Section 6.5 below), (v)

      directed that the Source Voting Proposal be submitted to the stockholders
      of Source for their approval and resolved to recommend that the
      stockholders of Source vote in favor of the Source Voting Proposal.
      Assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
      obligation of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and
      legally binding obligation of Source and Merger Sub, enforceable against
      Source and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such
      enforcement may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, fraudulent
      conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
      affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
      (ii) general equitable principles, regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

                                                                            -13-
<PAGE>

      For purposes of this Agreement, (1) "SOURCE VOTING PROPOSAL" shall mean,
      collectively, the proposal for approval of: (i) the issuance of the Source
      Common Stock in the Merger (the "SHARE ISSUANCE") and the other
      transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) an amendment to Source's
      Articles of Incorporation which shall, among other things, increase the
      authorized shares of Source Common Stock from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000
      (the "ARTICLES AMENDMENT") and (2) "SOURCE STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL" shall
      mean the approval of the Source Voting Proposal by the requisite vote of
      Source's stockholders under Source's Articles of Incorporation, the rules
      of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., the General Business and Corporation Law
      of Missouri (the "GBCLM") and other applicable laws.

            (b) NON-CONTRAVENTION. Subject to obtaining Source Stockholder
      Approval and compliance with the requirements specified in Section 4.4(c),
      the execution and delivery by each of Source and Merger Sub of the
      Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the performance by each of
      Source and Merger Sub of its obligations under such Transaction Documents
      and the consummation by each of Source and Merger Sub of the transactions
      contemplated by such Transaction Documents shall not: (i) conflict with,
      or result in a violation or breach of, any provision of the articles of
      incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or certificate
      of formation, as applicable, thereof, (ii), conflict with, or result in a
      violation or breach of, any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
      decree, writ, injunction, judgment or order of any Governmental Authority
      or any arbitration award which is applicable to, binding upon or
      enforceable against Source or Merger Sub, as the case may be, (iii)
      constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time, or
      both would reasonably be expected to become a default or give rise to a
      right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
      loss of material benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under, any
      agreement, contract, lease, note, mortgage, indenture, loan agreement,
      franchise agreement, employment agreement, instrument or legally binding
      undertaking material to the business, assets, properties or operations of
      Source or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or (iv) result in or require the
      creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the
      property or assets thereof, except in each of the cases of (ii) through
      (iv) for any such contravention, violation, conflict, breach, default,
      event or Lien that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
      Source Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.4(b) of the Source Disclosure
      Letter lists all consents, waivers and approvals under any of Source's or
      any of its Subsidiaries' agreements, licenses or leases required to be
      obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated hereby which, if individually or in the aggregate were not
      obtained, would result in a material loss of benefits to Source or the
      Surviving Entity as a result of the Merger.

            (c) GOVERNMENT APPROVALS. No declaration, filing or registration
      with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any
      Governmental Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this

      contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of
      Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection
      with the Merger and the appropriate documents with the relevant
      authorities of other states or jurisdictions in which Source and Merger
      Sub are qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable
      requirements of the HSR Act and any

                                                                            -14-

      Registration Statement with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act

      the Exchange Act, (v) the filing of such reports, schedules or materials
      under Section 13 or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act and materials under
      Rule 165 and Rule 425 of the Securities Act as may be required in
      connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
      (vi) such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations,
      consents or approvals as may be required under applicable federal, foreign
      and state securities ("BLUE SKY") laws, (vii) the filing of the Nasdaq
      Notification Form: Listing of Additional Shares with respect to Nasdaq,
      (viii) the filing of the Reincorporation Filings in connection with the
      Reincorporation, and (ix) such declarations, filings, registrations,
      notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or
      obtained, as the case may be, would not have a Source Material Adverse
      Effect.

            (d) REQUIRED VOTE. The affirmative votes for adoption of the Source
      Voting Proposal by, (i) in the case of the Share Issuance, the holders of
      a majority of the votes cast on the Share Issuance and (ii) in the case of
      the Articles Amendment, the holders of a majority of the outstanding
      shares of Source Common Stock on the record date for the meeting of
      Source's stockholders to consider the Source Voting Proposal (the "SOURCE
      MEETING") are the only votes of the holders of any class or series of
      Source capital stock or other securities necessary to adopt this Agreement
      and for consummation by Source of the other transactions contemplated by
      this Agreement. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
      indebtedness of Source having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
      exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
      which stockholders of Source may vote.

      4.5 REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; INFORMATION PROVIDED.

            (a) Since January 1, 2001, Source has filed or otherwise furnished
      with the SEC all forms, registration statements, prospectuses, proxy

      with all forms, statements, reports and documents which shall be filed
      subsequent to the date hereof up to the Closing, being referred to herein,

      Reports and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
      or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
      circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Source's
      Subsidiaries is, and none of Source's Subsidiaries at any

                                                                            -15-

      time since January 1, 2001 has been, required to file or otherwise furnish
      any form, report, registration statement or prospectus with or to the SEC.

            (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements included in the
      Source SEC Reports, together with the notes and schedules related thereto
      (collectively, the "SOURCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), as of their respective
      dates (or if amended or supplemented in a Source SEC Report filed prior to
      the date of this Agreement, as of the date amended or supplemented), (i)
      complied in all material respects with the applicable accounting
      requirements as set forth in the published rules and regulations of the
      SEC, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent
      basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
      notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited interim
      financial statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the
      Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects the
      consolidated financial position of Source and its Subsidiaries as of the
      respective dates of the balance sheets included therein and the results of
      operations and changes in financial position for the respective periods
      indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements are
      subject to lack of footnotes and normal and recurring year-end adjustments
      and any other adjustments described therein not material in amount.

            (c) Each of Source and its Subsidiaries maintains accurate books and
      records reflecting its assets and liabilities and maintains proper and
      adequate internal accounting controls which provide reasonable assurance
      that (i) transactions are executed with management's authorization; (ii)
      transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
      consolidated financial statements of Source in accordance with GAAP and to
      maintain accountability for Source's consolidated assets; (iii) access to
      Source's assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
      authorization, (iv) the reporting of Source's assets is compared with

      and timely basis and (vi) there are adequate procedures regarding
      prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
      disposition of Source's assets. As of the date of this Agreement, (i)

      Source's internal controls over financial reporting which could adversely
      affect in any material respect Source's ability to record, process,
      summarize and report financial data or material weaknesses in internal
      controls over financial reporting and (ii) there has been no fraud,
      whether or not material, that involved management or other employees of
      Source or any of its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in Source's
      internal controls over financial reporting.

            (d) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of Source for
      inclusion or incorporation by reference in the registration statement on
      Form S-4 to be filed by Source pursuant to which shares of Source Common
      Stock issuable in connection with the Merger shall be registered under the
      Securities Act (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), shall not at the time the
      Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
      therein not misleading. The information to be supplied by or on behalf of
      Source for inclusion in the proxy

                                                                            -16-

      the Company seeking written consent of the Company Voting Proposal) or as
      of the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in
      light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any
      material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Proxy
      Statement/Prospectus not false or misleading, or omit to state any
      material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
      communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Source
      Meeting or the Company Meeting (or the solicitation of the stockholders of
      the Company seeking written consent of the Company Voting Proposal)which
      has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective
      Time, any fact or event relating to Source or any of its Affiliates should
      be discovered by Source or should occur which should be set forth in an
      amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
      Statement/Prospectus, Source shall promptly inform the Company of such
      fact or event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Source makes no
      representation or warranty with respect to the information to be supplied
      by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement
      or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

            (e) Source has implemented such programs and has taken such steps it
      believes are reasonably necessary to provide for its upcoming compliance
      (not later than the relevant statutory and regulatory deadline therefore)
      with all provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
      ("SOX") that shall become applicable to Source and has not received,
      orally or in writing, any notification that its auditor believes that
      management will not likely be able to complete its assessment before the
      reporting deadline, or if completed, that it will not likely be completed
      in sufficient time for the auditor to complete its assessment.

      4.6 ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Neither Source nor any of its
Subsidiaries have any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet
or in the related notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in

events) of termination of employment following a transaction involving Source of
the nature contemplated by this Agreement; or (n) agreed to do or authorized any

Source nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is in violation of, or
has been given notice or been charged with any violation of, any law, statute,
order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment (other than matters related to
the environment) of any Governmental Authority, except for violations which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Source Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Source, no material investigation or review by any Governmental
Authority is pending or threatened involving Source or its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub). Each of Source and each of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub) has all permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations of, and
registrations with and under, all federal, state, local and foreign laws, and
from all applicable Governmental Authorities, required thereby to carry on its
businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to have any such

                                                                            -18-

Source Material Adverse Effect.

Taxes not yet due and payable) upon the assets of Source or any of its
Subsidiaries, and Source has no knowledge of any basis for the assertion of any
claim relating to or attributable to Taxes which, if adversely determined, would
result in a Lien upon the assets of Source or any of its Subsidiaries.

      (b) Neither Source nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated by any
contract, agreement or other arrangement to indemnify any other person with
respect to material Taxes. Neither Source nor any of its Subsidiaries are now or

not written and including, without limitation, any arrangement required or
permitted by law) binding Source or any of its Subsidiaries that (i) requires
Source or any of its Subsidiaries to make any Tax payment to or for the account
of any other person, (ii) affords any other person the benefit of any net
operating loss, net capital loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit,
charitable deduction or any other credit or Tax attribute which could reduce
Taxes (including, without limitation, deductions and credits related to
alternative minimum Taxes) of Source or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii)
requires or permits the transfer or assignment of income, revenues, receipts or
gains to Source or any of its Subsidiaries, from any other person, in each case
other than with respect to each other.

has never been a member of an affiliated group of corporations, within the
meaning of Section 1504 of the Code, other than as a common parent corporation,
and none of Source's Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations, within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), except where Source was the common
parent corporation of such affiliated group.

      (g) Neither Source nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for the
Taxes of any person other than any of Source or its Subsidiaries, under
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

      (h) As of the Effective Time, there will not be any contract, agreement,
plan or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of Source or any
Subsidiary that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or 162 of the
Code.

      (i) Source and all of its Subsidiaries are in full compliance with all
terms and conditions of any Tax exemptions, Tax holiday or other Tax reduction
agreement or order of a territorial or non-U.S. government and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not have any adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemptions,
Tax holiday or other Tax reduction agreement or order.

      (j) Each of Source and its Subsidiaries is and has at all times been
resident for Tax purposes in their respective place of incorporation or
formation and is not and has not at any time been treated as resident in any
other jurisdiction for any Tax purpose (including any double taxation
arrangement).

      (k) Neither Source nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of
transactions that the Internal Revenue Service has determined to be a tax
avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation, or other form of
published guidance as a listed transaction, as set forth in Treas. Reg. Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

      4.11 LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. Neither Source nor any of its
Subsidiaries is now, or has been in the past five years, or is in current
negotiations to be, a party to or bound by

                                                                            -20-

any collective bargaining agreement or any other agreement with a labor union;
and, to the knowledge of Source, there has been no effort by any labor union
during the 24 months prior to the date hereof to organize any employees of
Source or any of its Subsidiaries into one or more collective bargaining units.
There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Source, threatened labor, strike or
work stoppage. None of Source, its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Source,
any agent, representative or employee thereof has, within the last 24 months,
committed any unfair labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations
Act, as amended, and there is no pending or, to the knowledge of Source,
threatened charge or complaint against Source or any of its Subsidiaries by or
with the National Labor Relations Board or any representative thereof. There has
been no strike, walkout or work stoppage involving the employees of Source or
any of its Subsidiaries during the 24 months prior to the date hereof. There are
no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to the
knowledge of Source, threatened relating to any labor, safety or discrimination
matters involving any employee, including, without limitation, charges of unfair
labor practices or discrimination complaints, which, if adversely determined,
would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Source Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Source and its Subsidiaries (i) has complied in all material
respects with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to employment,
employment practices, wages and hours, civil rights and equal employment
opportunities, including but not limited to, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the

(ii) has withheld all amounts required by law or agreement to be withheld from
the wages, salaries or other payments to its employees, except as would not

remains unsatisfied and (v) is not liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund or to any Governmental Authority with respect to employment insurance

payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent with past
practices). There are no pending, or to Source's knowledge, threatened claims or
actions against Source under any worker's compensation policy or long-term
disability policy that would result in a material liability to Source. Neither
Source nor Source ERISA Affiliate has direct or indirect liability with respect
to any misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than
as an employee, or with respect to any employee leased from another employer,
except as would not result in material liability to Source.

      4.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

      (a) Section 4.12 of the Source Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate
and complete list of each material Source Employee Benefit Plan and each
material Source Employee Agreement. Neither Source nor any Source ERISA
Affiliate has any plan or commitment to establish any new Source Employee
Benefit Plan or Source Employee Agreement, to modify any Source Employee Benefit
Plan or Source Employee Agreement (except to the extent required by law or to
conform any such Source Employee Benefit Plan or Source Employee Agreement to
the requirements of any applicable law), or to adopt or enter into any Source
Employee Benefit Plan or Source Employee Agreement.

                                                                            -21-

valuations, if any, prepared for each Source Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) the

description together with the summary(ies) of material modifications thereto, if

(vi) all IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters; (vii)
all material communications to any Employee or Employees relating to any Source
Employee Benefit Plan and any proposed Source Employee Benefit Plans, in each
case, relating to any amendments, terminations, establishments, increases or
decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting schedules or other
events which would result in any material liability to Source; (viii) all
material correspondence to or from any governmental agency relating to any
Source Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine correspondence that would not
reasonably be expected to result in liability to Source); (ix) all standard
COBRA forms and related notices (or such forms and notices as required under
comparable law); and (x) the three (3) most recent plan years discrimination
tests for each Source Employee Benefit Plan.

      (c) Source and the Source ERISA Affiliates have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by them under each Source
Employee Benefit Plan, and each Source Employee Benefit Plan has been
established and maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms
and in compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA or the Code. Source does not
now, nor has it ever established or maintained any International Employee Plan.
There are no actions, suits or claims pending, or, to the knowledge of Source or
any Source ERISA Affiliates, threatened (other than routine claims for benefits)
against any Source Employee Benefit Plan or against the assets of any Source
Employee Benefit Plan. Each Source Employee Benefit Plan (other than any stock
option plan) can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to
Source or any Source ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses). There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Source or any Source ERISA Affiliates, threatened by the IRS or
DOL, or any other governmental entity with respect to any Source Employee
Benefit Plan. Source and each Source ERISA Affiliate have timely made all
contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each
Employee Benefit Plan, except as would not have a Source Material Adverse
Effect. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be made or
accrued as of the date hereof to the Source Employee Benefit Plans have been, in
all material respects, timely made or accrued. No "prohibited transaction,"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA,
and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect
to any Source Employee Benefit Plan.

                                                                            -22-
<PAGE>

      (d) Each of Source's Source Employee Benefit Plans intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify
under Section 501(a) of the Code has, since January 1, 2001, obtained a
favorable determination, notification, and advisory and/or opinion letter, as
applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS. For each Source Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
there has been no event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected
or, to the knowledge of Source, is reasonably likely to adversely affect such
qualified status.

      (e) Neither Source nor any Source ERISA Affiliate (including any person or
entity that was a Source ERISA Affiliate in the past) has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any (i) Pension Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii)
Multiemployer Plan or (iii) any plan described in Section 413 of the Code or a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code. Neither Source nor any
Source ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any
Source Employee Benefit Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975
through 4980 of the Code.

      (f) None of the Source Employee Benefit Plans or Source Employee
Agreements provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide
post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any reason,
except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither
Source nor any Source ERISA Affiliate has incurred any commitment or obligation
to provide any Person with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except
to the extent required by statute.

      (g) Neither Source nor any Source ERISA Affiliate has, prior to the
Effective Time and in any material respect, violated any of the health care
continuation requirements of COBRA, the requirements of the Family Medical Leave

Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Women's Health and Cancer
Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns' and Mothers' Health
Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or any similar
provisions of state law applicable to its Employees. No Source Employee Benefit
Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance
contract and neither Source nor any Source ERISA Affiliate maintains a "funded
welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code.

      (h) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Source
Employee Benefit Plan, Source Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee of Source or any Source
ERISA Affiliate.

      (i) No payment or benefit which has been, will be or may be made by Source
or the Source ERISA Affiliates in connection with this transaction (either alone
or upon the occurrence of additional or subsequent events) with respect to any
Source or Source ERISA Affiliate employee will be, or could reasonably be
expected to be, characterized as a "parachute payment," within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code ("SECTION 280G PAYMENTS"). There is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement to which Source or any Source ERISA

                                                                            -23-

      4.14 REAL ESTATE.

      (a) Section 4.14(a) of the Source Disclosure Schedule lists all real
property owned by Source and its Subsidiaries (the "SOURCE OWNED REAL
PROPERTY"). Source, or its Subsidiaries as the case may be, has good,
marketable, and insurable title to the Source Owned Real Property, free and
clear of any Lien (excluding any mortgage or deed of trust that has been
previously disclosed to the Company and reflected on the financial statements of
Source and its Subsidiaries) that would materially and adversely interfere with
its present use.

      (b) With respect to the Source Owned Real Property: (i) there are no
material leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other material agreements
or arrangements, written or oral, granting to any party or parties the right of
use or occupancy of any material portion of the parcel of such Source Owned Real
Property except in favor of Source and its Subsidiaries; (ii) there are no
outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase such Source Owned
Real Property, or any material portion thereof or material interest therein; and
(iii) there are no parties (other than Source and its Subsidiaries) in
possession of a material portion of such Source Owned Real Property.

      (c) The leases, subleases and similar agreements and all amendments
thereto under which Source or any of its Subsidiaries lease real property (each,
a "SOURCE REAL PROPERTY LEASE") are in full force and effect, and have not been
amended (except as disclosed to the Company as set forth above) and neither
Source nor, to the knowledge of Source, any other party thereto is in material
default or material breach thereunder. To Source's knowledge, no event has
occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would
cause a material breach of or material default by Source under any of such
Source Real Property Leases and, to Source's knowledge, there is no material
breach by any other party to the Source Real Property Leases. With respect to
each piece of real property leased by Source and its Subsidiaries (the "SOURCE
LEASED PREMISES" and together with the Source Owned Property, the "SOURCE REAL
PROPERTY"), Source, to Source's knowledge, has valid and enforceable leasehold
interests therein. Source, or its Subsidiaries as the case may be, has good,
marketable, and insurable leasehold interests to the Source Leased Premises,
free and clear of any Lien (excluding any mortgage or deed of trust that has
been previously disclosed to the Company and reflected on the financial
statements of Source and its Subsidiaries) that would materially and adversely
interfere with its present use.

      (d) With respect to the Source Real Property, to Source's knowledge: (i)
such Source Real Property is in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear
excepted, and (ii) Source has not received notice of (A) any condemnation
proceeding with respect to any portion of such Source Real Property or any
access thereto and, to the knowledge of Source, no such proceeding has been
commenced by any Governmental Authority or (B) any special assessment which may
affect such Source Real Property and, to the knowledge of Source, no such
special assessment has been commenced by any Governmental Authority.

      4.15 GOOD TITLE TO AND CONDITION OF ASSETS.

      (a) Each of Source and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to all of
its material Source Assets (as such term is hereinafter defined), free and clear
of any Liens except for (a)

                                                                            -26-

encumbrances, covenants, rights of way, building or use restrictions, easements,
exceptions, variances, reservations and other matters or limitations of any
kind, if any, which do not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Source
Material Adverse Effect. The Source Assets and the Source Leased Premises
constitute, in the aggregate, all of the assets and properties necessary for the
conduct of the business of Source and each of the Subsidiaries in the manner in
which and to the extent to which such business is currently being conducted. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "SOURCE ASSETS" means all of the properties
and assets of Source and the Subsidiaries which are reflected in the Source
Financial Statements or acquired after the date of the Source Financial

ordinary course of business since such date or as otherwise disclosed or
permitted by this Agreement), other than the Source Leased Premises, whether
personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, and wherever located.

      (b) The Source Fixed Assets (as such term is hereinafter defined)
currently in use or necessary for the business and operations of Source and each
of the Subsidiaries are in good operating condition, normal wear and tear
excepted. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "SOURCE FIXED ASSETS" means
all vehicles, machinery, equipment, tools, supplies, leasehold improvements,
furniture and fixtures used, leased or owned by Source or the Subsidiaries
(except assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
or as otherwise disclosed or permitted by the Agreement).

      4.16 INSURANCE. Each of the insurance policies maintained by Source and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "SOURCE INSURANCE POLICIES") are in full
force and effect, and all premiums due thereon have been paid when due, and no
notice of cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or
event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default thereunder. As of the Closing, each of the Source Insurance
Policies will be in full force and effect. None of the Source Insurance Policies
will lapse or terminate as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Section 4.16 of the Source Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
description of any pending claim under any Source Insurance Policy, or any
insurance policy previously in effect, for an amount in excess of $100,000 that
relates to loss or damage to the properties, assets or business of Source.

year has, to the knowledge of Source, threatened to terminate its business
relationship with, or materially decrease purchasing products or services from,
Source or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason. No current supplier or vendor

such Subsidiary, or in any Person from whom or to whom Source or such Subsidiary
leases real or

                                                                            -27-

transaction with Source or any such Subsidiary or has any interest in any
property used by Source or any such Subsidiary.

      4.18 NAMES; PRIOR ACQUISITIONS. All names under which Source and each of
its Subsidiaries does business, as of the date hereof, are specified in Section
4.18 of the Source Disclosure Schedule. Neither Source nor any of its

copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date, of
the Company, all of which documents are in full force and effect. Section 5.1 of

jurisdiction of organization or incorporation and has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on

other such failures, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding shares

on the part of the Company, subject only to (x) the required receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval and (y) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and the LLC Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and

their approval and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company
vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Assuming this Agreement
constitutes valid and legally binding obligations of the Source and Merger Sub,
this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, fraudulent
conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii)
general equitable principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity. For purposes of this Agreement,
(1) "COMPANY VOTING PROPOSAL" shall mean, collectively, the proposal (i) to
adopt this

                                                                            -35-

      (b) NON-CONTRAVENTION. Subject to Company Stockholder Approval and
compliance with the requirements specified in Section 5.4(c), the execution and

with notice or lapse of time, or both would reasonably be expected to become a
default or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of material benefit) under, or require a consent or
waiver under, any agreement, contract, lease, note, mortgage, indenture, loan
agreement, franchise agreement, employment agreement, instrument or legally
binding undertaking material to the business, assets, properties or operations
of the Company or (iv) result in or require the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon or with respect to any of the property or assets of the Company,
except in each of the cases of (ii) through (iv) for any such contravention,
violation, conflict, breach, default, event or Lien that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section
5.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all consents, waivers and
approvals under any of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' agreements,
licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby which, if individually or in the
aggregate were not obtained, would result in a material loss of benefits to the
Company as a result of the Merger.

      (c) GOVERNMENT APPROVALS. No declaration, filing or registration with, or
notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority
is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except

Agreement and for consummation by the Company of the other transactions

pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened relating to any labor,
safety or discrimination matters involving any employee, including, without

claims or actions against the Company under any worker's compensation policy or
long-term disability policy that would result in a material liability to the
Company. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has direct or indirect
liability with respect to any misclassification of any person as an independent

regulations, including but not limited to ERISA or the Code. The Company does
not now, nor has it ever established or maintained any International Employee

Company or any ERISA Affiliates, threatened (other than routine claims for
benefits) against any Employee Benefit Plan or against the assets of any
Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan (other than any stock option
plan) can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective
Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses). There
are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliates, threatened by the IRS or DOL, or any other
governmental entity with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. The Company and
each ERISA Affiliate have timely made all contributions and other payments
required by and due under the terms of each Employee Benefit Plan, except as
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All contributions, reserves or
premium payments required to be made or accrued as of the date hereof to the
Employee Benefit Plans have been, in all material respects, timely made or

event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is reasonably likely to adversely affect such
qualified status.

      (e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate (including any person or

established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any (i) Pension Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii)
Multiemployer Plan or (iii) any plan described in Section 413 of the Code or a

nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through
4980 of the Code.

      (f) No Employee Benefit Plan or Employee Agreement provides, or reflects
or represents any liability to provide post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or
other applicable statute, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has

ERISA Affiliate maintains a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code.

      (h) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Employee

payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any Employee.

      (i) No payment or benefit which has been, will be or may be made by the
Company or its ERISA Affiliates in connection with this transaction (either
alone or upon the occurrence of additional or subsequent events) with respect to
any Employee will be, or could reasonably be expected to be, characterized as a

which the Company or any ERISA Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound to
compensate any Employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code as a result of this transaction (either alone or upon the occurrence of
additional or subsequent events).

      5.14 REAL ESTATE.

      (a) Section 5.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all real
property owned by the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries (the "OWNED REAL
PROPERTY"). The Company, or the Acquired Subsidiaries as the case may be, has
good, marketable, and insurable title to the Owned Real Property, free and clear
of any Lien (excluding any mortgage or deed of trust that has been previously
disclosed to Source and reflected on the financial statements of Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries) that would materially and adversely interfere with its
present use.

      (b) With respect to the Owned Real Property: (i) there are no material
leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other material agreements or
arrangements, written or oral, granting to any party or parties the right of use
or occupancy of any material portion of the parcel of such Owned Real Property
except in favor of the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries; (ii) there are no
outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase such Property, or any
material portion thereof or material interest therein; and (iii) there are no
parties (other than the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries) in possession of

      (c) The leases, subleases and similar agreements and all amendments
thereto under which the Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries lease real
property (each, a "COMPANY REAL PROPERTY LEASE") are in full force and effect,
and have not been amended (except as disclosed to Source as set forth above) and
neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto is in material default or material breach thereunder. To the Company's
knowledge, no event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both, would cause a material breach of or material default by the
Company under any of such Company Real Property Leases and, to Company's
knowledge, there is no material breach by any other party to the Company Real
Property Leases. With respect to each piece of real property leased by the
Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY LEASED PREMISES" and
together with the Company Owned Property, the "COMPANY REAL PROPERTY"), the
Company, to Company's knowledge, has valid and enforceable leasehold interests
therein. The Company, or the Acquired Subsidiaries as the case may be, has good,
marketable, and insurable leasehold interests to the Company Leased Premises,
free and clear of any Lien (excluding any mortgage or deed of trust that has
been previously disclosed to Source and reflected on the financial statements of
Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries) that would materially and adversely
interfere with its present use.

such Company Real Property is in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear
excepted, and (ii)

                                                                            -46-

the Company has not received notice of (A) any condemnation proceeding with
respect to any portion of such Company Real Property or any access thereto and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceeding has been commenced by any
Governmental Authority or (B) any special assessment which may affect such
Company Real Property and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such special
assessment has been commenced by any Governmental Authority.

      5.15 GOOD TITLE TO AND CONDITION OF ASSETS.

(e) other title defects, encumbrances, covenants, rights of way, building or use
restrictions, easements, exceptions, variances, reservations and other matters
or limitations of any kind, if any, which do not and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Assets and the Leased
Premises constitute, in the aggregate, all of the assets and properties
necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and each of the
Acquired Subsidiaries (other than the Spinco Business) in the manner in which
and to the extent to which such business is currently being conducted (assuming

permitted by this Agreement including without limitation, the Distribution),
other than the Leased Premises, whether personal or mixed, tangible or
intangible, and wherever located.

      (b) The Company Fixed Assets (as such term is hereinafter defined)
currently in use or necessary for the business and operations of the Company and
each of the Acquired Subsidiaries (other than the Spinco Business) are in good
operating condition, normal wear and tear excepted. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "COMPANY FIXED ASSETS" means all vehicles, machinery,
equipment, tools, supplies, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures used,
leased or owned by the Company or the Acquired Subsidiaries (except assets sold
or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise
disclosed or permitted by this Agreement including without limitation, the
Distribution).

      5.16 INSURANCE. Each of the insurance policies maintained by the Company
and the Acquired Subsidiaries (collectively, the "COMPANY INSURANCE POLICIES")
are in full force and effect, and all premiums due thereon have been paid when
due, and no notice of cancellation has been received, and there is no existing
default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default thereunder. As of the Closing, each of the Company
Insurance Policies will be in full force and effect. None of the Company
Insurance Policies will lapse or terminate as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a description of any pending claim under any

                                                                            -47-

leases real or personal property. No officer, director or stockholder of the
Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries, nor any Person related by blood or
marriage to any such officer, director or stockholder, nor any entity in which
any such officer, director or stockholder owns any beneficial interest, is a
party to any agreement or transaction with the Company or any such Acquired
Subsidiary or has any interest in any property used by the Company or any such
Acquired Subsidiary.

any terms of such Intellectual Property Contracts.

      (c) The Company has all right, title and interest to each item of Company
Intellectual Property purported to be owned by it, including all Registered
Company Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Liens. The Company
Intellectual Property constitutes all of the intellectual property necessary to
conduct the business of the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries as currently

other Person. To the Company's knowledge, no Person is infringing upon,
misappropriating or violating any of the Company Intellectual Property.

embodying the Company Intellectual Property, is subject to any proceedings or
outstanding decree, order, judgment or stipulation restricting in any manner the
use or licensing thereof by the Company, or which may affect the validity or
enforceability of any Intellectual Property. There is no claim, suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries (i) alleging any such conflict,
infringement or violation with any other Person's proprietary rights or (ii)
challenging such the Company's ownership or use of, or the validity or
enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property owned or used by the
Company.

      (g) To the Company's knowledge, (i) no other Person asserts ownership
rights in any of the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of the

infringes any right of any third party.

      (h) Each of the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries has taken reasonable
steps to protect its rights in its confidential information and trade secrets or
any trade secrets or confidential information of third parties provided thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries has and enforces a policy requiring each employee and
contractor with access to Intellectual Property of the Company or

agreement substantially in the Company's standard form as then in effect and all
current and former employees and contractors of the Company and each such

(i) none of the Company Intellectual Property has been used, disclosed or
appropriated to the detriment of the Company for the benefit of any Person other
than the Company or the Acquired Subsidiaries, and (ii) no employee, independent
contractor or agent of the Company has misappropriated any trade secrets or
other confidential information of any other Person in the course of the
performance of his or her duties as an employee, independent contractor or agent
of the Company.

foregoing, Source shall be permitted to: (i) execute and deliver a merger
agreement or other appropriate transaction document to effect the
Reincorporation, and consummate the transactions contemplated therein, (ii)
adopt a Certificate or Articles of Merger and file such Certificate or Articles
with the Secretary of State of Delaware or other state reasonably determined by
Source's Board of Directors to effect the Reincorporation, (iii) file and record

agreements and instruments, containing provisions that are appropriate or
customary for public companies, including, without limitation, indemnification
agreements for officers and directors, and (v) have Source's Board of Directors
take all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
applicable to a "business combination" will not apply to the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement or the Source Voting Agreements or to the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Reincorporation (such items contained in subsections
(ii) and (iii) hereof being defined as "REINCORPORATION FILINGS"). The Company's
consent shall be required in connection with the final form and content of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving Delaware entity in the
Reincorporation and other agreements to be entered into in connection with the
Reincorporation, which, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      consummate the Merger.

            (b) The parties hereto acknowledge that Source and the Company have

            with, or (B) disclose or provide any non-public information relating

                  (iii) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle with
            any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,

provided, however, that prior to (1) in the case of the Company, obtaining the
approval of the Company Voting Proposal at the Company Meeting (or by written
consent of the stockholders of the Company) or (2) in the case of Source,
obtaining the approval of the Source Voting Proposal at the Source Meeting, the
Company or Source, as applicable, and its Representatives may take any of the
actions described in clause (ii) of this subsection (a) in response to any
Person that has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if, but only if,
(A) such Person has submitted a written Acquisition Proposal which did not
result from a violation by the Company or Source, as applicable, of its
obligations under this Section 7.2, (B) the Company Board or the Source Board,
as applicable (the "APPLICABLE BOARD"), has determined in good faith by
resolution duly adopted, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such

                                                                            -60-
<PAGE>

Superior Proposal, (C) in the case of Section 7.2(a)(ii)(B), such Person has
entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company or Source, as
applicable on terms that are no less favorable to the other than the
Confidentiality Agreement (which shall not preclude discussions or negotiations
with the Company or Source, as applicable, relating to the proposal or offer
from such Person required by this Section 7.2 and which shall not contain any
exclusivity provision or other term that could restrict in any manner the other
party's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
and (D) prior to, or substantially concurrent with, disclosing or providing any
such non-public information, the Company or Source, as applicable, shall
disclose or provide all such information to the other.

            (b) Each of the Company and Source shall promptly advise the other,
      in writing (and in any event within one business day of attaining
      knowledge), of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal,
      inquiry or request related to, or that could reasonably be expected to
      lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Company and Source shall
      promptly provide the other, in writing, with the terms and conditions of
      any such Acquisition Proposal, or such proposal, inquiry or request, and
      the identity of the Person making the same. Each of the Company and Source
      shall promptly inform the other of any material changes in the status and
      any material changes or modifications in the terms of any Acquisition
      Proposal, proposal, inquiry or request. Promptly upon determination by the
      Applicable Board that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
      Proposal, the Company or Source, as applicable, shall deliver to the other
      a written notice advising them that the Applicable Board has so
      determined, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
      and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, and
      providing the other party with a copy of the Superior Proposal.

            (c) The Source Board has adopted a resolution recommending the
      approval of this Agreement and the issuance of the Source Common Stock in
      the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the
      stockholders of Source (the "SOURCE RECOMMENDATION"), and, except as
      provided in the next sentence, the Board of Directors of Source shall at
      all times maintain the Source Recommendation. The Source Board shall be
      permitted to (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company (or
      not to continue to make) the Source Recommendation, (ii) approve or
      recommend a Superior Proposal, and/or (iii) enter into an agreement
      regarding such Superior Proposal if, but only if, (a) a majority of the
      Source Board has determined in good faith, following consultation with
      outside counsel, that taking such action is required in order for the
      members of the Source Board to comply with their fiduciary duties to the
      stockholders of Source under applicable law, (b) Source has given the
      Company three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
      take such action, and Source shall have considered in good faith, with
      respect to actions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
      Section 7.2(c), any proposed changes to this Agreement proposed by the
      Company (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
      financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal, if any, shall
      require a new three (3) Business Day period to afford the Company the
      opportunity to negotiate with Source), and (c) Source has materially
      complied with its obligations under this Section 7.2 with respect to such
      Superior Proposal, if any. Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall prohibit
      Source or the Source

                                                                            -61-

      or otherwise, (b) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
      reorganization, share exchange, sale of all or substantially all assets,

      the fair market value of the assets of Source or the Company, as
      applicable, and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (c) any transaction

      Antitrust Law, provided, that, nothing in this Section 7.4 shall require
      either Source or the Company (i) to license, sell, divest or dispose of
      any material assets or businesses of Source or the Company or any of their

      action that limits in any material respect the freedom of action with
      respect to, or the ability to retain, any of the assets or business of the
      Company or Source or their respective Subsidiaries. The parties hereto
      will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
      the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
      presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made

to give prompt notice to the other such party of, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy (a) the occurrence or failure to occur of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the representations or warranties of the Company or Source, as the
case may be, in this Agreement to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a Source Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, and (b) any failure on
the part of the Company or Source, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, agreement or condition to be complied with or satisfied thereby

      Proposal and the Company Voting Proposal, respectively, and shall submit
      the Source Voting Proposal and the Company Voting Proposal, respectively,
      to their respective stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such
      proposal whether or not (i) the Source Board, at any time subsequent to
      the date hereof determines, in the manner permitted by Section 7.2(c),
      that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the
      stockholders of Source reject it, or (ii) any actual, potential or
      purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has been commenced,
      disclosed, announced or submitted to Source.

            be comprised of eleven directors, to consist of six members of the
            Source Board designated by Source (including the current Chairman
            and Chief Executive Officer of Source, S. Leslie Flegel and Ariel
            Emanuel) before the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, three
            of whom must be "independent" under the rules of the NASD and the
            SEC with respect to Source (the "SOURCE DESIGNATED DIRECTORS") and
            five individuals designated by the Company (three of whom must be
            "independent" under the rules of the NASD and the SEC with respect
            to Source) before the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the
            "COMPANY DESIGNATED DIRECTORS"). Such directors shall be initially
            appointed as follows: (A) three Company Designated Directors to the
            class whose term expires at the 2005 annual meeting of Source
            shareholders, (B) one Company Designated Director and three Source
            Designated Directors to the class whose term expires at the 2006
            annual meeting of Source shareholders and (C) one Company Designated
            Director and three Source Designated Directors to the class whose
            term expires at the 2007 annual meeting of Source shareholders. If
            any Source Designated Director or Company Designated Director shall
            be unable or unwilling to serve as a director at the Effective Time,
            the party that designated such individual as indicated above shall
            designate another individual to serve in such individual's place.

                  (ii) COMMITTEES. As soon as reasonably practicable following
            the Effective Time, the Source Board will take all actions necessary
            to cause the membership of each its standing committees (i) to
            include one Company Designated Director and (ii) to be comprised of
            a majority of Source Designated Directors, each to the extent that
            such individual's membership on a given committee is permitted by
            the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq and
            consented to by the individual.

            (b) Immediately following the Effective Time, the executive officers
      of Source shall be comprised of Alan Tuchman, who shall be appointed as
      Executive Vice President, and the following current officers of Source: S.
      Leslie Flegel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; James R. Gillis,
      President and Chief Operating Officer; Jason S. Flegel, Executive Vice
      President, John A. Amann, Executive Vice President and Marc Fierman, Chief
      Financial Officer.

            (c) The Source Board shall amend its Bylaws effective at the
      Effective Time, to, among other things, (i) provide that the Source Board
      shall consist of between three (3) and eleven (11) directors, with the
      exact number to be specified by resolution approved by Supermajority Board
      Approval; (ii) provide that the consummation of a Change of Control (as
      defined in Article XI) or any further amendment to the Bylaws shall
      require Supermajority Board Approval; (iii) until the Minimum Holding
      Date, provide that if any Company Designated Director or Stockholder
      Designated Director is

                                                                            -67-
<PAGE>

      unable to fulfill his or her term in office, for whatever reason, either
      as a result of death, resignation, retirement or removal, then the
      remaining Company Designated Directors and the Stockholder Designated
      Directors shall have the exclusive right to designate an individual to
      fill such vacancy; and (iv) until the Minimum Holding Date, provide that
      if any Source Designated Director is unable to fulfill his or her term in
      office, for whatever reason, either as a result of death, resignation,
      retirement or removal, then the remaining Source Designated Directors
      shall have the exclusive right to designate an individual to fill such
      vacancy (the "BYLAWS AMENDMENT").

            (d) Immediately following the Effective Time, the executive
      headquarters of Source and the Surviving Entity shall be located in Bonita
      Springs, Florida and the operating headquarters of the Surviving Entity
      shall be in Coral Springs, Florida.

      7.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; TERMINATION OF PLANS; STOCK OPTION PLANS.

            (a) Following the Effective Time, Source will give each employee of
      the Company who continues as an employee of the Surviving Entity
      immediately following the Merger (a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE") full credit for
      prior service with the Company or the Acquired Subsidiaries for purposes
      of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Source employee benefit plans,
      (ii) determination of benefits levels under any Source employee benefit
      plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (iii) determination
      of "retiree" status under any Source employee benefit plan, in each case
      for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the
      Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such
      crediting would (A) result in a duplication of benefits or (B) otherwise
      cause Source or its Subsidiaries or any Source employee benefit plan or
      trust relating thereto to accrue or pay for benefits that relate to any
      time period prior to the Continuing Employee's participation in the Source
      employee benefit plan. Source agrees that each otherwise eligible
      Continuing Employee shall be eligible to either: (i) participate in Source
      employee benefit plans as permitted by the terms of such Source employee
      benefit plans, (ii) participate in Employee Benefit Plans or Employee
      Agreements that are continued by Source, or (iii) a combination of clauses
      (i) and (ii) so that each Continuing Employee is eligible for benefits
      that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those of similarly
      situated employees of Source.

            (b) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
      Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all group severance,
      separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements and any
      and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement that
      Source elects to terminate by providing written notice to the Company
      within a reasonable time prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
      "COMPANY TERMINATING PLAN(S)"). Source agrees that the Continuing
      Employees shall be eligible to participate, to the extent they were
      eligible to participate in the Company Terminating Plan, in a comparable
      Source plan, program or arrangement, as promptly following the Effective
      Time as is permitted by the terms of such Source plan, program or
      arrangement. If Source provides such notice to terminate the Terminating
      Plan(s) to the Company, no later than three business days prior to the
      Effective Time, the Company shall provide Source with evidence that such
      Company Terminating Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than
      the day immediately preceding the Effective Time)

                                                                            -68-
<PAGE>

      pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company
      shall take such reasonable actions as required by Source to effect the
      provisions of this Section 7.12(b).

            (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Source will assume all
      Company Option Plans. The Company shall take such reasonable actions prior
      to the Effective Time as are reasonably necessary to effect the provisions
      of this Section 7.12(c), including taking such actions as may be required
      to confirm that the Source Board of Directors (or its committee) shall,
      effective as of the Effective Time, become the administrator of the
      assumed Company Option Plans and shall have any and all amendment
      authority with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
      agree that the assumption by Source of the Company Option Plans in
      accordance with this Agreement does not adversely affect the rights of the
      holders of options under such Company Option Plans.

            (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
      necessary under the Company Option Plans or otherwise to permit Source to
      assume the Company Options in accordance with Section 3.3 and shall have
      timely provided any notices to optionees required under the Company Option
      Plans or other agreements.

      7.13 AFFILIATE AGREEMENT. At least 30 days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Source a list of names and addresses of those persons
who were, in the reasonable judgment of Source and the Company, at the record
date for such party's stockholders' meeting to approve the Merger, "affiliates"
(as that term is used in Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act including
those individuals listed in Section 7.13 of Company Disclosure Schedule). The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each "affiliate"
so identified who has not previously delivered an Affiliate Agreement to Source
to deliver to Source, on or prior to the Effective Time, an Affiliate Agreement.
Source shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates
evidencing the Source Common Stock to be received by the Company's affiliates
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stock transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the Source Common Stock, to the effect
that the shares received or to be received by such Company affiliate pursuant to
this Agreement may only be sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or in accordance
with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Rule 145 or pursuant to an exemption
from registration provided under the Securities Act.

      7.14 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS'
INSURANCE.

            (a) Source shall cause all rights to indemnification existing in
      favor of those Persons who are officers and directors of the Company and
      the Acquired Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (the
      "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
      Effective Time, whether provided in the Company's Certificate of
      Incorporation, bylaws or other charter documents (as in effect as of the
      date of this Agreement) or as provided in indemnification agreements
      between the Company or an Acquired Subsidiary set forth on Section 7.14 of
      the Company Disclosure Schedule and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect
      as of the date of this Agreement) to survive the

                                                                            -69-

      Merger and be observed by Source or the Surviving Entity to the fullest
      extent permitted by the DGCL until not earlier than the sixth anniversary
      of the Effective Time.

            (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
      Effective Time, Source shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide
      officers' and directors' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
      omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
      Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and
      directors' liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, in
      an amount, on terms, and with scope of coverage comparable to those
      applicable to such policy; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
      foregoing, the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an aggregate
      premium on such insurance policy for such entire six (6) year period that
      is greater than 300% of the annual premium payable under the Company's
      directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof;
      and provided further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Source
      may satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.14 by purchasing a "tail"
      policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance
      policy. If notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts to
      do so, Source is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for in
      this Section 7.14(b), the Surviving Entity shall obtain as much comparable
      insurance as available for the maximum amount set forth in the preceding
      sentence.

            (c) The provisions of this Section 7.14 are intended to be in
      addition to the rights otherwise available to the Indemnified Persons by
      law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the
      benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons,
      and their respective heirs and representatives.

      7.15 CONVERSION OF COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK. The Company shall effect a
conversion of all outstanding Company Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time.

      7.16 CAPITALIZATION CERTIFICATE. Ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Source Meeting: (i) Source shall furnish the Company with a certificate from its
appropriate officers setting forth a true and correct calculation of the
Aggregate Share Number and (ii) the Company shall furnish Source with a
certificate from its appropriate officers setting forth the true and correct
estimate of the capitalization of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, after giving effect to all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company
Preferred Stock and the conversion of all Company Preferred Stock, setting forth
(A) the Outstanding Company Common Amount as of the Effective Time and (B) the
Outstanding Company Option Amount (each a "CAPITALIZATION CERTIFICATE"). In the
case of the Company's Capitalization Certificate, Company shall include a list
naming each record holder of Company Common Stock, Company Option, Company
Warrant or other right, the number of shares held or subject to such Company
Option, Company Warrant or other right (in each case after giving effect to all
accrued and unpaid dividends on the Company Preferred Stock and the conversion
of all Company Preferred Stock) and the best available address known to the
Company for each security holder. Each Capitalization Certificate, together with
such mutually agreed modifications, shall serve as the basis for the
capitalization certificate to be delivered at the Closing (each, a "FINAL
CAPITALIZATION CERTIFICATE").

                                                                            -70-

      agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have any such
      injunction lifted.

      of the representations and warranties of Source all "Source Material
      Adverse Effect" qualifications and other qualifications based on the word

      satisfactory to it to the effect that the Merger will constitute a

<PAGE>

                                 APPENDIX A(1)


         Certain of the Company's direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
engage in the business of developing and licensing entertainment databases and
kiosk-based products and selling related products and services. In connection
with and as a condition to the Merger, these businesses will be reorganized and
contributed, sold or otherwise transferred to Digital On-Demand, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and/or one or more other existing or
newly created, direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company (other than DFS,
as defined below, or its subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Digital Entities"),
including, at the Company's election and without limitation, through the initial
transfer of the shares of a Digital Entity to DFS or its subsidiaries; the
Company may contribute, sell or otherwise transfer the shares and other
securities of one or more Digital Entities to other Digital Entities; the
Digital Entities may engage in certain additional transactions among themselves;
and the shares and other securities of the Digital Entities will be spun-off or
otherwise distributed to the stockholders of the Company (together with the
steps contemplated by Section I below, the "Distribution"). This appendix sets
forth the general terms of the Distribution.

I. STRUCTURE OF THE SPIN

         AEC One Stop Group, Inc. ("AEC One Stop") is a wholly-owned, indirect
subsidiary of the Company. A portion of the businesses included in the
Distribution is operated as a division (the "All Media Guide Division") within
AEC One Stop. As part of the Distribution, AEC One Stop will cause substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of the All Media Guide Division consistent
with Section II below (as well as any additional assets and/or liabilities
related to the All Media Guide Division that are held under AEC One Stop) and
the assets and liabilities of All Media Guide, Inc. (collectively, the "AMG
Items") to be reorganized and contributed, sold or otherwise transferred to the
Digital Entities (and All Media Guide, Inc. will be dissolved or otherwise
included in Spinco, as defined below), including, at the Company's election and
without limitation, through the initial transfer of the shares of a Digital
Entity to DFS or its subsidiaries. It is currently contemplated that such
reorganization and contribution, sale or other transfer will be effected through
(1) the transfer of the AMG Items to a newly-formed LLC ("AMG LLC"), through
contribution, entity conversion or otherwise, (2) AEC One Stop's distribution of
all of its interest in and to AMG LLC to Distribution & Fulfillment Services
Group, Inc. ("DFS"), a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (3) DFS's
distribution of all of its interest in and to AMG LLC to the Company, (4) the
Company's contribution, sale or other transfer of all of its interest in and to
AMG LLC to the Digital Entities, and (5) the Company's distribution of the
shares and other securities of the Digital Entities, which shall also include
the interests of AMG LLC (collectively, "Spinco"), to its stockholders. As noted
above, at the Company's election, certain of the foregoing steps may be effected
through the initial transfer of the shares of a Digital Entity to DFS or its
subsidiaries. In addition, the Company may contribute, sell or otherwise
transfer the shares and other securities of one or more Digital Entities to
other Digital Entities; and the Digital Entities may engage in certain
additional contribution, sale or other transactions among themselves.

----------

(1) Terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the Agreement.

         The transactions comprising the Distribution will occur in such order
as is selected by the Company. The consummation of the Distribution will occur

                  property leases set forth in Item 3 above;

         10.      All receivables outstanding on the Spin Date that arose in the
                  ordinary course of the Spinco Business on or prior to the Spin
                  Date to the extent related solely to the Spinco Business;

         11.      The existing files, books and records of the Spinco Business

                  goods, prepayments, prepaid expenses, advances, claims, choses
                  in action, rights of recovery, rights of set-off, and rights
                  to refunds, in each case, related solely to the Spinco

                  Business;

                  and any other tradenames, copyrights and patents related

         19.      All goodwill related solely to the Spinco Business.

         To the extent that there are additional assets used solely in the
conduct of the Spinco Business, such assets will be included in the assets to be
spun off on the Spin Date. The term "related solely to the Spinco Business"
shall not be negated by the provision of any service of the Spinco Business to
or on behalf of the Company.

         To the extent there are shared assets, Spinco and the Company will
provide terms in the separation agreement and enter into a Transition Services
Agreement and/or License Agreement to give access to/benefit of certain assets
to Spinco. The agreement between the parties shall not constitute an assignment
of any asset or the assumption of any liability if such an assignment or
assumption would constitute a breach or default under the agreement or adversely
affect the rights or increase the obligations of the parties. The Company and
Spinco shall enter into reasonably cooperative arrangements as may be reasonably
acceptable to both to provide for or impose upon Spinco the benefits of any
asset or the obligations of any liability. To the extent that there are
agreements that are shared between the Company and Spinco, the parties will
enter into reasonably cooperative arrangements to permit performance under such
agreements and to


                                       3
<PAGE>


allocate payments received or to be made or the obligation or liabilities
thereunder in an equitable manner if not separately identified in the agreement.
Each party shall cooperate with the other to give access to or copies of any
books or records that may be reasonably requested as relevant to the other
party's ongoing businesses, including prior tax records. The retention of
records shall be coordinated between the parties. If a pre-closing obligation to
a third party has not been performed by the Company, and after the Spin Date,
Spinco has the assets uniquely capable of performing such obligation, then
Spinco, at the Company's request, shall satisfy the obligation to the third
party and the Company shall reimburse Spinco for its cost of performance.

         Spinco will assume: (i) all current liabilities incurred and expenses
accrued relating solely to the Spinco Business, (ii) all liabilities, claims or
actions arising from the operation of the Spinco Business on and after the Spin
Date, including on-going obligations under any assigned contract or any shared
contract to the extent allocable to Spinco for services received or rendered by
Spinco after the Spin Date, (iii) accrued vacation, personal days and floating
holidays of the Spinco employees as of the Spin Date; and (iv) tax liabilities
as set forth in the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement (the "Assumed
Liabilities"). The current liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2004 are
listed in Exhibits 8 and 9, and the Company will update those exhibits as of the
Spin Date.


         Any liabilities and obligations of the Company not described in the
immediately preceding paragraph as Assumed Liabilities shall be the sole
responsibility of the Company. In particular, Spinco shall not assume and shall
have no liability or obligations of the Company as follows: (i) payment or other
allocations with respect to income taxes (except as provided below) for periods
prior to the Spin Date; (ii) the GECC loan and any intercompany amounts; (iii)
any pending litigation, including the Muze litigation; and (iv) any liabilities,
claims or actions arising from the operation of the Spinco Business prior to the
Spin Date, other than for items identified in clause (i) and (iii) of the
preceding paragraph.


         The Company expects that some or all of the Distribution will be a
taxable transaction at the corporate level. The Company will utilize
consolidated NOLs and other attributes, to the extent available after offset
against operating income of the consolidated group, to shelter the gain on the
Distribution. NOLs will be absorbed pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sections 1.1502-21
and -21T. Spinco shall indemnify the Company with respect to certain tax
consequences of the Distribution, as described in Section III(3) below.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the month-end immediately following the
Distribution, the Company shall have a Tangible Net Worth (as defined below) of
at least $20.7 million (the "Measurement Date"). The balance sheet used for the
calculation of Tangible Net Worth shall be the Company's monthly internally
generated consolidating balance sheet, prepared in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Company, excluding all assets and liabilities of SBU 2
(Information Services Group ("AMG")) and SBU 3 (Digital Media Infrastructure
Group ("Digital on Demand") except the amount classified as Revolving Credit
Facility in SBU 2 and SBU 3, which represent AMG and Digital on Demand
intercompany amounts and thus should be reclassified to Due From Affiliates from
Revolving Credit Facility (the "Intercompany Receivable") (the "Balance Sheet").
"Tangible Net Worth", calculated from the Balance Sheet, shall mean Total Assets
less Total Liabilities less amounts classified as Due From Affiliates ("DFA")
less Intercompany Receivable less amounts classified as Investments in
Subsidiaries ("IIS") (DFA, Intercompany Receivable and IIS shall collectively be
referred to as the "Intercompany Amounts") less amounts classified as
Reorganization Value in Excess of


                                       4
<PAGE>


Amounts Allocable to Identifiable Assets ("Reorganization Value") less amounts
classified as Goodwill less amounts classified as Deferred Financing Costs
(Reorganization Value, Goodwill and Deferred Financing Costs shall collectively
be referred to as the "Intangible Amounts"). The calculation on Measurement Date
shall be computed in a manner consistent with the calculation set forth on
Attachment A hereto. For purposes of this calculation, intangibles related to
capitalized software costs should not reduce Tangible Net Worth. Tangible Net
Worth shall exclude, to the extent accrued, expensed, or paid at the Measurement
Date, transaction expenses related to the Merger, including the $4 million
transaction fee payable to Yucaipa and professional fees payable to Munger
Tolles & Olson and Pricewaterhouse Coopers. In the event that the Company would
otherwise have a Tangible Net Worth of less than $20.7 million, Spinco shall
elect to assume such additional liabilities (which shall be included in the
"Assumed Liabilities") or forego such current assets as necessary to ensure such
minimum Tangible Net Worth. Amounts not defined in the definition of Tangible
Net Worth shall refer to amounts classified on the Company's monthly balance
sheet.

         If the Company has insurance coverage applicable to any Assumed
Liabilities, it shall cooperate with Spinco to make the benefits of such
coverage available to Spinco.

         For a period of two years after the Spin Date, Spinco and the Company
will agree not to solicit (other than through a general advertisement or
non-specific means) each other's employees or consultants or independent
contractors who devote all or substantially all of their time to Spinco or the
Company, as applicable.

         Except for personnel in the accounting and legal areas, those employees
who currently devote substantially all of their time to the Spinco Business will
be offered employment by Spinco after the Distribution. A list of the current
employees is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

III. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPINCO AND THE COMPANY AFTER THE DISTRIBUTION

Spin Date. Spinco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate the

cooperate with one another to separate the Spinco Business and the Company's
business as soon as practicable.


         The Company will bill Spinco for the transition services at an
aggregate rate of $25,000 per month. To the extent that Spinco terminates any
service area on fifteen days' notice, then the fee shall be reduced by the
amount for such service area as set forth on Exhibit 10. If Spinco's use of the
time of the personnel in any service area is expected to exceed that which is
set forth on Exhibit 10, then the parties shall discuss increasing the fee in a
manner consistent with the assumptions made to calculate the amounts set forth
in Exhibit 10; provided, however, Spinco shall not be obligated to pay any
increased fee unless it agrees in writing. The Company shall not be obligated to
provide any services in excess of those set forth on Exhibit 10 in the absence
of any fee arrangement.

         Recognizing that the Company is not in the business of providing the
services contemplated by this transition/shared services agreement, and that it
is performing such services at cost, the Company shall not be liable for any
services provided thereunder absent its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
In no event shall either party be entitled to incidental, special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages.

provide that for a period of one year from the Spin Date, Spinco will not engage
in the business of distribution and fulfillment of prepackaged, physical VHS,
CDs or DVDs containing audio or video files or other prepackaged, physical
products containing audio or video files, provided, however, the foregoing shall
not include video games. The noncompete shall not bind an acquirer of Spinco's
assets through an asset acquisition or any other successor to Spinco's business
that would not otherwise be bound by operation of law.

4. Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement

         Spinco and the Company will enter into a tax sharing and
indemnification agreement, which will address, among other items:

         (a) The Company's inclusion of the income of Spinco (including any
deferred items triggered into income by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13)
on the Company's consolidated federal income Tax Return (and any comparable
state returns) for all periods through the date of the Distribution, and the
payment of any Taxes attributable to such income. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice. The Company and
Spinco shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of such Tax Returns,


                                       6
<PAGE>


provided that Spinco shall control the reporting of the Distribution, and Spinco
shall have the right to review and approve the portions of any such Tax Returns
relating to the Company's pre-Distribution activities, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall not amend any material
Tax Return that includes any period prior to or including the Distribution
without the approval of Spinco if such amendment relates to the reporting of the
Distribution, would result in an indemnity obligation on the part of Spinco or
would otherwise reduce Spinco's NOLs or other attributes, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

         (b) The indemnity to be provided by Spinco to the Company for any Taxes
payable by the Company with respect to the Distribution (which shall include
each of the steps comprising part of the Distribution, including those steps
described in Section I (Structure of the Spin) of this Appendix A) for the
taxable year in which the Distribution occurs (including, primarily, Taxes
resulting from the failure of the Company's consolidated NOLs or other
attributes to fully offset any gain arising from the Distribution). For the
avoidance of doubt, such indemnity shall not extend to Taxes (including any
Taxes attributable to any reduction in the Company's consolidated NOLs or other
attributes as a result of the Distribution) arising from transactions or
activities of the Company other than the Distribution. If the Distribution and
Merger transactions occur in the same taxable year, such indemnity shall not
include any Taxes to the extent attributable to a reduction in the Company's
consolidated NOLs or other attributes due to transactions or activities of
Salamander or transactions or activities of the Company for such year that are
properly allocable to the portion of the year following the Merger. The Company
shall reduce (or to the extent previously paid by Spinco to the Company,
promptly pay back to Spinco) the amount of any indemnity claim for Taxes payable
by the Company with respect to the Distribution by the value of any Tax benefit
actually realized by the Company as a result of any losses generated by the
Distribution not otherwise allocated to Spinco pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sections
1.1502-21 and -21T. The Company shall have no obligation to file any amended Tax
Return in order to realize any such Tax benefit;

         (c) The indemnity to be provided by the Company to Spinco with respect
to any Taxes of the Company or its subsidiaries payable by Spinco as a result of
the application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law); and

         (d) The conduct of any audits and contests relating to the Company's
Taxes. The Company shall allow Spinco and its counsel to participate (at
Spinco's expense) in any audit of the Company's Tax Returns to the extent
related to the Distribution or the Company's pre-Distribution activities if such
audit relates to the reporting of the Distribution or the resolution of such
items would result in an indemnity obligation on the part of Spinco or would
otherwise reduce Spinco's NOLs or other attributes, and shall not settle any
such audit or contest in a manner that would adversely affect Spinco (including
by modifying the taxation of the Distribution to the Company's shareholders,
increasing its liability under the indemnity described in paragraph (b) above or
reducing Spinco's NOLs or other attributes), without the approval of Spinco,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

         (e) The term of the indemnity provisions. The indemnity provisions will
expire on the date that is 30 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

5. Indemnification Agreement.

         The Company and Spinco will enter into an Indemnification Agreement at
or prior to Spin Date, which will provide that Spinco will indemnify, defend and
hold the Company and its affiliates and successors harmless against any and all
liabilities, in perpetuity, relating to or arising out of the Assumed
Liabilities, other than tax liabilities.

6. Survival of Agreements

         Each of the agreements shall provide that the agreements, obligations
and rights of each party shall be binding on successors and assigns and contain
a covenant that it shall not consummate any transaction in which another entity
becomes the owner of 50% or more of the equity interests of such party unless
the acquiror and any ultimate parent entity shall have executed and delivered to
the other party an agreement confirming that such acquiror and/or ultimate
parent entity shall, upon consummation of such transaction, cause the relevant
party to continue to perform under the terms of such agreement.

IV. OPTIONS

         In order to account for the reduction in value to the Company
attributable to the Distribution, the Company may adjust each outstanding option
to acquire the Company's capital stock. Consequently, the exercise price of each
option may be reduced and the number of shares for which each such option is
exercisable may be correspondingly increased to preserve the intrinsic value of
the adjusted award as compared to the original award. Furthermore, those
employees of the Company that are either terminated or accept employment with
Spinco may also receive re-denominated Company options, and would have whatever
period to exercise such options that they are afforded in their option
agreements or as determined in accordance with the applicable plan or by the
Board of Directors. The maximum number of shares issuable under the applicable
plan will be increased by the additional number of shares covered by options
outstanding under such plan as a result of the adjustment.
