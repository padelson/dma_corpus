THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of October 22, 2016, by and between Community Bank System, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Community_ "), and Merchants Bancshares, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Merchants_ ").

  

Recitals

  

WHEREAS, Community is a bank holding company, the principal banking Subsidiary
of which is Community Bank, N.A., a national banking association (" _Community
Bank_ ");

  

WHEREAS, Merchants is a bank holding company, the principal banking Subsidiary
of which is Merchants Bank, a Vermont-based commercial bank (" _Merchants
Bank_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Community and Merchants have approved this
Agreement and the transactions described herein in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and have declared
the same advisable and in the best interests of Community and Merchants,
respectively, and their respective stockholders;

  

WHEREAS, this Agreement provides for the acquisition of Merchants by Community
pursuant to the merger of Merchants with and into Community (the " _Merger_
"). Following the consummation of the Merger, Merchants Bank shall merge (the
" _Bank Merger_ ") with and into Community Bank, with Community Bank
continuing as the surviving bank, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger between Community Bank and Merchants Bank attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ");

  

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Community\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the individuals listed on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto who
holds shares of Merchants Common Stock has executed and delivered to Community
an agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (each a
" _Stockholder Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which they have agreed,
among other things, subject to the terms of such Stockholder Support
Agreement, to vote the shares of Merchants Common Stock held of record by such
Persons or as to which they otherwise have beneficial ownership to adopt this
Agreement.

  

    

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties
agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE 1 
  
 TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER

  

Section 1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section
1.4_ herein), Merchants shall be merged with and into Community. Community
shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") resulting
from the Merger and the separate corporate existence of Merchants shall
thereupon cease. Community shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Community with all
of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger.

  

Section 1.2 _Bank Merger_. Prior to the Effective Time, Community and
Merchants shall cause Community Bank and Merchants Bank, respectively, to
execute the Bank Merger Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, Merchants Bank shall be merged with
and into Community Bank in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Section
215a-1 and with the effect provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 215a-1. Community
Bank shall be the surviving bank resulting from the Bank Merger and the
separate existence of Merchants Bank shall thereupon cease. Community Bank
shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the United States, and the
separate existence of Community Bank with all of its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Bank
Merger. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing set forth in
the Bank Merger Agreement, the Bank Merger shall occur immediately following
the Merger unless otherwise determined by Community in its sole discretion.

  

Section 1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP, 200
Liberty Street, New York, New York 10281, on a date which shall be no later
than three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article
5_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof),
unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Community and
Merchants (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

  

Section 1.4 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective as of the date and time that the Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such
later time as is agreed upon by Community and Merchants and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time when the Merger becomes effective,
the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

  

 

2  

  

  

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of Surviving Corporation; Directors and
Officers_. (a) The Organizational Documents of Community in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time until otherwise amended or
repealed.

  

(b) The directors of Community immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that effective immediately after the Effective Time,
Community shall expand the size of its Board of Directors, and shall cause
Community Bank to expand the size of its Board of Directors, by two (2) seats
and appoint two (2) directors of Merchants who would each qualify as an
"Independent Outside Director" of Community under ISS Guidelines and who meet
all legal and regulatory requirements for serving on the Board of Directors of
Community Bank, in each case as mutually agreed upon by Community and
Merchants (the " _Merchants Director Designees_ ") to serve on the Board of
Directors of each of the Surviving Corporation and Community Bank. The
Merchants Director Designees shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of
the Surviving Corporation such that (x) one (1) Merchants Director Designee is
appointed to the class of directors of the Surviving Corporation with terms
expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders occurring after the
Effective Time and (y) one (1) Merchants Director Designee is appointed to the
class of directors of the Surviving Corporation with terms expiring at the
third annual meeting of stockholders occurring after the Effective Time. The
officers of Community immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.

  

Section 1.6 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  

Section 1.7 _Structure Change_. Community may at any time change the method of
effecting the Merger and the Bank Merger (including by providing for the
merger of Merchants with a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Community) if and to the
extent requested by Community, and Merchants agrees to enter into such
amendments to this Agreement as Community may reasonably request in order to
give effect to such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
change or amendment shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (b) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the Merger with respect to Merchants\' stockholders or prevent
the rendering of the opinions contemplated in _Sections 5.2(d)_ and _5.3(d)_ ,
(c) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially
delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented
or materially delayed or (d) require submission to or approval of the
Merchants stockholders after the plan of merger set forth herein has been
adopted by the Merchants stockholders.

ARTICLE 2 
  
 TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

  

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Common Stock_. (a) _Treatment of Merchants Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of Merchants or of
Community, subject to _Section 2.1(c)_ and any applicable withholding Tax,
each share of Merchants Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Merchants Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, Merchants Restricted Shares and other than
any Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the
right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof in accordance with,
and subject to, the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in this
_Article 2_ (including the proration procedures in _Section 2.2(c)_) and
subject to potential adjustment as provided in _Section 6.1(h)_ , the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in
each case without interest: (i) the combination (such election, a " _Mixed
Election_ ") of (A) $12.00 in cash (the " _Mixed Cash Consideration_ ") and
(B) 0.6741 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Community Shares (the
" _Mixed Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Mixed Cash
Consideration, the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ "); (ii) (such election, a
" _Cash Election_ ") $40.00 in cash (the " _Cash Election Consideration_ ");
or (iii) (such election, a " _Stock Election_ ") 0.9630 validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable Community Shares (such number of Community Shares, the
" _Stock Election Consideration_ "), without interest. From and after the
Effective Time, all such Merchants Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Merchants Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Merchants Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ or
_Section 2.3(b)_ or in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , as applicable,
including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.7_, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Community Common Stock, if any, into which such Merchants
Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Merchants Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all
Merchants Shares owned by any of the Parties or by any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than any such shares owned in a fiduciary capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(c) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Merchants Common Stock or Community Common Stock, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares
of Merchants Common Stock or Community Common Stock outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  

(d) _Community Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Community Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time

  

  

 

4  

  

  

shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Community Common Stock and
shall not be affected by the Merger.

  

Section 2.2 _Election and Proration Procedures_. (a) An election form in such
form as Community shall reasonably specify and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to Merchants (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed on a date to
be mutually agreed by the Parties that is not more than forty-five (45) days
nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on
such other date as the Parties shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ")
to each holder of record of Merchants Common Stock as of the close of business
on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election
Form Record Date_ ").

  

(b) Community shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Merchants Common Stock between the Election Form
Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the
Election Deadline, and Merchants shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

  

(c) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(x) the number of shares of such holder\'s Merchants Common Stock with respect
to which such holder makes a Mixed Election (each such share, a " _Mixed
Election Share_ "), (y) the number of shares of such holder\'s Merchants
Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election (each
such share, a " _Cash Election Share_ "), and (z) the number of shares of such
holder\'s Merchants Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a
Stock Election (each such share, a " _Stock Election Share_ "). Any Merchants
Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form (including duly executed transmittal
materials included with the Election Form), accompanied by any Merchants
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which such Election Form relates, or by
an appropriate customary guaranty of delivery of the related Merchants
Certificates from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States, on or before 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the Mailing Date (or
such other time and date as the Parties shall agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ ") (other than Merchants Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ , Merchants Restricted Shares and Proposed Dissenting Shares)
shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_ ," and the holders of such No
Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to
such No Election Shares. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election
Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five
(5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline. Not later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not
yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Effective Time as is reasonably
practicable, Community shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the following
prorations to the Merger Consideration:

  

    

(i)

  |  

If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election
Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (A) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

 

5  

  

  

    

  |  

fraction, (1) the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election
Amount and (2) the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount
(such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "), and (B) a number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable Community Shares equal to the product of the
Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction equal to one (1) minus
the Cash Fraction.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election
Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration, be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount
of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares, and (B) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Community Shares equal
to the product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration minus (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election
Consideration.

   
---|--- 
  

  

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form (including
duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form),
accompanied by any Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which such
Election Form relates, or by an appropriate customary guaranty of delivery of
the related Merchants Certificates from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States, by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed
by the authorized Person properly submitting such Election Form, by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares
of Merchants Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such shares of Merchants Common Stock prior to
the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Community, Merchants, or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

  

Section 2.3 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Merchants Certificates_.

  

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Community shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Merchants to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for Merchants\' stockholders (other
than with respect to Merchants Restricted Shares) for the purpose of receiving
and holding their Election Forms and Merchants Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby. At or prior to the Closing, Community shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Community Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate Community Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration

  

  

 

6  

  

  

(excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of
the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends
under _Section 2.3(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Community Common
Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Merchants Common Stock. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under
_Section 2.3(f)_, Community shall promptly deposit additional funds with the
Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Community shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Community
Common Stock (other than with respect to Merchants Restricted Shares) in

compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Merchants

(A) the Merchants Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the

to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Merchants Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Merchants Restricted Shares) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(12) months after the Effective Time, Community shall be entitled to require

with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange
Agent\'s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Merchants
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Community (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general

Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Merchants Certificates_. In the event that any

record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Community Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to

Section 2.4 _Dissenters\' Rights_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Merchants Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who did not vote in

_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ , but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Merchants Shares in
accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the
right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent
afforded by the Appraisal Rights); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such

  

  

 

9  

  

  

holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Mixed
Election Consideration. " _Proposed Dissenting Shares_ " means shares of
Merchants Common Stock whose holders provide demands for appraisal to
Merchants prior to the Merchants Stockholder Meeting and do not vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights.

Merchants for appraisal of any Merchants Shares, of any withdrawals of such
demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by Merchants relating to Appraisal Rights, and Community shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Merchants shall not,
without the prior written consent of Community, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand,

vested or exercisable, shall, automatically and without any action on behalf
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into a right of the former
holder of such Merchants Stock Option to receive the applicable Merchants
Stock Option Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Merchants
Stock Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to a Merchants Stock Option,
an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the number of

forfeiture restrictions and granted under any Merchants Benefit Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Merchants Restricted
Share_ "), whether or not then vested, shall, automatically and without any
action on behalf of the holder thereof, vest in full and the restrictions
thereon shall lapse, and such Merchants Restricted Share shall be cancelled
and converted into a right of the former holder of such Merchants Restricted
Share to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration Value plus all dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid as
of the Effective Time with respect to such Merchants Restricted Share.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Merchants or its Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, as applicable, shall pass resolutions and take any actions
as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.5_.

compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid
at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable plan that
will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  

Section 2.6 _Withholding_. Community shall be entitled to deduct and withhold,
or cause the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable
to a holder of Merchants Common Stock, Merchants Stock Options or Merchants
Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or
any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Merchants
Common Stock, Merchants Stock Options or Merchants Restricted Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Community Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Community. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Merchants Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Community Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a share of Community Common Stock multiplied by the Average Trading Price
(rounded to the nearest whole cent).

  

Section 2.8 _Warrants_. (a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
Organizers\' Warrant shall become and be converted into a warrant to acquire,
upon the payment of the Adjusted Organizers\' Warrant Exercise Price on or

shall not be affected by the Merger), that number of shares of Community
Common Stock determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Merchants
Common Stock which may be acquired upon exercise of such Organizers\' Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Stock Election
Consideration (the " _Adjusted Organizers\' Warrant Share Number_ "), and each
holder of an Organizers\' Warrant shall, upon surrender of the certificate for
such Organizers\' Warrant to Community, receive in exchange therefor a new
Warrant certificate issued by Community and reflecting the Adjusted
Organizers\' Warrant Share Number and the Adjusted Organizers\' Warrant
Exercise Price for such Organizers\' Warrant and containing all other terms as
in the certificate for the Organizers\' Warrant so surrendered, with
appropriate provision being made with respect to the rights and interests of
such holder in accordance with the terms of the applicable Organizers\'
Warrant (a " _Replacement Organizers\' Warrant Certificate_ "). For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Adjusted Organizers\' Warrant Exercise Price_ "
means the adjusted per share exercise price of

  

  

 

11  

  

  

the Organizers\' Warrant determined by dividing the per share exercise price
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Election Consideration.

be converted into the right to receive, upon election of the holder thereof,
(i) the 2013 Warrant Cash Payment; or (ii) a Replacement 2013 Warrant

(ii)

  |  

" _Adjusted 2013 Warrant Share Number_ " means, with respect to a 2013

---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

" _2013 Warrant Cash Payment_ " means, with respect to a 2013 Warrant, a cash
payment in cancellation of such 2013 Warrant equal to (x) the number of shares
of Merchants Common Stock which may be acquired upon the exercise of such 2013
Warrant multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Cash Election
Consideration over the per share 2013 Warrant exercise price immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

(iv)

  |

Number, at a price per share equal to the Adjusted 2013 Warrant Exercise
Price, and containing all other terms as in the certificate for the 2013
Warrant so surrendered, with appropriate provision being made with respect to
the rights and interests of the holder thereof in accordance with the terms of
the 2013 Warrant.

communications to the holders of Merchants Warrants, and in taking all

give notice of a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Merchants Stockholder
Meeting_ ") to be held as

  

  

 

48  

  

  

soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Merchants Stockholder
Approval and, if so desired and mutually agreed (or otherwise required by

special meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement, and Merchants

Merchants Stockholder Approval, including by communicating to its stockholders
the Merchants Directors\' Recommendation (and including such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement), and Merchants shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to Community to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders relating to the Merchants Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to receipt of the Merchants Stockholder Approval and
subject to _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ , if the Board of Directors of Merchants,
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that,
because of (x) the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (y) the occurrence of an Intervening Event, failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Merchants may (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Merchants may communicate the basis for its Adverse
Recommendation Change to Merchants\' stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an

breach by Merchants of its obligations under _Section 4.12(a)_ , cause
Merchants to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(i)_ and
authorize Merchants to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that no such termination
shall be effective unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination
Merchants pays or causes to be paid to Community the Termination Fee and
otherwise complies with Section 6.1(i) and Section 6.2(c)); _provided_
_further_ , that the Board of Directors of Merchants (including any committee
thereof) may not take any actions under the foregoing proviso unless (i) it
gives Community at least four (4) Business Days\' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonably detailed description of the
Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the
latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in
any such Acquisition Proposal (including an unredacted copy of all proposed
agreements and other documents with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) or
any amendment or modification thereof) and (ii) at the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of Merchants takes into account in good faith
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Community and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law to fail to take such action. During the four (4) Business Day notice
period referred to in clause (i) above, Merchants shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Community in good faith (to
the extent Community seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Community. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or material development with
respect to any Intervening Event will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal or Intervening Event, as the case may be, for purposes of this
_Section 4.5(a)_ and will require a new

  

 

49  

  

  

notice period as referred to in this _Section 4.5(a)_, except that any
reference to four (4) Business Days shall instead be three (3) Business Days.

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law, Merchants shall adjourn or postpone the
Merchants Stockholder Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is

Merchants has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Merchants Stockholder Approval, and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merchants shall continue to use all
reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to solicit proxies
from Merchants stockholders in favor of the Merchants Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Merchants Stockholder
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Merchants at the Merchants Stockholder Meeting, for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Merchants of such obligation.

shares of Community Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

advisable under applicable Laws to permit consummation of the Merger as
promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with and
furnish information to the other Party to that end, and obtain all consents

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and _provided_ _further_
, that nothing contained herein shall preclude any Party from exercising its
rights under this Agreement.

may direct), the Parties shall take all actions necessary to consummate the
Bank Merger.

of restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection with the

Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Community shall also use its reasonable

exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The Parties agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits, Consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Community and Merchants shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication, whether in
writing or oral, from any Governmental Authority whose Consent is required for

Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
Consent will be materially delayed.

mean all regulatory authorizations, Consents, Orders or approvals from, to or

the failure of which to be obtained or made would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Merchants or Community, as the case may be.

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall require Community or its Subsidiaries to take, or agree
to take, any actions, or to accept any restriction, requirement or condition,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Community, Merchants and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prohibit or materially limit the ownership
or operation by Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries, or Community or any of
its Subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets of
Merchants and its Subsidiaries or Community and its Subsidiaries, in each case
taken as a whole, or compel Community or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of
or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of
Merchants and its Subsidiaries or Community and its Subsidiaries, in each case
taken as a whole (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  

Section 4.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party will give prompt
written notice to the other (and subsequently keep such other Party informed
on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of
any fact, event, change, circumstance or effect that (a) is reasonably likely
to result in any Material Adverse Effect on it, or (b) would

  

  

 

52  

  

  

cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements contained herein; _provided_ , that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall
not be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ , or _Section 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as the case may be, to
be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by such Party
due to its failure to give such notice unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ , or _Section 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as the case may be, or
give rise to a termination right under _Section 6.1_.

  

Section 4.10 _Investigation and Confidentiality_. (a) Upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable Laws, Merchants shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors and other Representatives of Community, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of their
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology
systems and records, and, during such period, Merchants shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, make available to Community such information concerning
their respective businesses, properties and personnel as Community may
reasonably request. Community shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any interference with Merchants\' regular business operations during
any such access. Neither Merchants nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Merchants (after
giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No
investigation by Community shall affect the representations and warranties of
Merchants or the right of Community to rely thereon.

  

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and
Representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential
information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its
Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations and financial positions to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(c) Merchants shall provide Community, no later than fifteen (15) days after
the end of each month, an updated list of each of its Delinquent Loans.

  

Section 4.11 _Press Releases; Publicity_. Prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall consult with and obtain the approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other as to the form and substance of
any press release, other public statement or stockholder communication related
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby prior to issuing
such press release, public statement or stockholder communication or making
any other public or stockholder disclosure related thereto; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 4.11_ shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from
making any disclosure that its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order
to satisfy such Party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by Law, NASDAQ or the
NYSE; and _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchants
shall not be required to consult with Community before issuing any press
release, other public statement or stockholder communication with respect to
an Adverse

and will cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries\' respective directors,
officers, employees and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) continue, engage or participate in any
negotiations concerning, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
Person (other than Persons who are Affiliates or Representatives of Merchants
or Community) relating to, or (iv) except as expressly permitted by _Section
4.5(a)_ , approve, recommend, agree to or accept, any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _that_ , prior to, but not after, the time the Merchants
Stockholder Approval is obtained, if Merchants receives an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that was not
received in violation of clauses (i) - (iv) above, and Merchants\' Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, Merchants may, and
may permit its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to, furnish
or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data to and participate in
such negotiations or discussions with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal to the extent that the Board of Directors of Merchants concludes in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ _further_ , that prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Merchants shall
have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and shall provide to
Community any such information not previously provided to Community.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Merchants and its Representatives may (without any determination by the Board
of Directors of Merchants or consultation with outside counsel or its
financial advisor) (x) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time
the Merchants Stockholder Approval is obtained that was not received in
violation of clauses (i) - (iv) above, contact such third party solely in
order to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and/or (y) direct any
Person who makes an Acquisition Proposal or who expresses interest to
Merchants in making an Acquisition Proposal to this Agreement, including the
provisions of this _Section 4.12_. Merchants will immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before
the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than Community with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Merchants shall use its reasonable best efforts,
subject to applicable Law, to, within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential
information provided to any Person (other than Community and its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives) pursuant to any existing confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) Merchants shall promptly, and in any event within twenty four (24) hours
of receipt, advise Community in writing in the event Merchants or any of its
directors, employees, officers or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition
Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for information,

  

  

 

54  

  

  

discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer,
and shall furnish Community with a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or,
where such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, with a description of the
material terms and conditions thereof). Merchants shall keep Community
informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of
the status and details (including, within twenty four (24) hours after the
occurrence of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or
offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence
and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Merchants shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours) notify Community
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

  

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of Merchants nor any committee thereof
shall, except as expressly permitted by _Section 4.5(a)_ , (i) (A) withdraw
(or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Community) the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of
Merchants or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend, endorse or otherwise
declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, (C) resolve, agree
or propose to take any such actions or (D) submit this Agreement to its
stockholders without recommendation (each such action set forth in this clause
(i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or
(ii) (A) cause or permit Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract constituting or relating
to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with _Section 4.12(a)_ ) or (B) resolve, agree or propose to take
any such actions.

  

(d) Merchants agrees that any breach by its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates or Representatives of this _Section 4.12_ shall be deemed a breach
by Merchants.

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Merchants or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, a "stop, look and listen" communication shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of Merchants publicly
states that the Merchants Directors\' Recommendation has not changed or refers
stockholders to the Merchants Directors\' Recommendation.

  

Section 4.13 _Takeover Laws_. None of Merchants, Community or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Law to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated

  

  

 

55  

  

  

hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Party and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Law.

  

Section 4.14 _Employee Matters_. (a) The current employees of Merchants or any
of its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of Community or its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be given, subject
to applicable Law, credit for past service with Merchants and its Subsidiaries
to the extent credited by Merchants and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of determining eligibility for and vesting of
employee benefits (but not for pension benefit accrual purposes) under all
welfare and retirement programs maintained by Community or its Subsidiaries in
which such Continuing Employees participate following the Effective Time and
for purposes of determining length of vacation, sick time, paid time off and
severance under Community\'s applicable plan or policy, except if any such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, under the
welfare plans of Community and its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees
participate, Community shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive, or cause to be waived, for each participating Continuing Employee, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent
such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Merchants or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by each participating Continuing
Employee in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

(b) In the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee shall be
terminated by Community or one of its Subsidiaries, other than for Cause,
during the Severance Period (as each term is defined in _Schedule 4.14(b)_ ),
such Continuing Employee shall be entitled (subject to meeting applicable
eligibility and vesting requirements) to receive severance benefits as set
forth in _Schedule 4.14(b)_.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Merchants shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions that may be requested by Community in
writing with respect to (i) causing one or more Merchants Benefit Plans (other
than (x) any employment agreements and severance arrangements with Continuing
Employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement to the extent such
agreements are set forth on Section 3.2(j)(i) of the Merchants Disclosure
Letter and (y) the Director Deferred Compensation Plans ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties may mutually determine to terminate such plans)
to terminate as of or following the date immediately preceding the Effective
Time or for benefit accruals and entitlements to cease as of or following the
date immediately preceding the Effective Time, (ii) causing the continuation
on and after the Effective Time of any Contract, arrangement or insurance
policy relating to any Merchants Benefit Plan for such period as may be
requested by Community, or (iii) cooperating with Community to facilitate the
merger of any Merchants Benefit Plan into any Benefit Plan of Community or its
Subsidiaries as of or following the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices,
or

  

  

 

56  

  

  

other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this _Section 4.14(c)_ shall be subject to Community\'s
reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(d) Community shall honor, each in accordance with its terms, the employment
agreements and severance arrangements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement to the extent such agreements are set forth on Section 3.2(j)(i) of
the Merchants Disclosure Letter, except to the extent that any such agreements
or arrangements are superseded or terminated as of or following the Effective
Time.

  

(e) In the event of any termination of any Merchants Benefit Plan providing
employer-provided health coverage or consolidation of any such plan with any
Benefit Plan of Community or any of its Subsidiaries providing employer-
provided health coverage within twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
(i) Community shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to
Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-provided health coverage on
the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly situated employees of
Community and its Subsidiaries and (ii) former employees of Merchants or any
of its Subsidiaries and their qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage under group health plans of Community to the extent
required by COBRA. During the twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
unless a Continuing Employee causes coverage to terminate under a Merchants
Benefit Plan providing employer-provided health coverage prior to the time
that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in any Benefit Plan
of Community or any of its Subsidiaries providing employer-provided health
coverage, neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate the
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents as of the
Effective Time under any Merchants Benefit Plan providing employer-provided
health coverage prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their
dependents become eligible to participate in a Benefit Plan of Community or
any of its Subsidiaries providing employer-provided health coverage.

  

(f) As of the Effective Time, Community shall assume the Merchants Amended and
Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, the Merchants 1996
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Merchants Salary
Continuation Plan and the Merchants and Subsidiaries Amended and Restated 2008
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Trustees (collectively, the "
_Director Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") and shall continue to honor the
terms and obligations thereunder unless the Director Deferred Compensation
Plans are terminated prior to the Effective Time by mutual agreement of the
Parties.

  

(g) The provisions of this _Section 4.14_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto, and no Service Provider or any other Person shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing
herein, expressed or implied, shall be construed as an amendment to any
Benefit Plan for any purpose or confer upon any Continuing Employee or any
other Person any right to employment or continued employment with any of the
parties hereto or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any period.
Nothing in this _Section 4.14_ shall be construed to limit the right of
Community or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time,
Merchants and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Merchants Benefit
Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by

  

  

 

57  

  

  

the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this _Section 4.14_ be
construed to require Community or any of its Subsidiaries to retain the
employment of any particular Continuing Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Effective Time.

  

Section 4.15 _Certain Policies_. Following receipt of all Requisite Regulatory
Approvals and adoption of this Agreement at the Merchants Stockholder Meeting:

  

(a) Merchants shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable Law and on a basis
mutually satisfactory to it and Community, modify and change its accounting,
investment, loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications, content and size of investment portfolio, and
levels of reserves and accruals) so as to be applied, in all material
respects, on a basis that is consistent with that of Community;

  

(b) Merchants and Community shall review the adequacy of reserves for loan
losses currently established by Merchants and, if deemed warranted by both
parties under GAAP, Merchants shall make mutually acceptable changes to such
reserves; and

  

(c) Merchants shall consult with Community with respect to determining the
amount and timing of recognizing, for financial accounting and income Tax
reporting purposes, Merchants\' expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and, subject to GAAP and applicable Law, Merchants shall recognize its costs
and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby at such
time or times as are reasonably requested by Community.

  

Section 4.16 _Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Community shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, each present and former director, officer or employee of
Merchants and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements), judgments, settlements
effected with the prior written consent of Community (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), fines, losses, taxes, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with or arising out of any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether formal or informal, and
whether arising before or after the Effective Time (regardless of whether the
Indemnified Party is as a named party or a participant other than as a named
party, including as a witness), arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection
with any action taken or not taken at the request of Merchants or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Merchants or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan) and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and Community shall also advance expenses as
incurred by such Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law within thirty (30) days after a written request setting forth
such expenses in reasonable detail; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and
customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such

  

  

 

58  

  

  

Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. The Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with Community in the Indemnified Party\'s defense
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Community shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by Merchants ( _provided_ , that
Community may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of Merchants or
any of its Subsidiaries arising from matters, acts or omissions which occurred
at or before the Effective Time (including in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided_ , that Community shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current
annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Merchants for such insurance (the
" _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then Community shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance which, in Community\'s good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, Merchants in consultation with Community, may (and at
the request of Community, Merchants shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6) year "tail" policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap. If Merchants obtains such a "tail
policy," Community shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for such six (6) year period.

  

(c) Subject to applicable Law, the obligations of Community and Merchants
under this _Section 4.16_ shall not be terminated or modified after the
Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party or
any other Person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 4.16_ without the
prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Party or affected Person (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 4.16_ ).

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.16_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification,
advancement, exculpation or contribution that any such individual may have
under the Bylaws of Merchants or its Subsidiaries, or by indemnification
agreement, resolution, contract or otherwise. If Community or any of its
successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and
not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger,
transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other
entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in each case to the extent
the obligations set forth in this _Section 4.16_ are not otherwise transferred
and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation of Law or otherwise,
Community will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Community will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 4.16_.

  

  

 

59  

  

  

Section 4.17 _Merchants Debt_. (a) Community will execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Merchants, at or prior
to the Effective Time, any supplements, amendments or other instruments

Subsidiaries to, take all such actions reasonably requested by Community or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merchants Debentures (i) to the
extent required by the terms of the Merchants Debentures or under applicable
Law to be taken prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
the giving of any notices that may be required in connection with the Merger
or the Bank Merger, and the delivery of any supplemental indentures, legal
opinions, officers\' certificates or other documents or instruments required
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the respective consummation
thereof or (ii) in order to facilitate Community\'s compliance with the
foregoing _Section 4.17(a)_.

  

Section 4.18 _Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)_. The Board of
Directors of Community and of Merchants, or a committee of nonemployee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the
Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case
of Merchants) any dispositions of or other transactions in Merchants Common
Stock by the Merchants Insiders, and (in the case of Community) any
acquisitions of Community Common Stock by any person who, immediately
following the Merger, will be officers or directors of Community subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Community, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 4.19 _Systems Integration_. From and after the date hereof, Merchants
and Merchants Bank shall and shall cause their directors, officers and
employees to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts (during normal
business hours and without undue disruption to either business) to cause
Merchants Bank\'s data processing consultants and software providers to,
cooperate and assist Community, upon Community\'s reasonable request, in
connection with an electronic and systems conversion of all applicable data of
Merchants and its Subsidiaries concerning the Loans, deposits and other assets
and Liabilities of Merchants and its Subsidiaries to the Community systems.
Merchants and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Community in connection
with the planning for the efficient and orderly combination of the parties and
the operation of Community Bank (including the former operations of Merchants
Bank) after the Bank Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such
later date as Community may decide. After the execution of this Agreement,
Merchants and Community shall each designate an individual to serve as liaison
concerning the transfer of data processing information and other similar
operational matters. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (i) neither Community nor Community Bank shall be permitted to
exercise control of Merchants or Merchants Bank prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) neither Merchants nor Merchants Bank

  

  

 

60  

  

  

shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be
deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state
antitrust Laws.

  

Section 4.20 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Community
and Merchants shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Community Common Stock and Merchants Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
Parties that holders of Merchants Common Stock shall not receive two (2)
dividends, or fail to receive one (1) dividend, in any quarter with respect to

Merchants that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the two preceding sentences, then no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this _Section 6.1(h)_ , and this

product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the

actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

for _Section 4.16_ , no consent, approval, or agreement of any third party
beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this

Party\'s obligations under this Agreement, and to waive any or all of the
conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, except any
condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law.
No waiver by a Party shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly
authorized officer of such Party.

  

  

 

79  

  

  

(b) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No
waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this
Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder

of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably

may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, (x) any claim that such Party is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of any such court, (y) any claim that such Party and such
Party\'s property is immune from any legal process issued by any such court
and (z) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 7.8_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

  

Section 7.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of
copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or electronic
transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement

attorneys and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary
meaning of the words used so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and
intentions of the Parties.

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such
provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been
held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and
equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the Parties.
If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

Section 7.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A
NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING

accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, except as

with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement). The

  

  

 

82  

  

  

Parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 7.15_ , a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 7.15_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section
7.15_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
Party\'s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 7.15_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article 6_ (and pursuing damages after such termination (subject

---|--- 
  

  

    

(v)

  |  

 _Ownership of Shares_. Except for restrictions in favor of Community pursuant
to this Agreement and restrictions in favor of Merchants with respect to any

general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act, and the

applicable, free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, adverse claim,
pledge, security interest, voting trust or agreement, understanding or
arrangement, or other encumbrance or lien and has sole voting power and sole
power of disposition with respect to the Stockholder\'s Shares with no
restrictions on the Stockholder\'s rights of voting or disposition pertaining
thereto and no Person other than the Stockholder has any right to direct or
approve the voting or disposition of any of the Stockholder\'s Owned Shares.
As of the date hereof, the number of Owned Shares equals the number of Shares

Merchants Restricted Shares owned by the Stockholder as set forth on the

investigation, complaint or other proceeding pending against the Stockholder
or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the Stockholder
that restricts or prohibits (or, if successful, would restrict or prohibit)
the performance by the Stockholder of his or her obligations under this
Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(vii)

  |  

 _Reliance_. The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Community is

(b) _Covenants_. From the date hereof until the Expiration Time:

  

    

(i)

  |  

the Stockholder agrees not to take any action that would make any
representation or warranty of the Stockholder contained herein untrue or
incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing, impeding,

(c) _Amendments, Waivers, Etc._ This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or terminated except by an
instrument in writing signed by Community and the Stockholder.

  

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. No party may assign any of its, his or her
rights or delegate any of its, his or her obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except Community may,
without the consent of the Stockholder, assign any of its rights and delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Community.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns, including without limitation any corporate
successor by merger or otherwise. Notwithstanding any Transfer of Merchants
Common Stock consistent with this Agreement, the transferor shall remain
liable for the performance of all obligations of such transferor under this
Agreement.

  

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person, other than the parties to this
Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement except for such rights as
may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under _Section 6(d)_.

  

    

  

  

(f) _No Partnership, Agency, or Joint Venture_. This Agreement is intended to
create, and creates, a contractual relationship and is not intended to create,
and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint venture or any like
relationship between the parties hereto.

  

(g) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject
matter.

  

(h) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

(i) _Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative_. The parties hereto
acknowledge that money damages are not an adequate remedy for violations of
this Agreement and that any party, in addition to any other rights and
remedies which the parties may have hereunder or at law or in equity, may, in
his, her or its sole discretion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
for specific performance or injunction or such other relief as such court may
deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any
violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party
waives any objection to the imposition of such relief. All rights, powers and
remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such rights, powers
or remedies by such party.

  

(j) _No Waiver_. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power
or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party
hereto with his, her or its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice
of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a
waiver by such party of his, her or its right to exercise any such right,
power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

  

(k) _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  

    

(i)

  |  

This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles that would result
in the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

    

  

  

    

  |  

of Delaware or, if under applicable Law, exclusive jurisdiction over such
matters is vested in the Federal courts, any Federal court located in the
State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Court of Chancery or, to the extent required by Law, in
such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, (x) any claim that such party
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, (y) any claim
that such party and such party\'s property is immune from any legal process
issued by any such court and (z) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each of the
parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 6(b). Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

(l) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT,
COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A
NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
CANNOT BE WAIVED.

  

(m) _Drafting and Representation_. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted for or against any party because that party or his, her or
its legal representative drafted the provision.

  

(n) _Name, Captions, Gender_. Section headings of this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and are to be given no effect in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used herein shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or
neuter forms.

  

(o) _Capacity_. This Agreement shall only apply to actions taken by the
Stockholder in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Merchants and, if
applicable, shall not in

  

    

  

  

any way limit or affect actions the Stockholder or any of his or her
Representatives may take in such Person\'s capacity as a director, officer, or
employee of Merchants, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement or be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the Stockholder from
exercising the Stockholder\'s fiduciary duties as a director or officer of
Merchants.

  

(p) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF and in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart
may consist of a number of copies each signed by less than all, but together
signed by all, the parties hereto.

  

(q) _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have
the meanings specified in the Merger Agreement.

  

(r) _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (i) the Merger
Agreement is validly approved by Merchants\' Board of Directors, (ii) the
Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto, and (iii) this Agreement
is executed by all parties hereto.
