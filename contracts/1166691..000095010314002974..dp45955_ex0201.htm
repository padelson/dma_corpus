Transaction Steps

  |  

Subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions described below, at
Closing and in the following sequence, as promptly as practicable following
the Comcast-TWC Transaction:

  

  

* Comcast will form a new entity ("SpinCo") holding the assets and liabilities to be included in the spin-off transaction and described under "SpinCo Assets and Liabilities" below (the "Contribution");

  

  

* The parties will use reasonable best efforts to arrange, and SpinCo will use reasonable best efforts to incur, new indebtedness ("SpinCo Indebtedness") in an amount equal to 5.00 times the 2014 EBITDA of the SpinCo Systems (as such term is defined by SpinCo's financing sources for purposes of the financing), as described in more detail in Schedule 1, of which indebtedness:

  

  

o to the extent there is basis in excess of the estimated amount of expenses
to be reimbursed by SpinCo to Comcast as described on Schedule 1, an amount
equal to such excess will be placed with third parties and such proceeds
distributed (or, at Comcast's election, an amount of cash in excess of such
excess basis) to Comcast (the "Cash Dividend"), provided that the amount of
the Cash Dividend shall be determined by Comcast in good faith with a view
towards maximizing the Cash Dividend and minimizing any taxes to Comcast as a
result of any potential payment relating back to the Spin-Off for federal
income tax purposes; and

  

  

o the remainder of such indebtedness will be placed with Comcast, which will
then effect a bank-intermediated debt-for-debt exchange (the "Debt-for-Debt
Exchange");

   
   |   
   |  

* Comcast will distribute all of SpinCo's shares to the holders of outstanding shares of Comcast common stock (pro forma for the Comcast acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC") (the "Comcast-TWC Transaction") (the "Spin-Off");

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

o At Comcast's election, the separation will be accomplished through an
exchange offer by Comcast to exchange stock of SpinCo for outstanding shares
of Comcast common stock, provided that in no event shall such election result
in a reduction in the number of SpinCo shares received by New Charter in the
Merger.

  

  

* A newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of CCH I, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter (CCH I, LLC being referred to herein as "New Charter"), will merge with and into Charter with the effect that all shares of Charter shall become shares of New Charter (the "Charter Reorganization"). Immediately prior to the Charter Reorganization, New Charter shall convert into a corporation;

  

  

* Another newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of New Charter ("Merger Sub") will merge with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo surviving (the "Merger").

  

  

o In the Merger, New Charter shall receive a number of SpinCo shares in an
amount equal to the maximum percentage of SpinCo shares as may be received
without causing the shareholders of Comcast immediately prior to consummation
of the Comcast-TWC Transaction (the "Historic Comcast Shareholders") to own
less (within the meaning of Section 355(e)) on a direct basis than the Comcast
Shareholder Percentage (such percentage, the "SpinCo Percentage"), provided,
however, that, at Charter's election and with Comcast's consent (such election
to be considered by Comcast in good faith with a view towards ensuring the
Intended Tax Treatment of the Transactions, and taking into account any IRS
Ruling), the SpinCo Percentage shall be calculated by taking into account the
355(e) Look-Through Rule (partially or to the full extent permitted))1; and

  

  

o In the Merger, SpinCo holders shall receive New Charter shares (the "Merger
Consideration") in the aggregate equal in value to the product of (x) the sum
of (1) the excess of (A) 7.125 times the Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the SpinCo
Systems over (B) the amount of SpinCo Indebtedness as of Closing (excluding
the amount of SpinCo Indebtedness

1 The "355(e) Look-Through Rule" means the rules of Code Section
355(e)(3)(A)(iv) and Code Section 355(e)(4)(C), and "IRS Ruling" means a
private letter ruling delivered by the IRS in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Comcast. The 355(e) Look-Through Rule, if applied, shall be
applied in the manner agreed by the parties or pursuant to the IRS Ruling, as
applicable. For illustrative purposes only, were the Transactions effected as
of the date hereof using the outstanding shares of Comcast as of 3/31/14 and
TWC as of 2/10/14, it is estimated that the SpinCo Percentage would be
approximately 33% (not giving effect to the 355(e) Look-Through Rule).

incurred to pay expenses and reimbursements, in each case in cash or in SpinCo
securities ), (2) the amount of SpinCo Financing Expenses incurred by Comcast
and not reimbursed by SpinCo and (3) the fair market value of the SpinCo Non-
System Assets times (y) the percentage of SpinCo's outstanding shares owned by
New Charter immediately after the Merger, such New Charter shares to be valued
based on the 60-calendar-day VWAP of Charter shares ending on the last trading
day prior to Closing (the "Charter Share Valuation");

  

  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Historic Comcast
Shareholders shall, following the Merger, own no less than a 50.75% interest,
within the meaning of Section 355(e), in SpinCo (at Charter's election, and
with Comcast's consent (such election to be considered by Comcast in good
faith with a view towards ensuring the Intended Tax Treatment of the
Transactions, and taking into account any IRS Ruling), taking into account,
partially or to the full extent permitted, the 355(e) Look-Through Rule) (the
"Comcast Shareholder Percentage") (and, for the avoidance of doubt, all
shareholders of Comcast immediately prior to the Merger, including
shareholders who were shareholders of TWC immediately prior to consummation of
the Comcast-TWC Transaction, shall be treated pro rata in the Merger). The
parties agree to work in good faith to determine the appropriate methodology
for calculating the SpinCo Percentage and Comcast Shareholder Percentage.

  

  

SpinCo shall not issue any options or other rights to purchase equity,
securities or other instruments convertible into equity (to employees of
SpinCo or otherwise), until after such time as the Merger Consideration has
been calculated and paid;

  

  

* Charter shall exchange with Comcast the assets and liabilities described under "Swap Assets and Liabilities" below in a tax-free like-kind exchange (the "Swap"); and

  

  

* Charter shall acquire the assets and liabilities described under "Taxable Purchase Assets and Liabilities" below in a taxable asset purchase (the "Taxable Purchase," and, with the Contribution, the Cash Dividend, the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the Spin-Off, the Merger, the Charter Reorganization and the Swap, collectively the "Transactions").

   
---|--- 
  

SpinCo Assets and Liabilities

  |  

Comcast shall transfer to SpinCo the following assets (collectively, the
"SpinCo Assets"):

  

  

* the systems currently owned by Comcast in the DMAs or sections of DMAs set forth under the 'Comcast' heading on Schedule 2 

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(the "SpinCo Footprint") and their actual subscribers, and all other assets
(including employees) primarily related thereto (the "SpinCo Systems"), and

  

  

* all other investments and businesses of Comcast related primarily to the cable system operations in the SpinCo Footprint (the "SpinCo Non-System Assets"), provided that any local news networks related primarily to the cable systems operations in the SpinCo Footprint shall be deemed part of the SpinCo Systems and not the SpinCo Non-System Assets.

  

  

Immediately after Closing, SpinCo will have only the following liabilities
(collectively, the "SpinCo Liabilities"):

  

  

* all liabilities (other than any pre-Spin-Off income, income-based franchise or similar income-based tax liabilities) primarily related to the SpinCo Assets or to cable systems operations in the SpinCo Footprint, which for the avoidance of doubt:

  

  

(i) will include without limitation the portion of payroll, pension, and other
compensation and benefits liabilities to the extent related to the current and
former employees of the businesses included in the SpinCo Assets,

  

  

(ii) will not include any liabilities arising from any litigation against
defendants that include any person or entity that is not included in the
SpinCo Assets that is pending as of the closing that is related to both the
SpinCo Assets and the Retained Assets (e.g., a claim against Comcast
involving, in whole or in part, both SpinCo Assets and Retained Assets will be
retained by Comcast and will not be a SpinCo Liability),

  

  

(iii) will not include any liabilities of any entities wholly owned, directly
or indirectly, by Comcast, TWC or their respective affiliates, in those
instances in which those entities are included in the SpinCo Assets, other
than to the extent that such liabilities would have been SpinCo Liabilities if
held directly by Comcast, and

  

  

(iv) for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the SpinCo Indebtedness, any
liabilities of SpinCo whose incurrence is expressly contemplated by this
Agreement and ordinary and typical liabilities incurred by SpinCo in
connection with the organization and establishment of a publicly listed
company (e.g., the obligation to pay franchise taxes, obligations as an
Exchange Act filer and a listed company, new employee benefit obligations,
etc.).

  

  

It is understood and agreed that any assets associated with any

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

SpinCo Liabilities will constitute SpinCo Assets to the extent related to such
liabilities (e.g., in the case of pension liabilities included in the SpinCo
Liabilities, pre-funded pension accounts will constitute SpinCo Assets to the
extent related to such liabilities).

  

  

Comcast will retain all other assets and liabilities (the "Retained Assets"
and "Retained Liabilities", respectively).

  

  

At all times prior to Closing, Comcast shall cause SpinCo to operate in the
ordinary course in all material respects and to maintain a normalized working
capital amount (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that SpinCo
working capital shall exclude cash and cash equivalents).

  

  

In the event Closing occurs before audited SpinCo financial statements for
fiscal year 2014 are made available to Charter, there shall be a true up of
the Merger Consideration following Closing between Comcast and SpinCo (which
true-up shall be based solely on the difference between estimated and actual
Carveout 2014 EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to the provisions of "Terms Used
in This Agreement") of the SpinCo Systems and shall otherwise be calculated
using the same inputs as described above). The true up shall be subject to the
dispute resolution procedures described under "Dispute Resolution Procedures"
below. In the event of any true up payment from SpinCo to Comcast or from
Comcast to SpinCo, SpinCo or Comcast (as applicable) shall make such payment
to the other person as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than
six months following final resolution of the amount of such payment, provided
that interest shall accrue on any such payment at a rate of 5% per annum
starting 10 business days after final resolution of the amount of such
payment.

Tax Sharing

  |  

SpinCo, Comcast and, solely for the purpose of its covenant and
indemnification obligation in respect of the New Charter Tax Standstill
pursuant to clause (i) below, New Charter shall enter into a customary tax
sharing agreement, which shall provide that Comcast shall indemnify SpinCo for
pre-closing income taxes of SpinCo and Comcast (including for the avoidance of
doubt, any Spin-Off Taxes of Comcast for which Comcast is not indemnified
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) below), that New Charter and SpinCo shall
indemnify Comcast for certain spin-off and other separation taxes and that
Comcast shall indemnify SpinCo for certain spin-off (or other separation)
related taxes resulting from the breach of customary representations,
covenants and agreements, as well as other customary tax allocation and
procedural matters.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the tax sharing agreement shall provide that:

  

  

i. From and until the second anniversary of Closing (or otherwise pursuant to
a "plan" within the meaning of

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

Code Section 355(e)), New Charter shall not take any action that would result
in (i) New Charter holding (or being treated as holding) SpinCo shares in
excess of the SpinCo Percentage or (ii) to the extent the 355(e) Look-Through
Rule is taken into account in determining the SpinCo Percentage, the Historic
Comcast Shareholders owning less (within the meaning of Code Section 355(e)
and taking into account the 355(e) Look-Through Rule) than the Comcast
Shareholder Percentage (in the case of clause (ii), other than any action
permitted by an IRS Ruling) (the "New Charter Tax Standstill"). In the event
that Comcast is subject to any Spin-Off Taxes due to a violation of the New
Charter Tax Standstill by New Charter, New Charter shall indemnify Comcast (on
an after-tax basis) with respect to such Spin-Off Taxes, provided that such
indemnification shall be structured in the most tax-efficient manner possible
and shall be without duplication of any amounts for which Comcast has received
indemnification from any other party.

  

  

ii. From and until the second anniversary of Closing (or otherwise pursuant to
a "plan" within the meaning of Code Section 355(e)), SpinCo shall not take any
action that would result in (i) New Charter holding (or being treated as
holding) SpinCo shares in excess of the SpinCo Percentage or (ii) to the
extent the 355(e) Look-Through Rule is taken into account in determining the
SpinCo Percentage, the Historic Comcast Shareholders owning less (within the
meaning of Code Section 355(e) and taking into account the 355(e) Look-Through
Rule) than the Comcast Shareholder Percentage (in the case of clause (ii),
other than any action permitted by an IRS Ruling) (the "SpinCo Tax
Standstill"). In the event that Comcast is subject to any Spin-Off Taxes due
to any action of any person (other than (i) any action of Comcast or its
affiliates (including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast for
this purpose), and (ii) any action of any person with respect to Comcast)
following the Spin-Off that is not described in the foregoing clause (i),
including the Merger, the actions contemplated under "SpinCo Governance" or a
violation of the SpinCo Tax Standstill by SpinCo, SpinCo shall indemnify
Comcast (on an after-tax basis) with respect to such Spin-Off Taxes without
duplication of any amounts for which Comcast has received indemnification from
any other party, provided,

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

however, that (A) if Comcast has a claim in respect of such Spin-Off Taxes
against Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty") under the Voting Agreement
between Comcast and Liberty entered into as of the date hereof and no SpinCo
action shall have contributed to such Spin-Off Taxes, Comcast shall first have
taken reasonable best efforts to pursue and exhaust any and all recourse
available to Comcast against Liberty and (B) if both a SpinCo action and the
action of another person gives rise to such Spin-Off Taxes, then Comcast shall
pursue its available recourses against SpinCo and such other person.2

  

  

iii. In the event that the Spin-Off fails to qualify as tax-free to Comcast
under Code Section 355 and/or the Debt-for-Debt Exchange fails to qualify as
tax-free to Comcast under Code Section 361 and Comcast has not been
indemnified for the Spin-Off Taxes arising from such failure, SpinCo shall pay
Comcast for the value of the Tax Benefit (as applied to the Basis Step Up in
respect of the Spin-Off) as a result of the step-up in basis as a consequence
of such failure, (x) upon filing its tax return for each of the first eight
taxable years (or portions of) ending following the closing, pursuant to the
principles of clause (A) of Annex B and (y) upon filing its tax return for the
Final Year, pursuant to the principles of clause (B) of Annex B, but using the
Projection Assumption instead of the Valuation Assumption, provided, that
SpinCo shall not intentionally take any action to delay the recognition of any
Tax Benefit, and provided further, that, only depreciation and amortization
that is allowable at such time shall be taken into account. Comcast shall make
a timely protective election under Section 336(e) with respect to the Spin-
Off.

  

  

For purposes of the tax sharing agreement: (i) "Spin-Off Taxes " means any
taxes resulting directly from the Contribution, Spin-Off and Debt-for-Debt
Exchange failing to qualify as tax-free under Code Sections 355, 361 and/or
368, in whole or in part, (ii) "Projection Assumption" means the assumption
that, in each taxable year following the Final Year, SpinCo will generate an
amount of taxable income as determined pursuant to the good faith best
estimates of SpinCo management and as certified to Comcast by the Chief
Financial Officer of SpinCo, and (iii) actions of any

   
---|--- 
 

    

  

 

1 For the avoidance of doubt, any Spin-Off and other separation related taxes
arising as a result of the application of Code Section 355(e) due to the fact
that any information provided by Comcast (e.g., related to the number of
SpinCo shares issued to historic Comcast shareholders and historic TWC
shareholders) is incorrect shall not be allocated to SpinCo but instead shall
be allocated to Comcast.

     | subsidiary of New Charter, including Charter (but for the avoidance
of doubt, excluding SpinCo), shall be considered actions of New Charter.

SpinCo Governance

  |  

Immediately prior to the Merger, the board of SpinCo shall consist of a
classified board of 6 directors, separated into 3 classes, selected as
follows:

  

* 3 independent directors selected by Comcast, each to be reasonably acceptable to Charter, each of which shall be in a separate class of directors;

  

  

* 3 independent directors selected by Comcast from a list of potential nominees provided by Charter, each of which shall be in a separate class of directors, provided that if there are not 3 candidates on such list that are reasonably acceptable to Comcast, Charter shall submit lists of additional candidates to Comcast until 3 candidates that are reasonably acceptable to Comcast have been identified to serve.

  

  

Immediately prior to the Merger, the board of Merger Sub shall consist of 3
directors selected by Charter, who are currently expected to be officers
and/or directors of Charter.

  

  

Pursuant to the Merger, the board of SpinCo shall be increased by 3 persons
(to be 9 directors total), and the 3 directors of Merger Sub shall be added to
the board of SpinCo, in order to fill such vacancies. Immediately following
the Merger, each separate class of directors shall initially be comprised of
one Merger Sub director, one director selected pursuant to the first bullet
point above and one director selected pursuant to the second bullet point
above.

  

  

Furthermore, pursuant to the Merger, the officers of Merger Sub (selected by
Charter after consultation with Comcast), each of whom shall be appropriately
qualified for the applicable position and shall reasonably meet any applicable
requirements set forth on the Governance, Management and Services Framework
set forth on Annex A, shall become the officers of SpinCo immediately
following the Merger and shall have customary indemnification agreements from
SpinCo, provided that, as of immediately following the Merger, such officers
shall be employees at will and, for the avoidance of doubt, may be terminated
by the board of SpinCo at any time, with or without cause.

  

  

Following the Merger, each committee of the board of SpinCo (other than any
committee of independent directors required by applicable law or stock
exchange rules) shall be comprised of 3 directors, who shall all be from the
same class of directors, unless a majority of the independent directors on the
SpinCo board determine (based on the advice of counsel)

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | that a committee comprised of 3 directors from the same class of
directors would be inappropriate as a result of a conflict of interest. Except
for customary matters to be acted on by any committee that is otherwise
comprised as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, any committee
that is not comprised of 3 directors of the same class may operate only in an
advisory capacity to the Board; provided that any committee that is not so
comprised as a result of a conflict of interest will be permitted to retain
advisors.   

  

In addition, immediately following the Merger, SpinCo and Charter shall enter
into a services agreement (the "Services Agreement") pursuant to which Charter
shall provide those services to SpinCo set forth in Appendix A to the
Governance, Management and Services Framework set forth on Annex A, such
services to be provided at actual, economic cost (with such economic cost
reflecting (x) in the case of operational services such as a call center or
network operation center ("Operational Services") (excluding services provided
via the inclusion of SpinCo under a third party contract), allocation of
overheads directly related to providing such services, but not including
overheads relating to employees at the Senior Vice President level or above
and (y) in the case of Operational Services provided from a common location to
both Charter and SpinCo, an appropriate proportional allocation basis (e.g.,
number of subscribers or work orders)), and in all cases without any markup
(the "Shared Services Cost"). In addition, Charter shall receive a quarterly
payment equal to 4.25% of SpinCo quarterly gross revenues to be paid to
Charter in arrears (the "Services Fee"). The Services Agreement shall have an
initial term of three years. The Services Agreement shall automatically renew
for additional one-year terms, unless either party gives notice of non-renewal
at least one year prior to the end of the three-year initial term (or one year
prior to the end of any renewal term). The Services Agreement shall also be
terminable by either party for customary cause events.

  

  

Following Closing, SpinCo shall keep employees and operations intact as
necessary to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment of the Transactions. In
those markets in which SpinCo has a larger field operations presence than
Charter, if agreed by SpinCo and Charter, SpinCo may also provide services to
Charter at the Shared Services Cost (as calculated for SpinCo). Subject to the
requirements regarding approval of affiliate transactions set forth under
"Future SpinCo Transactions," SpinCo may modify such cost methodology mutually
and reciprocally with Charter.

  

  

All shares of SpinCo shall be of a single class carrying one vote per share.

   
---|--- 
  

SpinCo Organizational Documents

  |  

The organizational and other governance documents of SpinCo that will be in
effect immediately following the Merger shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Charter, and such documents shall (x) provide that

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | SpinCo's certificate of incorporation may not be amended without
the affirmative vote of 60% of SpinCo's shareholders (or, with respect to the
Tax Standstill Governance Provisions, as set forth below), (y) as applicable,
contain terms consistent with the provisions hereof (e.g., classification and
size of SpinCo board and composition of committees), and (z) provide that
SpinCo shall not take any action during the duration of the Tax Standstill
that would cause the Historic Comcast Shareholders to own less (within the
meaning of Code Section 355(e)) than the Comcast Shareholder Percentage
(clause (z) being referred to herein as the "Tax Standstill Governance
Provisions").   

  

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Comcast shall be a third-party
beneficiary of the Tax Standstill Governance Provisions. In addition,
amendment of the Tax Standstill Governance Provisions shall require the
affirmative vote of 80% of SpinCo's shareholders and the affirmative vote of
80% of the members of the SpinCo board.

Future SpinCo Transactions

  |  

Charter Purchase Restriction: From and after the second anniversary of Closing
until the fourth anniversary of Closing, New Charter and its controlled
affiliates shall not acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) of any additional SpinCo shares
if such acquisition would result in New Charter and its controlled affiliates
beneficially owning in excess of 49% of the then-outstanding shares of SpinCo
at such time (the "New Charter Ownership Cap"), other than any purchase in a
transaction that is approved by: (i) a majority of the independent members of
the SpinCo board; or (ii) a majority of SpinCo shareholders (other than New
Charter). From and after the second anniversary of Closing until the fourth
anniversary of Closing, SpinCo shall not take any action that would result in
an increase in the percentage of outstanding shares of SpinCo owned by New
Charter above the New Charter Ownership Cap (e.g., a repurchase of shares by
SpinCo), other than any action that is approved by a majority of the
independent members of the SpinCo board. For the avoidance of doubt, no
increase in the percentage of outstanding shares of SpinCo owned by New
Charter without the acquisition of beneficial ownership of SpinCo shares by
New Charter (e.g., because of a repurchase of shares by SpinCo) shall be
deemed to be a breach of the first sentence of this paragraph.

  

  

New Charter and its controlled affiliates shall not be subject to any
restriction on holding, acquiring or transferring SpinCo shares or other
equity other than as set forth in the prior sentence, and SpinCo shall not
adopt any shareholder rights plan or similar plan or agreement (or amend or
modify any such plan or agreement) or adopt or approve any charter or by-law
provision, in each case, the purpose or effect of which is to restrict or
limit New Charter's or its controlled affiliates' ability to take

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | any actions not inconsistent with the restrictions set forth in the
prior sentence (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, this section shall
not be interpreted to prohibit SpinCo's ability to restrict the acquisition of
shares by persons other than New Charter and its controlled affiliates in a
manner that does not specifically prohibit persons from acquiring shares from
New Charter or its controlled affiliates).   

  

The purchase restrictions on New Charter and its controlled affiliates set
forth in this section shall terminate and be of no further force and effect in
the event: (x) a party other than New Charter or its affiliates (which term
includes, for the avoidance of doubt, Liberty and its affiliates, including
Liberty Interactive Corporation and any "Related Entity" (as defined in the
voting agreement entered into by Liberty and Comcast in connection with entry
into this Agreement)) enters into a definitive agreement providing for such
party's acquisition of at least 25% of the assets or equity of SpinCo or
commences a bona fide tender or exchange offer for at least 25% of SpinCo's
then-outstanding shares, (y) any person or group (within the meaning of the
Exchange Act) other than New Charter or its affiliates (which term includes,
for the avoidance of doubt, Liberty or its affiliates, including Liberty
Interactive Corporation and any Related Entity) acquires beneficial ownership
of 15% or more of the then-outstanding shares of SpinCo at such time or (z)
New Charter and its controlled affiliates cease to beneficially own in excess
of 15% of the then-outstanding shares of SpinCo or at any time beneficially
own at least 90% of the then-outstanding shares of SpinCo as a result of
acquisitions in compliance with the purchase restrictions of this section;
provided that, in the case of clause (x), in the event the transaction related
to such matter has not occurred and has been terminated within 12 months of
the date on which the purchase restrictions terminated (or is terminated at
any time after such 12 month period), then the purchase restrictions shall
thereafter resume and continue to apply in accordance with the terms of this
section, provided, however, that if, at such time, the beneficial ownership of
New Charter and its controlled affiliates as a percentage of the then-
outstanding shares of SpinCo shall be in excess of the New Charter Ownership
Cap, the term "New Charter Ownership Cap" shall be deemed to be such greater
percentage beneficial ownership.

  

  

If SpinCo becomes insolvent or becomes the subject of bankruptcy proceedings,
the foregoing shall not restrict New Charter or its controlled affiliates from
seeking to enforce its rights and otherwise obtain recourse as a creditor of
SpinCo.

  

  

Comcast Purchase Restriction: From and after Closing until the eighth
anniversary of Closing, none of Comcast or its controlled affiliates shall
acquire beneficial ownership of any SpinCo shares if such acquisition would
result in Comcast and its controlled affiliates beneficially owning in excess
of 1% of the then-outstanding shares of SpinCo at such time,

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | provided that in the event such ownership in excess of 1% is in a
purely de minimis amount or on a purely transitory basis, Comcast (or its
applicable affiliate) shall be able to cure such violation by disposing of
SpinCo shares to cause its compliance. If SpinCo becomes insolvent or becomes
the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, the foregoing shall not restrict
Comcast or its controlled affiliates from seeking to enforce its rights and
otherwise obtain recourse as a creditor of SpinCo.   

  

Affiliate Transactions: New Charter and its affiliates shall not enter into
any transaction with SpinCo other than: (x) any transaction pursuant to any
agreement in place at the Closing; (y) any transaction that has been approved
by a majority of the independent directors of SpinCo; or (z) any transaction
on arms-length terms with a value of $10 million or less.

Swap Assets and Liabilities

  |  

The systems currently owned by TWC or Charter in the DMAs or sections of DMAs
set forth under the 'Total TWC' and 'Charter' headings, respectively, on
Schedule 2 shall be conveyed in the Swap or, solely in the case of systems
owned by TWC, the Taxable Purchase. The division of such assets between the
Swap and the Taxable Purchase shall be determined by the parties on the basis
of achieving the most tax efficient result in the aggregate (the "Schedule 2
Division"), which determination shall be completed as promptly as practicable
after the date of this agreement, but no later than the date the Long-Form
Agreements are executed.

  

  

To the extent determined to be part of the Swap by the parties as part of the
Schedule 2 Division, Comcast shall convey the systems currently owned by TWC
in the DMAs or sections of DMAs set out on Schedule 2 (the "Comcast Swap
Footprint") and their actual subscribers, and all other assets (including
employees) primarily related thereto (the "Comcast Swap Systems"), in exchange
for the systems currently owned by Charter in the DMAs or sections of DMAs set
out on Schedule 2 (the "Charter Swap Footprint") and their actual subscribers,
and all other assets (including employees) primarily related thereto (the
"Charter Swap Systems"), as provided below.

  

  

The assets and liabilities transferred by Comcast in the Swap will include
assets and liabilities related to the Comcast Swap Footprint to the same
extent as such assets or liabilities would be included in the SpinCo Assets or
SpinCo Liabilities if the Comcast Swap Footprint were in the SpinCo Footprint
(such assets and liabilities to be referred to as the "Comcast Swapped Assets"
and the "Comcast Swapped Liabilities"). Likewise, the assets and liabilities
transferred by Charter in the Swap will include assets and liabilities related
to the Charter Swap Footprint to the same extent as such assets or liabilities
would be included in the SpinCo Assets or SpinCo Liabilities if the Charter
Swap Footprint were in the SpinCo

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | Footprint (such assets and liabilities to be referred to as the
"Charter Swapped Assets" and the "Charter Swapped Liabilities").   

  

The Swap shall be completed as an exchange of property to which Section 1031
of the Code applies. For the avoidance of doubt, the like-kind exchange shall
be done on a debt-free basis, with all systems delivered with normalized
working capital at Closing, and a cash equalization payment shall be made to
the extent of any difference in the Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the systems on
each side of the Swap multiplied by 7.125. Following the Closing, there shall
be true ups between Comcast and Charter with respect to the Comcast Swap
Systems and the Charter Swap Systems, based on the product of (a) Carveout
2014 EBITDA of the Comcast Swap Systems or the Charter Swap Systems, as
applicable, multiplied by (b) 7.125, as well as true ups based on any net
working capital variance in respect of either the Comcast Swap Systems or the
Charter Swap Systems (based on an agreed amount of normalized target working
capital in each case). The true ups shall be subject to the dispute resolution
procedures described under "Dispute Resolution Procedures" below.

  

  

The Swap shall be effected through a "qualified intermediary" engaged by the
parties to effectuate a like-kind exchange under Code Section 1031.

   
---|--- 
  

Taxable Purchase Assets and Liabilities

  |  

To the extent determined by the parties as part of the Schedule 2 Division,
Comcast shall convey the systems currently owned by TWC in the DMAs or
sections of DMAs set out on Schedule 2 (the "Taxable Purchase Footprint") and
their actual subscribers, and all other assets (including employees) primarily
related thereto (the "Taxable Purchase Systems"), for the consideration
described under "Taxable Purchase Consideration" below.

  

  

The assets and liabilities transferred by Comcast in the Taxable Purchase will
include assets and liabilities related to the Taxable Purchase Footprint to
the same extent as such assets or liabilities would be included in the SpinCo
Assets or SpinCo Liabilities if the Taxable Purchase Footprint were in the
SpinCo Footprint (such assets and liabilities to be referred to as the
"Taxable Purchase Assets" and the "Taxable Purchase Liabilities"). Taxable
Purchase Assets that would constitute SpinCo Non-Systems Assets if they were
included in the SpinCo Assets are referred to as "Taxable Purchase Non-System
Assets."

  

  

The allocation of the consideration payable in the Taxable Purchase shall be
determined pursuant to a third party valuation performed by an independent
appraisal firm selected by Charter and which appraisal firm is reasonably
acceptable to Comcast (the "Final Allocation"), provided that Comcast shall
not be required to take any position on a tax return consistent

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | with such allocation if Comcast in good faith believes such
position would be inconsistent with any other position taken by Comcast on a
tax return.  
---|--- 
  

Taxable Purchase Consideration

  |  

The consideration payable in the Taxable Purchase shall be the sum of (1) the
product of (x) Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the Taxable Purchase Systems multiplied
by (y) 7.125 and (2) the fair market value of the Taxable Purchase Non-System
Assets; and such consideration shall be payable by Charter in cash.

  

Following the Closing there shall be a true up between Comcast and Charter
based on the product of (a) Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the Taxable Purchase
Systems multiplied by (b) 7.125, as well as a true up based on any net working
capital variance (based on an agreed amount of normalized target working
capital). The true ups shall be subject to the Dispute Resolution Procedures.

  

In addition, Charter shall pay Comcast for the value of the step-up as
provided in Annex B.

   
  

Dispute Resolution Procedures

  |  

The true ups shall be subject to customary dispute resolution procedures (the
"Dispute Resolution Procedures"), including the following:

  

* Comcast, Charter and/or SpinCo, as applicable, shall deliver final reports with respect to Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the relevant systems and the relevant net working capital (if applicable) by the later of (a) April 15, 2015 and (b) the 30th day following Closing,

  

  

* The other party shall have a 30-calendar-day period following delivery of the report to review, have accountants verify, and give notice of any objections with respect to the report,

  

  

* If notice of an objection is delivered within the 30-calendar-day review period, the parties shall have a 20-calendar-day period to negotiate with respect to such dispute, and

  

  

* If the parties are not able to resolve such dispute within the 20-calendar-day negotiation period, the amounts in dispute shall be subject to customary review and resolution by an independent accountant selected from a list of accounting firms of recognized national standing to be agreed by the parties; provided that if, at such time, the parties have not been able to agree a list of accounting firms for this purpose, then each of the parties shall select one independent accountant of recognized national standing, and those two accountants shall select a third, independent accountant of recognized national standing to review and resolve the amounts in dispute. Any amounts in dispute resolved by the independent 

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

accountant shall not be resolved in a manner more favorable to a party than
the terms proposed by such party.

   
---|---

  |  

Completion of each Transaction shall be subject to

  

  

* completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction,

  

  

* receipt of FCC and DOJ approvals for each of the Transactions without the imposition of a "Charter/Comcast Burdensome Condition" (as defined below),

  

  

* receipt of franchise approvals for each of the Transactions (subject to thresholds for approvals or absence of approval requirements covering (x) 80% of video subscribers, with such threshold determined with respect to the Comcast Swap Systems and the Taxable Purchase Systems in the aggregate, and (y) 85% of video subscribers, with such threshold determined separately with respect to each of (1) the SpinCo Systems and (2) the Charter Swap Systems),

  

  

* receipt of all required PUC approvals for each of the Transactions, without the imposition of a "Charter/Comcast Burdensome Condition",

  

  

* requisite vote of Charter stockholders (Comcast shall provide stockholder consent as SpinCo's sole shareholder),

  

  

* absence of injunction or legal impediment on any of the Transactions,

  

  

* accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to each of the Transactions,

  

  

* opinions of counsel as to the tax-free nature of (i) the Contribution and Spin-Off, (ii) the Debt-for-Debt Exchange and (iii) the Merger and the Charter Reorganization, taken together, in each case based on customary representations of the parties (the "Tax Opinions"),

  

  

* performance of covenants with respect to each of the Transactions (including TWC covenants with respect to the applicable Comcast Swapped Assets through the closing of the Comcast-TWC Transaction),

  

  

* with respect to Charter's obligations, absence of a material adverse change with respect to the SpinCo Assets, SpinCo Liabilities, Comcast Swapped Assets , Comcast Swapped Liabilities, Taxable Purchase Assets and Taxable Purchase Liabilities, taken as a whole,

  

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

* with respect to Comcast's obligations, absence of a material adverse change with respect to the Charter Swapped Assets and Charter Swapped Liabilities, taken as a whole

  

  

* with respect to Comcast's obligations, absence of a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Charter (with the term "Material Adverse Effect" to be defined to mirror the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" in the Comcast-TWC merger agreement, as appropriately supplemented and/or adjusted to reflect the Transactions),

  

  

* with respect to Charter's obligations, absence of the assertion by Charter's financing sources for the Taxable Purchase of a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Charter (with the term "Material Adverse Effect" to be defined to mirror the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" in the Comcast-TWC merger agreement, as appropriately supplemented and/or adjusted to reflect the Transactions),

  

  

* listing of the SpinCo shares, and

  

  

* effectiveness of registration statement for New Charter shares to be issued in the Merger and approval of listing on the NASDAQ.

  

  

Completion of the Swap (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no other
Transactions) shall be further subject to the absence of a change in law that
would cause the Swap to not be treated as a tax-free exchange of property
under Code Section 1031. In the event of such a change in law, the parties
shall reasonably cooperate to restructure the Transactions in order to achieve
the intended benefits of the Transactions (including the Swap).

  

  

Where the above closing conditions have corresponding closing conditions in
the Comcast-TWC Transaction, such closing conditions will mirror such
corresponding closing conditions (including with respect to any materiality
and "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers, and including that "Material Adverse
Effect" shall be defined to mirror the term "Company Material Adverse Effect"
in the Comcast-TWC merger agreement), in each case as may be appropriately
supplemented and/or adjusted to reflect the Transactions and the express terms
of the above closing conditions; provided that the foregoing shall be without
prejudice to any of the above closing conditions that are in addition to or
otherwise do not have corresponding closing conditions in the Comcast-TWC
Transaction.

   
---|--- 
  

Closing

  |  

The parties intend that the Transactions shall be consummated (the "Closing")
substantially contemporaneously with each other, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions described above.

   
  

Representations and Warranties

  |  

Comcast to make customary representations and warranties as of signing

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | and as of the Closing as to the SpinCo Assets, SpinCo Liabilities,
Comcast Swapped Assets, Comcast Swapped Liabilities, Taxable Purchase Assets
and Taxable Purchase Liabilities.   

  

Charter to make customary representations and warranties as of signing and as
of the Closing as to the Charter Swapped Assets and Charter Swapped
Liabilities.

  

Where the Transactions and the Comcast-TWC Transaction have corresponding
representations and warranties, the representations and warranties in the
Transactions shall mirror the corresponding representations and warranties in
the Comcast-TWC Transactions, in each case as may be appropriately
supplemented and/or adjusted to reflect the Transactions; provided that the
foregoing shall be without prejudice to the inclusion of customary
representations and warranties in the Transaction that are in addition to or
otherwise do not have corresponding representations and warranties in the
Comcast-TWC Transaction.

  

  

Comcast has obtained the irrevocable consent of TWC to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such consent constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
TWC, enforceable against TWC in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity). Such consent is effective, non-withdrawable and not
subject to any condition or the performance of any obligation

Interim Operating Covenants

  |  

SpinCo Assets, Comcast Swapped Assets and Taxable Purchase Assets (to the
extent currently owned by Comcast) to be operated by Comcast in the ordinary
course of business and pursuant to customary limitations/commitments.

  

  

Charter shall have the benefit of the covenants in the Comcast-TWC merger
agreement with respect to Comcast Swapped Assets and Taxable Purchase Assets
(to the extent currently owned by TWC), and Comcast shall provide the same
covenants to Charter for SpinCo Assets , Comcast Swapped Assets and Taxable
Purchase Assets (to the extent currently owned by Comcast).

  

  

Charter Swapped Assets to be operated by Charter in the ordinary course of
business and pursuant to customary operational limitations/commitments, which,
as may be appropriately supplemented and/or adjusted to reflect the specific
assets, shall mirror the operational limitations/commitments applicable to the
SpinCo Assets, Comcast Swapped Assets and Taxable Purchase Assets.

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     |  

The parties (in conjunction with TWC) shall cooperate to produce forthwith and
as promptly as practicable audited pro-forma financial statements reflecting
the respective separate pools of assets/liabilities ("Pro-Forma Financial
Statements") to be transferred under this agreement; it being understood that
the goal is to permit the parties to access credit markets at the earliest
possible date after signing of this agreement. Each of Comcast, SpinCo and
Charter shall utilize the Pro-Forma Financial Statements in order to complete
its financing and shall have overall supervision for the financial statements
to be used in its financing documents. In connection with the foregoing, the
parties and TWC shall provide each other with access and information as may be
customary or necessary in connection with the access of the credit markets.

  

  

Each party shall have customary access to information, personnel and diligence
of the other party, including with respect to existing affiliate relationships
relating to the SpinCo Assets, Comcast Swap Systems, Charter Swap Systems and
Taxable Purchase Systems.

  

  

Prior to consummation of the Transactions, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts consistent with this agreement to cause the
Transactions to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. Each of the parties
shall use its good faith efforts to obtain the Tax Opinions, including giving
customary representation letters. Each of the parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action (or fail to take or
cause to be taken any action) that would cause to be untrue any of the
representations set forth in such party's respective representation letter.

  

  

Charter shall not, at any time that would reasonably be expected to fall
within the 100-calendar-day period ending on Closing, split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the shares of its common stock, or declare, set aside or
make any dividend or other distribution to its shareholders (whether cash or
stock), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
exchange or other like change, or redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of its common stock or publicly announce any intention to do any of the
foregoing (other than redemptions pursuant to the exercise of, or the
withholding of taxes in connection with, any compensatory equity awards or the
net-issuance exercise of any currently-outstanding warrants). If, due to
uncertainty as to when the Closing will occur or for any other reason, Charter
takes any of the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence within the
100-calendar-day period ending on Closing, then such Charter action shall not
be deemed to be a breach of a covenant, but instead the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the impact of such event.

  |  

Comcast to indemnify Charter post-closing for (a) liabilities not included in

(b) covenant breaches by SpinCo.

Termination

  |  

The agreements for each of the Transactions shall be terminable:

  

  

* upon termination of the Comcast-TWC Transaction,

  

  

* by either party on material breach of the other party, subject to cure provisions,

  

  

* upon any final and non-appealable injunction or legal impediment,

  

  

* as contemplated on Schedule 1,

  

  

* in the event the Charter Shareholder Vote is not obtained at the Charter Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof),

  

  

* solely by Comcast, in the event the Charter board of directors makes an adverse change to its recommendation that Charter shareholders approve the requisite vote, and

  

  

* if the Transactions have not been consummated by:

  

  

o if each of (i) the waiting periods under the HSR Act applicable to the
Transactions shall have been terminated or expired (and no court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered an order enjoining the Transactions), (ii) the
FCC issues its decision (or decisions) (which shall be defined in a manner
that mirrors the term "FCC Order" in the Comcast-TWC merger agreement)
consenting to the Transactions and (iii) the closing conditions relating

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

to franchise approvals and PUC approvals have been satisfied or waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof (the "Required Transaction
Approvals") at or before the completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction, then
60 calendar days after the completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction; provided
that if, on or prior to such 60th calendar day, the tender offer for Comcast's
outstanding debt has been launched as contemplated by Schedule 1, then the 60
calendar day period noted above shall be extended for an additional 30
calendar days; or

  

  

o if any of the Required Transaction Approvals are not received at or before
the completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction, then 150 calendar days after
the completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction, provided that, if at the 75th
calendar day after the completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction, all closing
conditions are satisfied or waived (other than conditions that are only
capable of being satisfied at closing) other than the closing conditions
relating to franchise approvals or PUC approvals, such 150 day period shall be
extended by 90 days to provide additional time to obtain such approvals.

   
---|--- 
  

Regulatory Matters

  |  

The parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all approvals
required to be obtained from any governmental authority or third party in
order to consummate the Transactions (the "Approvals"), subject to (with
respect to all parties) the limitations of "Burdensome Condition" provided for
in the Comcast-TWC merger agreement, provided that there shall be no
requirement to make any divestitures; provided, further, that no condition or
action shall constitute a "Burdensome Condition" to the extent related to
franchises or RSNs (a "Charter/Comcast Burdensome Condition"). The parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this paragraph shall restrict any
party's practice of making efforts, taking positions and requesting approvals
and/or consents for a variety of matters from a variety of regulators (which
efforts, positions or requested approvals and/or consents may be inconsistent
with or contrast with those made, taken or requested by the other party). The
parties shall seek to obtain the Approvals at the same time Comcast and TWC
receive approvals required from any governmental authority or third party in
order to consummate the Comcast-TWC Transaction, it being understood that
nothing in this sentence will prevent Comcast from complying with its
obligations under the Comcast-TWC merger agreement or waiving any conditions
to completion of the Comcast-TWC Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Comcast-TWC Transaction is completed, any condition that is imposed on and
accepted by Comcast to facilitate providing or obtaining required regulatory
approvals for the Comcast-TWC Transaction, other than any condition that

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | relates solely to Transaction Assets for which there is no
substantially similar condition that relates to assets other than Transaction
Assets, may not be invoked by Comcast as a Burdensome Condition to allow
Comcast not to proceed with the Transactions.   

  

Within 30 days after the date of this agreement, Comcast and Charter shall use
reasonable best efforts to file, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause TWC to file, (i) appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms
pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR
Act") with respect to the Transactions, (ii) all necessary filings to obtain
consents from the FCC (including FCC applications and public interest
statements) that are required in connection with the Transactions and (iii)
all necessary filings to obtain consents from the state regulators and the
franchise authorities that are required in connection with the Transactions.
The Hart-Scott-Rodino notifications and the FCC applications and public
interest statements with respect to the Transactions shall request, and
Comcast and Charter shall reasonably advocate, that the DOJ and FCC evaluate
and terminate any investigation of the Transactions and the Comcast-TWC
Transaction simultaneously. In addition, Comcast shall promptly after the date
of this agreement notify the FCC of the anticipated timing of the filing of
the FCC applications and public interest statements in connection with the
Transactions, and shall request that the FCC defer issuing a public notice
regarding the FCC filings in connection with the Comcast-TWC Transaction
("Comcast-TWC Public Notice") until the FCC applications and public interest
statements in connection with the Transactions have been filed. If the FCC has
issued the Comcast-TWC Public Notice before this agreement is executed,
Comcast agrees upon execution to immediately request that the FCC establish
common comment cycles for both transactions with similar due dates. Comcast
shall also promptly provide to Charter copies of all LFA filings that have
been made with respect to the Comcast-TWC Transaction and relate to cable
systems subject to the Transactions.

   
---|--- 
  

Further Assurances

  |  

Other than with respect to regulatory matters (which are addressed under
"Regulatory Matters" above), the parties agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions and do all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate the Transactions and not to take any actions or do any things
that have a primary purpose of materially delaying, impeding or otherwise
interfering with consummation of the Transactions.

   
  

Intended Tax Treatment

  |  

The Contribution and the Spin-Off are intended to be treated as a tax free
reorganization within the meaning of Code Section 368(a)(1)(D) and a tax-free
distribution within the meaning of Code Section 355.

  

  

The Debt-for-Debt Exchange is intended to be treated as a tax free exchange
within the meaning of Code Section 355 and Code Section 361.

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

The Merger and the Charter Reorganization, taken together, are intended to be
treated as a tax-free transaction described in Code Section 351.

  

  

The Swap is intended to be treated as an exchange of property to which Code
Section 1031 applies.

  

  

The foregoing being referred to as the "Intended Tax Treatment."

   
---|--- 
  

Employees

  |  

Charter will comply with Comcast\'s obligations with respect to the treatment
of, and compensation and benefits provided to, former TWC employees who become
Charter employees pursuant to the Swap or the Taxable Purchase to the extent
contemplated by Section 7.09 of the Comcast-TWC merger agreement and
applicable law (generally for one year following the Comcast-TWC Transaction).
Comcast will also treat (and Charter and Comcast will use reasonable best
efforts to cause SpinCo to agree to treat), and will provide compensation and
benefits to (and Charter and Comcast will use reasonable best efforts to cause
SpinCo to agree to provide compensation and benefits to), former employees of
Charter and Comcast who become employees of another party (including SpinCo)
in the Spin-Off or Swap, as applicable, to the same extent of the foregoing
(generally for one year following the closing of the Spin-Off and Swap, as
applicable). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing obligations shall
exclude and take no account of equity and equity-based compensation.

   
  

Transition and Support and Commercial Arrangements

  |  

The parties shall agree reasonably and in good faith on any transition
services, ongoing back-office support or other arrangements necessary to
facilitate the continued operation of the business of the applicable assets
being acquired by SpinCo, Comcast and New Charter (the "Transition Services").
Accordingly, the parties shall work together in good faith (a) to identify
assets that are not SpinCo Assets, Retained Assets, Comcast Swapped Assets,
Charter Swapped Assets or Taxable Purchase Assets (together, the "Transaction
Assets"), but that are used in the conduct of the business involving such
Transaction Assets and (b) to mutually identify and structure the Transition
Services. From and after the closing, each party shall provide any Transition
Services to the other party or SpinCo, or SpinCo shall provide any Transition
Services to Comcast, as applicable, at actual, incremental cost without
overhead allocations, in a manner consistent with the manner provided prior to
the Closing.

  

  

The parties agree that in the event there are contractual or legal
restrictions on the provision of services, the parties shall work in good
faith to structure alternative arrangements on substantially similar terms.
The parties also agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no party shall be required to transfer any Transaction Assets if such
attempted transfer would be restricted by contractual or legal limitations,

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | in which case the parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain third party consents, waivers or amendments necessary or
advisable to complete any transfer of Transaction Assets or, failing that, to
structure alternative arrangements reasonably acceptable to the parties.   

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties shall cooperate to design and
implement a plan with respect to the employees of the transferred systems,
which may include a leasing or transfer arrangement, so as to avoid
disruption, collective-bargaining issues, severance costs or the incurrence of
liabilities relating to such employees, consistent with achieving the overall
commercial objectives of the Transactions.

  

  

The parties shall cooperate to evaluate all potential synergies and to work in
good faith to maximize realization of identified potential synergies available
in the Transactions.

  

  

Neither Charter nor Comcast will, nor will they permit any of their controlled
subsidiaries (after giving effect to the Transactions) to, exercise any right
of termination that may result from the consummation of the Transactions under
any RSN Carriage Agreement. If any RSN Carriage Agreement that, prior to the
Closing, was an intercompany agreement between Comcast entities, TWC entities
or Charter entities, provides for termination or non-renewal without cause at
any time during the one year following the Closing, then such right shall
instead be deemed to be exercisable no earlier than on the first anniversary
of the Closing and the agreement shall otherwise be construed accordingly.

  

  

"RSN Carriage Agreement" means any carriage agreement with respect to an RSN,
between (after giving effect to the Transactions) (i) Comcast or any of its
controlled subsidiaries (including any business included in the Retained
Assets or the Charter Swapped Assets) and (ii) Charter or any of its
controlled subsidiaries (including any business included in the SpinCo Assets,
the Comcast Swapped Assets or the Taxable Purchase Assets).

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the treatment of the Charter/NBCU affiliate
agreement shall be governed by the terms of "NBCU Affiliate Agreement" below
and not by this section.

  

  

Other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all Intercompany
Agreements shall be terminated as of the Closing. "Intercompany Agreements"
means all agreements or arrangements between (i) Comcast (other than any
Transaction Assets) and the Retained Assets, on the one hand, and the SpinCo
Assets, the Comcast Swapped Assets or the Taxable Purchase Assets, on the
other hand, and (ii) Charter (other than any Transaction Assets), on the one
hand, and the Charter Swapped Assets,

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | on the other hand.  
---|--- 
  

Expenses

  |  

Except as set forth on Schedule 1, each party will be responsible for its own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and
performance of this agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth
on Schedule 1, Charter shall be responsible for all its financing and advisory
costs and Comcast shall be responsible for all costs relating to the Comcast-
TWC Transaction and all Comcast deal expenses. All SpinCo expenses (including
financing costs) will be borne in the manner provided on Schedule 1. Any
SpinCo deal expenses that are liabilities of SpinCo as of the Closing shall be
excluded from the calculation of working capital for SpinCo.

   
  

Transfer Taxes

  |  

Transfer taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be allocated
among the parties as follows:

  

  

* with respect to the Contribution and Spin-Off, SpinCo shall be liable for 100% of any transfer taxes;

  

  

* with respect to the Taxable Purchase, Comcast and Charter shall each be liable for 50% of any transfer taxes; and

  

  

* with respect to the Swap, Comcast shall be liable for any transfer taxes incurred on the transfer of the Comcast Swapped Assets and Charter shall be liable for any transfer taxes incurred on the transfer of the Charter Swapped Assets.

   
  

Antidilution Right

After the second anniversary of Closing, as an antidilution protection New
Charter shall have proportional preemptive rights on any future issuance of
SpinCo stock or other equity (or options or other rights to purchase equity,
or securities or other instruments convertible into equity) in order to
receive shares in addition to those issued to other parties sufficient to
maintain New Charter's proportionate ownership at such time, other than
issuances in respect of bona fide employment/ compensation plans approved by
the SpinCo board. The preemptive rights set forth in this section shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect in the event New Charter and
its controlled affiliates cease to beneficially own in excess of 5% of the
then-outstanding shares of SpinCo at any time.

   
  

Terms Used in This Agreement

  |  

When used in this agreement, the term "Carveout 2014 EBITDA" (or any defined
term incorporating "Carveout 2014 EBITDA") shall reflect the following:

  

  

Carveout 2014 EBITDA shall be calculated to include all of the revenue and
direct and fully allocated indirect costs of Comcast, TWC or Charter currently
associated with the respective transferred systems (but shall not

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | include costs related to share-based compensation). Indirect costs
shall include all shared service costs, regional management and corporate
overhead such that all expenses included in each company\'s "EBITDA" for
external reporting purposes shall be fully allocated across the respective
company\'s footprint. With respect to any shared service center, regional and
corporate overheads (and similar categories), the overheads of each company
will be allocated pro-rata based on video customer relationships at the last
quarter end prior to closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree
that, with respect to Comcast Corporation overhead (outside of Comcast Cable
costs, which for the avoidance of doubt should be fully allocated as
previously described), $22 million of overhead shall be allocated to the
SpinCo Assets. In addition, solely for purposes of calculating the
consideration payable in the Taxable Purchase, Carveout 2014 EBITDA of the
Taxable Purchase Systems shall be reduced by $22 million. For the avoidance of
doubt, Carveout 2014 EBITDA shall be calculated on an as-is basis and not
reflecting any planned changes to cost structure, including the payment of the
Services Fee.   

  

All calculations of Carveout 2014 EBITDA will be made:

  

  

(i) in the case of a Closing in 2014, based on a mutually agreed determination
of LTM EBITDA,

  

  

(ii) in the case of a Closing in 2015, based on a mutually agreed
determination of 2014 EBITDA, and

  

  

(iii) in any case (other than a Closing on the basis of audited SpinCo
financial statements for fiscal year 2014), subject to post closing audit (in
the case of a Closing in 2015) or special report by SpinCo's auditors (in the
case of a Closing in 2014) and adjustment, on the basis of consistency with
GAAP and prior periods with consistent application (except to the extent this
agreement requires any other method of calculation (e.g., allocation of
Comcast Corporation overhead)).

   
---|--- 
  

Governing Law; Jurisdiction

  |  

Delaware law, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  

  

The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby
(whether brought by any party or any of its affiliates or against any party or
any of its affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if
such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided pursuant to "Notices"
below shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.  
---|--- 
  

Definitive Agreement

  |  

Charter and Comcast agree and acknowledge that this agreement contains all the
material terms necessary to the Transactions and that this agreement
constitutes a legally binding agreement of Charter and Comcast to enter into,
and consummate, the Transactions contemplated by this agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  

  

Each of Charter and Comcast shall use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate
and enter into (and cause SpinCo to enter into) more detailed agreements with
respect to the Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this
agreement (collectively, the "Long-Form Agreements") as promptly as reasonably
practicable; provided, that unless and until the Long-Form Agreements are
executed, Charter and Comcast shall continue to be bound to complete the
Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions herein provided. If
Charter and Comcast have not entered into the Long-Form Agreements by the date
that is 120 days after the date of this agreement, then Charter and Comcast
shall submit (and, if either Charter or Comcast fails to join such submission,
the other may independently submit) any remaining unresolved or otherwise
undecided terms of the proposed Long-Form Agreements for decision and final
resolution to binding arbitration to the exclusion of any courts of law, with
such arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association in
accordance with the then most current version of its commercial arbitration
rules and otherwise in accordance with Annex C. The foregoing shall not
prejudice any right of a party to seek an order compelling arbitration.

   
  

Meeting of Charter Shareholders; Charter Board Recommendation

  |  

Charter shall cause a meeting of Charter shareholders (the "Charter
Shareholder Meeting") to be held for purposes of obtaining the requisite vote
of Charter shareholders (the "Charter Shareholder Vote") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Pro-Forma Financial Statements are available.
The Charter board shall recommend that Charter shareholders approve the
requisite vote, provided that, in their sole determination, the Charter board
may change their recommendation with respect to the requisite vote if the
board determines in good faith, after

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; provided, however, that no change in recommendation by the Charter board
shall affect Charter's obligations to hold the meeting of Charter shareholders
for the purpose of obtaining the requisite vote.  
---|--- 
  

SEC Filings

  |  

Each party shall afford the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon any registration statement, proxy statement or other document
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in
connection with the Transactions (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the
Comcast-TWC Transaction) (collectively, the "SEC Filings"), and shall consider
any comments of the other party thereon. Neither party shall include any
information in any such filing with respect to the other party without the
prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Each party shall promptly provide the other party with any comments,
whether written or oral, that such party receives from the SEC or its staff
with respect to any SEC Filings.

  

  

Each party agrees that the information contained in such party's SEC Filings
(other than information provided by the other party for use in such SEC
Filings) and the information provided by such party for use in the other
party's SEC Filings shall be true and correct in all material respects and
shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable
federal securities laws. Each party agrees to indemnify the other for any
damage, loss, liability and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding) resulting from
such information being inaccurate, incomplete or misleading.

  

  

Each party agrees promptly (x) to correct any information contained in its SEC
Filings (other than any information provided by the other party for use in
such SEC Filings) or provided by it for use in the other party's SEC Filings
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false and
misleading in any material respect and (y) to supplement any such information
to include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

   
  

Press Releases; Public Communications

  |  

The execution of this agreement shall be announced pursuant to a joint press
release to be in the form agreed by the parties. Each party shall consult with
the other party before issuing or making any press release or other public
statement (whether written or oral), including any soliciting material, with
respect to the Transactions that contains information regarding the
Transactions or the other party that is in addition to, or inconsistent with,
information contained in public statements previously made, or consented to,
by such other party and shall give good faith consideration

   
 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     | to any comments proposed by the other party, and will not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law, court process or
the rules or regulations of any national securities exchange.  
---|--- 
  

Litigation

  |  

Each party will (a) give the other party prompt notice of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding involving the
notifying party and arising as a result of, or in connection with, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this agreement, the Long-Form
Agreements or the consummation of the Transactions ("Action"), (b) keep the
other party reasonably informed of all significant developments relating to
any Action and (c) consult and cooperate with the other party in good faith
with regard to the management, prosecution, defense, compromise and settlement
of the Action. No party shall settle, agree to any undertakings or approve or
otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in connection with any
Action, to the extent such settlement, undertaking, approval or waiver
modifies this agreement or the Long-Form Agreements, impedes or materially
delays the consummation of the Transactions, or adversely affects the SpinCo
Assets, the Comcast Swap Systems, the Charter Swap Systems or the Taxable
Purchase Systems, without the prior written consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

   
  

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

  |  

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

   
  

Binding Effect; Benefit

  |  

The provisions of this agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
No provision of this agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any person other than the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither party
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this agreement without the consent of the other party.

   
  

Entire Agreement

  |  

This agreement (including the annexes and schedules) constitutes the entire
agreement between Charter and Comcast with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between Charter and Comcast with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective.

Severability

  |  

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this letter is held by a

restrictions of this letter will remain in full force and effect

   
  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

     | and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this letter
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

In consideration of the above terms and conditions and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby as of the date
first set forth above, have set their hands below. Each of the parties hereby
represents, warranties, agrees and acknowledges that the execution, delivery
and performance by such party of this agreement is within such party's
corporate (or other entity) powers and has been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate (or other entity) action on the part of such party, and
that this agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such party
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.

  

  

Each party also hereby represents, warranties, agrees and acknowledges that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor, and accordingly the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts referenced
under the caption "Governing Law; Jurisdiction" above without proof of actual
damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the security or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

ANNEX A: GOVERNANCE, MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES FRAMEWORK

  


 

  


 

  

Board of Directors:

  

    

  |  

1.

  |  

The Board of Directors of SpinCo following the Merger shall consist of nine
members and shall have the authority and responsibilities established by
Delaware law for the board of a Delaware corporation.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

2.

  |  

The initial board members shall be selected in the manner set forth in the
term sheet.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

3.

  |  

The role of non-executive Chairman of the Board and President shall be
separated, with the initial Chairman of the Board following the Merger being
one of the former directors of Merger Sub. The President shall report to the
Board and, subject to the ultimate authority of the Board, shall report to the
Chairman of the Board. The Board shall also have one or more Vice Chairmen,
one of whom shall be one of the former directors of Merger Sub.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

4.

  |  

Management will report to the Board as contemplated by Delaware law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Board shall have ultimate authority as to the hiring,
compensation and termination of the Executive Management team.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

  

Executive Management:

  

    

  |  

1.

  |  

SpinCo shall have an independent Executive Management team. For this purpose,
an individual is "independent" if he or she is not an officer, director or
employee of Charter or any of its affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, SpinCo). The Executive Management will initially be the executive
management of Merger Sub.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

2.

  |  

The Executive Management team shall include, among others, a President, Chief
Financial and Accounting Officer, Human Resources Executive, General Counsel
and other senior executives performing functions typically performed by senior
executives of public companies in a business similar to the business of SpinCo
(including executives in charge of: engineering/technology, tax, treasury,
investor relations, business development, public relations and
government/regulatory affairs). For the avoidance of doubt, the President
shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of SpinCo, and the SpinCo Board may
determine that certain of the other senior executive functions described in
the prior sentence may be combined with the responsibilities of another
officer, such determination to be reasonable and consistent with customary
practices of public companies in a business similar to the business of SpinCo.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

3.

  |  

Subject to the authority of the board, the Executive Management team shall
have the authority and responsibility that is typically associated with the
positions of individuals performing similar roles at public companies in a
business similar to the business of SpinCo.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

4.

  |  

Immediately following the Merger, SpinCo shall retain Charter to provide the
services set forth on Annex 1, under the overall authority and supervision of
the SpinCo Board and the SpinCo Executive Management team.

 ANNEX B: STEP-UP ANNEX

  


 

  

* Payments under this annex to be calculated on an iterative basis *

  


 

  

Charter shall pay to Comcast:

  


 

  

(A) Annually, upon filing its tax return for each of the first eight taxable
years (or portions thereof) ending following the closing, the amount of the
Tax Benefit in such taxable year; and

  


 

  

(B) Upon filing its tax return for the eighth taxable year following the
closing (the "Final Year"), the present value, using the Discount Rate, of the
Tax Benefit for each subsequent taxable year of Charter (until the year in
which the Tax Benefit equals zero) using the Valuation Assumption.

  


 

  

"Tax Benefit" shall mean, for a taxable year, the reduction in the liability
for federal and state income taxes of Charter resulting from the amortization
and depreciation deductions, or , during the period described in clause (A)
above, reduction of taxable gain, attributable to the Basis Step Up,
calculated on a with and without basis.

  


 

  

"Basis Step Up" shall mean the amount of gain recognized by Comcast in the
Taxable Purchase (other than in respect of any interest in an entity treated
as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), increased by the
amounts paid pursuant to (A) and the amount to be paid pursuant to (B) above,
provided that the Basis Step Up shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the Final Allocation.

  


 

  

"Discount Rate" shall mean 10.00%.

  


 

  

"Valuation Assumption" shall mean the assumption that (i) in the Final Year,
Charter has generated an amount of taxable income that is sufficient to use
any net operating losses resulting in the first eight taxable years from
amortization and depreciation deductions attributable to the Basis Step Up but
not giving rise to a payment for a Tax Benefit and (ii) in each taxable year
following the Final Year, Charter will generate an amount of taxable income
that is sufficient to use any amortization and depreciation deductions
attributable to any remaining Basis Step Up.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

ANNEX C: ARBITRATION ANNEX 
 

  

  

The arbitration tribunal will be composed of three disinterested arbitrators,
appointed pursuant to the following procedure: within 5 days of submission of
the unresolved controversy to arbitration, each party will notify the other
party of its arbitrator. If either party fails to notify the other party of
its arbitrator within such 5-day period, appointment of such party's
arbitrator will be made by the American Arbitration Association upon request
of such other party. The arbitrators so appointed will choose a third
arbitrator, who will serve as president of the tribunal thus composed. If the
arbitrators fail to agree upon the choice of a third arbitrator within 5 days
from the appointment of the second arbitrator, the third arbitrator will be
appointed by the American Arbitration Association upon the request of the
arbitrators or either of the parties. Each arbitrator will be selected from
the American Arbitration Association's National Roster, will possess relevant
expertise and will be independent of, and have no material relationship with,
either party.

  

  

In connection with any arbitration proceeding, each party will submit in
writing to the arbitrators (with a copy simultaneously delivered to the other
party) no later than 10 days after appointment of the third arbitrator, or
such later date to which the parties agree in writing, its proposed resolution
of the unresolved controversy, together with an explanation supporting its
proposal. If the arbitrators determine that additional information is
necessary, they will, by written notice to both parties, request such
information from one or both parties and establish a reasonable time period
(not to exceed 10 days) for the submission of such information (and each party
requested to provide information will deliver such information and any
associated response to the arbitrators and the other party at the same time).
The arbitrators will also have the right to request that the parties make oral
presentations regarding the unresolved controversy, in which case each party
will be afforded a full and equal opportunity to be heard.

  

  

The arbitrators will, based on the Term Sheet, the written submissions and
oral presentations described in the preceding paragraph and their own
independent expertise, make their determination as to the unresolved
controversy by majority decision. The decision will be made with a view toward
effecting the original intent of Charter and Comcast as closely as possible
and will take into account, to the extent necessary, customary market practice
for a transaction of the nature of the Transactions.

  

  

The arbitrators will make their determination as to the unresolved controversy
as promptly as possible, but in no event later than 30 days after the
submission of the parties' resolutions to the arbitrators, and Charter and
Comcast will cooperate and take all actions necessary to facilitate the
arbitrators' resolution of the unresolved controversy within this timeframe,
it being understood that, even if Charter or Comcast does not so cooperate,
the arbitrators will nonetheless be required to render their decision within
the 30 days' timeframe contemplated by this sentence. The arbitration decision
will be final and binding upon both parties, will not be subject to judicial
or other review. and will be reflected in the terms of the Long-Form
Agreements, which will then be executed and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

delivered by Charter and Comcast. The arbitrators will not have the power to
award money damages or exemplary or punitive damages, however denominated.

  

  

Each party will bear its own expenses in connection with any arbitration
proceeding. The remaining costs of the arbitration proceeding, including fees
of the arbitrators and administrative fees, will be borne equally by the
parties.

  

  

The seat of arbitration will be New York City.

Financing Expenses

   
---|---|--- 
  

1.

  |  

* Following entry into the binding term sheet, Charter will use reasonable best efforts to obtain committed financing for Charter to complete the Taxable Purchase (the "Charter Financing").

  |  

* Charter is responsible for financing expenses for the Charter Financing.

   
  

2.

  |  

o If, within the 30 day period following receipt of carveout financial
statements for the Taxable Purchase Assets and Comcast Swap Assets, Charter
believes in good faith that it will be unable to obtain the Charter Financing,
then Charter will have the right to terminate the Transactions at any time on
or prior to the fifth day following the end of such 30 day period.

  |   
  

3.

  |  

o If, within the 30 day period following receipt of carveout financial
statements for the Taxable Purchase Assets and Comcast Swap Assets, Charter
has not delivered financing commitments for the Charter Financing, then each
of Charter and Comcast will have the right to terminate the Transactions at
any time on or prior to the fifth day following the end of such 30 day period.

  |   
  

4.

  |  

* Promptly following satisfaction of all closing conditions to the Transactions (other than (x) conditions set forth in this Schedule 1 and (y) conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing), the banks will launch the Debt Tender and Comcast will cooperate therewith.

  |   
  

5.

  |  

o A reasonable period of time (but in no event more than 10 days) prior to the
anticipated launch of the Debt Tender, Comcast and Charter will, after
consultation with their respective financial advisors, mutually estimate the
Clearing Tender Price, the Maximum Tender Price, and the Leverage-Limited
Tender Price, as well as the Achievable SpinCo Leverage. If Comcast and
Charter are unable to agree, they will mutually select an independent third
investment bank to make the above determinations. The parties may also, by
mutual agreement, obtain a financing commitment for a principal amount of
SpinCo Securities that would result in the Achievable SpinCo Leverage.

  

  

o "Achievable SpinCo Leverage" means the Resulting SpinCo Leverage based on an
aggregate tender price equal to the lowest of the Clearing Tender Price,
Maximum Tender Price and Leverage-Limited Tender Price.

  

  

o "Resulting SpinCo Leverage" means the ratio of (i) the sum of (x) the
principal amount

  

  

  |  

* If the parties (or third investment bank) conclude that the Achievable SpinCo Leverage is less than 5.0x, each of Comcast and Charter shall have the right to fund additional tender premium at its own expense to increase the Achievable SpinCo Leverage (up to the lesser of 5.0x and the maximum Resulting SpinCo Leverage based on the SpinCo Securities that can be sold in the market, with Comcast and Charter prorated on the basis of the Comcast Percentage and the SpinCo Percentage, respectively, if both exercise this right and proration is

   
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

     |  

of new SpinCo debt that would be exchanged in a Debt-for-Debt Exchange for the
Comcast notes1 to be acquired in the Debt Tender and (y) an estimate by the
parties of the principal amount of Term Loans set forth below to (ii) SpinCo
EBITDA.2

  

  

o "Tender Expenses Cap" means a cap on the Tender Expenses to be agreed by the
parties.

  

  

o "Leverage-Limited Tender Price" means the lowest aggregate tender price that
would result in an amount of bonds acquired in the Debt-for-Debt Exchange with
a value (taking into account certain of the SpinCo Financing Expenses) equal
to the aggregate principal amount of not less than 8-year unsecured (5-year
non-call) securities and not less than 10-year secured (5-year non-call)
securities of SpinCo ("SpinCo Securities") that can be sold in the market.

  

  

o "Maximum Tender Price" means the aggregate tender price that would result in
Tender Expenses being equal to the Tender Expenses Cap.

  

  

o "Clearing Tender Price" means the lowest aggregate tender price that, taking
into account other SpinCo Tender Expenses, would be required to reach a
Resulting SpinCo Leverage of 5.0x.

  |  

necessary). In the event of such increase, the Maximum Tender Price will be
deemed to have been increased by the amount of such additional tender premium.

  

  

* "SpinCo Issuance Expenses" include:

  

  

o SpinCo note issuance costs (gross spread);

  

  

o revolver underwriting fee;

  

  

o any commitment or bridge fees arising from any financing commitment obtained
for SpinCo debt; and

  

  

o financing, legal and accounting expenses specific to debt financing
(excluding any costs of preparation and review of carveout financial
statements).

  

  

* "Tender Expenses" (together with the SpinCo Issuance Expenses, the "SpinCo Financing Expenses") include:

  

  

o tender offer Premium to Market (as defined below) of Comcast debt tender as
contemplated hereby (the "Debt Tender");

  

  

o additional tender offer and debt-for-debt exchange structuring costs;

  

  

o financing, legal and accounting expenses specific to the Debt Tender and the
Debt-for-Debt Exchange (excluding any costs of preparation and review of
carveout financial statements); and

o expenses of any third investment bank.

  

  

* All expenses will be calculated on a tax-effected basis.

   
---|---|--- 
  

6.

  |  

o Prior to launching the tender offer, Comcast and Charter will, to the extent
required by the financial institutions conducting the Debt Tender, certify to
the financial institutions conducting the Debt Tender that they do not know of
any reason why any closing conditions to the Transactions will not be
satisfied. Failure to provide the certification would not in itself give rise
to a termination right or any liability hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Comcast nor Charter will be required to waive any closing conditions
to the Transactions.

  |   
  

7.

  |  

o The launch date of the Debt Tender will be agreed by the parties, taking
into account market conditions and customary holidays and blackout periods. At
launch, except as otherwise agreed by the parties in good faith, the tender
price will be equal to the lesser of the estimated Clearing Tender Price and
the estimated Maximum Tender Price. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties
in good faith, The amount of Comcast notes sought in the Debt Tender will
equal the amount of notes required to reach the Achievable SpinCo Leverage.
Comcast and Charter will jointly determine which Comcast notes will be sought
in the Debt Tender, subject to reasonable liability management decisions by
Comcast.

  |   
  

8.

  |  

o The tender offer will have an early bird tender deadline of 10 business
days.

  |   
  

9.

  |  

§ If the Debt Tender is fully subscribed or oversubscribed at such time,
except as otherwise agreed by the parties in good faith, the Debt Tender will
be closed without any extension or repricing.

  |   
  

10.

  |  

§ If the Debt Tender is undersubscribed at the early bird tender deadline,
then if the tender price was less than the lesser of the estimated Maximum
Tender Price and estimated Leverage-Limited Tender Price, the parties (or
third investment bank) will produce new estimates of the Clearing Tender
Price, Maximum Tender Price and Leverage-Limited Tender Price and the Debt
Tender will be amended to extend the Debt Tender for another 10 business days
and to increase the tender price to the lesser of the new estimate of the
Clearing Tender Price, the Maximum Tender Price and the Leverage-Limited
Tender Price. The Debt Tender may not be extended more than twice in this
manner, i.e., the Debt Tender shall not be extended if such extension would
cause the Debt Tender to be open for more than 30 business days in the
aggregate.

  |  

* If the tender price was equal to the Maximum Tender Price, or the new estimate of the Clearing Tender Price exceeds the Maximum Tender Price, each of Comcast and Charter shall have the right to fund additional tender premium at its own expense to increase the expected Achievable SpinCo Leverage (up to the lesser of 5.0x and the maximum Resulting SpinCo Leverage based on the SpinCo Securities that can be sold in the market, with Comcast and Charter prorated on the basis of the Comcast Percentage and

   
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

     |  |  

the SpinCo Percentage, respectively, if both exercise this right and proration
is necessary). In the event of such increase, the Maximum Tender Price will be
deemed to have been increased by the amount of such additional tender premium.

   
---|---|--- 
  

11.

  |  

§ Prior to extending or settling the Debt Tender, Comcast and Charter will
again, to the extent required by the financial institutions conducting the
Debt Tender, certify to the financial institutions conducting the Debt Tender
that they do not know of any reason why any closing condition to the
Transactions will not be satisfied. Failure to provide the certification would
not in itself give rise to a termination right or to any liability hereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither Comcast nor Charter will be required to
waive any closing conditions to the Transactions.

  |   
  

12.

  |  

§ Following the expiry of any extension period pursuant to the second
preceding bullet, the Debt Tender will be closed, provided the Resulting
SpinCo Leverage would be at least 2.5x, without any further extension or
repricing.

  |   
  

13.

  |  

§ If the amount of notes tendered is less than the amount required to reach a
Resulting SpinCo Leverage of 2.5x, the Transactions will be terminated and the
tender will not settle.

  |  

* If the transactions are terminated in these circumstances, then SpinCo Financing Expenses are shared by Comcast and Charter in proportion to the Comcast Percentage and the SpinCo Percentage, respectively.

  

  

* The "Comcast Percentage" equals 100% less the SpinCo Percentage.

   
  

14.

  |  

* Following settlement of the Debt Tender, the banks will hold the tendered Comcast notes for 14 calendar days.

  |   
  

15.

  |  

* Comcast and Charter, after consultation with their financial advisors, will determine (or, if they are unable to agree, the independent third investment bank) the Premium to Market based on the tender price.

  

  

o "Premium to Market" means (i) total price to be paid in the Debt Tender less
(ii) Adjusted Market Value of the debt tendered.

  

  

* To determine "Adjusted Market Value", Comcast and Charter, after consultation with their financial advisors (or the third bank), will determine the Initial Comcast Credit Spreads, the Initial Reference Credit Spreads and the Launch Reference Bond Credit Spreads. Comcast and Charter (or the third bank) will then calculate, for each Maturity Range, the percentage change from the weighted average of the Initial Reference Credit Spreads in such Maturity Range to the

  

  

  |   
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

     |  

weighted average of the Launch Reference Credit Spreads in such Maturity
Range. These percentage changes will then be applied to the Initial Comcast
Credit Spread for each series of Comcast notes in the applicable Maturity
Range to determine (based on the adjusted credit spread and the yield to
maturity of the applicable U.S. Treasury obligation as of the day before the
launch of the Debt Tender) the Adjusted Market Value for such series of
Comcast notes.

  

  

o The "Reference Index" means an index agreed by the parties, for each
Maturity Range.

  

  

o The "Initial Comcast Credit Spreads" means the trailing 30-calendar day
average credit spread (calculated as the difference between the yield to
maturity of the applicable bond and the yield to maturity of the appropriate
U.S. Treasury obligation, and based on the last institutional size trade,
defined as $1,000,000 or more, as seen on the TRACE system at the end of each
trading day on which such a trade exists, but excluding accrued and unpaid
interest) as of April 17, 2014 for each series of Comcast bonds.

  

  

o The "Initial Reference Credit Spreads" means the trailing 30-calendar day
average credit spread for the Reference Index as of April 17, 2014 for each of
the Maturity Ranges.

  

  

o The "Launch Reference Credit Spreads" means the trailing 30-calendar day
average credit spread for the Reference Index as of the day before the launch
of the Debt Tender for each of the Maturity Ranges.

  

  

o The "Maturity Ranges" mean maturity of (i) up to and including 2019, (ii)
2020 through 2024, and (iii) after 2024.

  

  

From the date hereof through the launch date of the Debt Tender, Comcast shall
not permit any repurchases, repayments, amendments or modifications of any
Comcast notes other than, in each case in the ordinary course and in good
faith.

  |   
---|---|--- 
  

16.

  |  

* On the fifth day following the settlement of the tender, SpinCo notes will be priced in the market on a best-efforts basis (unless the parties otherwise agree), in a principal amount (less original issue discount, if any) equal to the value of Comcast notes tendered in the Debt Tender (equal to the price at which Comcast notes will be purchased from the banks pursuant to the exchange agreement plus certain SpinCo Financing Expenses), and Comcast will enter into the exchange agreement (and the terms and price of the exchange will be fixed), with completion of the exchange conditioned upon the completion of the Transactions and completion of the Transactions conditioned upon completion of the exchange. On the 14th day, the priced SpinCo notes will be issued and the debt-for-debt exchange will be settled.

  |  

* If the Transactions are consummated, the SpinCo Financing Expenses will be borne by SpinCo, and the Comcast Percentage of any SpinCo Financing Expenses previously incurred by Comcast will be reimbursed to Comcast by SpinCo.

  

  

* With respect to any SpinCo Financing Expenses for which SpinCo reimburses Comcast, SpinCo will distribute to Comcast up to an amount less than the estimated SpinCo basis (in each case, as determined by Comcast), and thereafter Charter will increase the Merger Consideration in the manner contemplated in the agreement under

   
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

     |  |  

"Transaction Steps".

  

  

* To the extent cancellation of indebtedness income (i) is known only after the Spin-Off or (ii) is known at the time of the Spin-Off and Comcast so elects, Charter will pay to Comcast in cash the SpinCo Percentage of any tax costs to Comcast for cancellation of indebtedness income arising from the Debt-for-Debt Exchange. To the extent cancellation of indebtedness income is known at the time of the Spin-Off and Comcast does not elect to have such tax costs paid in cash, such tax costs will be treated as SpinCo Financing Expenses.

   
---|---|--- 
  

17.

  |  

* SpinCo will also enter into term loans ("Term Loans") for an amount approximately equal to excess SpinCo basis and a revolving credit facility in an amount equal to $750,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by the parties).

  |   
  

18.

  |  

* If the Resulting SpinCo Leverage is less than 5.0x, then if Comcast and Charter agree, they shall cause SpinCo to do one or more of the following:

  

  

o borrow funds and distribute cash up to excess SpinCo basis (if any) to
Comcast;

  

  

o borrow funds and distribute cash up to EandP to SpinCo shareholders;

  

  

o distribute SpinCo Securities to Comcast shareholders up to Comcast EandP; or

  

  

o distribute excess cash to Comcast.

  

  

in each case, in a manner that would not cause aggregate SpinCo Indebtedness
to exceed 5.0x SpinCo EBITDA.

  

  

* Expenses incurred in connection with the above options will constitute SpinCo Financing Expenses.

  

  

* If Comcast and Charter do not elect one or more of the above options in an amount that would cause Resulting SpinCo Leverage to equal 5.0x SpinCo EBITDA, Charter will increase the Merger Consideration as contemplated by the Agreement.

  |  

* If the Transactions are terminated as a result of (1) a party's breach, (2) a "Material Adverse Effect" on a party or (3) a party's refusal to accept a Charter/Comcast Burdensome Condition, then that party is responsible for SpinCo Financing Expenses incurred prior to termination.

  

  

* If the Transactions are terminated because Charter shareholders do not approve the transactions, then Charter is responsible for SpinCo Financing Expenses incurred prior to termination;

  

  

* If the Transactions are terminated because the Comcast-TWC transaction is not completed, then Comcast is responsible for SpinCo Financing Expenses incurred prior to termination.

  

  

If the Transactions are terminated for any other reason, then, except as
otherwise

     |  |  

provided in this Schedule 1, SpinCo Financing Expenses are shared by Comcast
and Charter in proportion to the Comcast Percentage and the SpinCo Percentage,
respectively.

19.

  |  

* After settlement of the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the Spin-Off will occur.
