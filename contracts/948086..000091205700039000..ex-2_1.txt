PepsiAmericas, Inc."   (b) Subject to SECTION 7.6(B), the by-laws of Merger
Sub as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-
laws of the  Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with the
terms  thereof, of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation  and of the DGCL.   SECTION 2.5. DIRECTORS. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.   SECTION 2.6. OFFICERS. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.  
8   ARTICLE III  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB
AND THE  COMPANY; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION 3.1. EFFECT OF THE
MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any capital stock of the
Company or Merger Sub:   (a) SHARES OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. Each share
of common stock, par value  $.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding, unchanged by reason  of the Merger, as one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock,  par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN COMPANY COMMON STOCK.
Each Company Common Share  that is held in the treasury of the Company or
that is owned by Parent or  any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries shall be
canceled and shall cease to  exist, and no capital stock of Parent or other
consideration shall be  delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) CONVERSION OF
COMPANY COMMON SHARES OWNED BY PUBLIC. Subject to the  provisions of this
SECTION 3.1, each Company Common Share issued and  outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than  Dissenting Shares, shares canceled
pursuant to SECTION 3.1(B) and shares  held by Dakota Holdings or Pohlad
Companies (which shares shall be  converted solely as provided in Section
3.1(c)(iii)), shall be converted  into the right to receive:   (i) subject
to SECTION 3.1(E), an amount in cash equal to the Exchange  Ratio MULTIPLIED
BY the Parent Closing Price (the "CASH  CONSIDERATION"); or   (ii) the
number of Parent Common Shares (together with the associated  Rights) equal
to the Exchange Ratio (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION"); or   (iii) (A) the number
of Parent Common Shares (together with the  associated Rights) equal to the
Fixed Earnout Exchange Ratio PLUS  (B) the right to receive the Contingent
Payments described in  ARTICLE IV (the "CONTINGENT PAYMENT CONSIDERATION" and
together  with the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, the 
"MERGER CONSIDERATION").   For purposes of clarity, each record holder of
Company Common Shares entitled to make an Election pursuant to this SECTION
3.1 may make a Cash Election, Stock Election or Contingent Payment Election,
or any combination thereof, with respect to the Company Common Shares owned
by such record holder, PROVIDED, that the sum of all Elections made by such
record holder equals 100% of such record holder\'s Company Common Shares and
that each Election is for a whole number of Company Common Shares and not a
fractional share.   (d) CASH ELECTION. Subject to the provisions of this
SECTION 3.1(D) and  SECTION 3.1(E), each record holder of Company Common
Shares immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than Dakota Holdings
and Pohlad  Companies) shall be entitled to elect to receive the Cash
Consideration  (a "CASH ELECTION") for all or any part of such holder\'s
Company Common  Shares (each, a "CASH ELECTION SHARE"). Cash Elections shall
be made on a  form designed for that purpose, which shall include a letter
of  transmittal (a "FORM OF ELECTION"). A holder of record of Company
Common  Shares who holds such Company Common Shares as nominee, trustee or
in  another representative capacity (a "SHARES REPRESENTATIVE") may submit 
multiple Forms of Election; provided that such Shares Representative 
certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the Company Common 
Shares held by such Shares Representative for each particular beneficial 
owner whose Company Common Shares are covered by such Form of Election. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate number of Company Common 
Shares   9   that may be converted in the Merger into the right to receive
Cash  Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole share, the "CASH 
ELECTION NUMBER") shall not exceed the lesser of:   (i) a number equal to
(A) the product of 50% MULTIPLIED BY the total  number of Company Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time MINUS
(B) the number of Dissenting  Shares; and   (ii) the number which would
cause the ratio of the value of the  aggregate Stock Consideration to be
issued in the Merger to the  value of the aggregate Merger Consideration to
be less than 0.50  (assuming, for these purposes, that no Contingent Payments
will be  made), such ratio to be equal to a fraction, the numerator of
which  is equal to (A) the per share closing price of the Parent Common 
Shares, as reported in the NYSE Composite Transactions, on the  Closing Date
MULTIPLIED BY the aggregate number of Parent Common  Shares to be paid as
Merger Consideration pursuant to SECTION 3.1  (assuming, for these purposes,
that no Contingent Payments will be  made), and the denominator of which is
equal to (B) the sum of  (1) the amount set forth in the preceding clause (A)
PLUS (2) the  aggregate Cash Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section
3.1  PLUS (3) the number of Dissenting Shares MULTIPLIED BY the greater  of
the Cash Consideration or $3.80 PLUS (4) any other amounts paid  by Parent or
the Company (or any affiliate thereof) to, or on  behalf of, any stockholder
of the Company in connection with the  sale, redemption or other disposition
of any Company stock in  connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury
Regulation  Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e) PLUS (5) any extraordinary 
dividend distributed by the Company prior to and in connection with  the
Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e)  and
1.368-1T(e).   (e) PRORATION OF COMPANY COMMON SHARES. If the aggregate
number of Company  Common Shares in respect of which Cash Elections have been
made exceeds  the Cash Election Number, each Cash Election Share shall be
converted  into (i) the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal  to the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction (the 
"CASH FRACTION"), the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election  Number
and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash  Election
Shares, and (ii) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the  product of
(A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one MINUS  the Cash
Fraction.   (f) STOCK ELECTION. Each record holder of Company Common Shares
immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than Dakota Holdings and
Pohlad  Companies) shall be entitled to elect to receive Parent Common
Shares  (together with the associated Rights) for all or any part of such 
holder\'s Company Common Shares (a "STOCK ELECTION"). Stock Elections  shall
be made on a Form of Election. A Shares Representative may submit  multiple
Forms of Election; PROVIDED that such Shares Representative  certifies that
each such Form of Election covers all the Company Common  Shares held by such
Shares Representatives for each beneficial owner  whose Company Common Shares
are covered by such Form of Election.   (g) CONTINGENT PAYMENT ELECTION.
Each record holder of Company Common Shares  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to  receive the Contingent Payment
Consideration for all or any part of such  holder\'s Company Common Shares (a
"CONTINGENT PAYMENT ELECTION" and,  collectively with the Stock Election and
the Cash Election, an  "ELECTION"). Contingent Payment Elections shall be
made on a Form of  Election. A Shares Representative may submit multiple
Forms of Election;  PROVIDED, that such Shares Representative certifies that
each such Form  of Election covers all the Company Common Shares held by such
Shares  Representative for each beneficial owner whose Company Common Shares
are  covered by such Form of Election.   10   (h) FORM OF ELECTION. To be
effective, a Form of Election must be properly  completed, signed and
submitted to the Exchange Agent and accompanied by  the certificates
representing the Company Common Shares ("COMPANY COMMON  CERTIFICATES") as to
which the Election is being made (or by an  appropriate guarantee of delivery
of such Company Common Certificate  signed by a firm that is a member of any
registered national securities  exchange or a member of the National
Association of Securities  Dealers, Inc. or a bank, broker, dealer, credit
union, savings  association or other entity that is a member in good standing
of the  Securities Transfer Agent\'s Medallion Program, the NYSE Medallion 
Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program). All 
Company Common Certificates so surrendered shall be subject to the  exchange
procedures set forth in SECTION 3.2(B). Parent shall have the  discretion,
which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange  Agent, to
determine whether Forms of Election have been properly  completed, signed and
submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial  defects in Forms of
Election. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange  Agent) in such matters
shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent  nor the Exchange Agent shall
be under any obligation to notify any person  of any defect in a Form of
Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. The  Exchange Agent shall also make
all computations contemplated by this  SECTION 3.1, and all such computations
shall be conclusive and binding on  the holders of Company Common Shares.  
(i) DEEMED NON-ELECTION. For the purposes hereof, a holder of Company Common 
Shares who does not submit a Form of Election that is received by the 
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline (the "NO ELECTION SHARES") 
shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election. If Parent or the Exchange 
Agent shall determine that any purported Election was not properly made,  the
shares subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as  No
Election Shares.   (j) ELECTION DEADLINE. Parent and the Company shall each
use its reasonable  best efforts to cause copies of the Form of Election to
be mailed to  record holders of Company Common Shares not less than thirty
(30) days  prior to the Effective Time and to make the Form of Election
available to  all Persons who become record holders of Company Common Shares
during the  period between the date of such mailing and the Effective Time. A
Form of  Election must be received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New
York  City time, on the tenth business day after the Effective Time (the 
"ELECTION DEADLINE") in order to be effective. A record holder may revoke 
his Election by written notice received at or prior to the Election 
Deadline. Any Election relating to Company Common Shares which become 
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed automatically revoked as of the  Election
Deadline.   (k) ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS. In the event Parent (i) changes
(or  establishes a record date for changing) the number of Parent Common 
Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of  a
stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization, 
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction with respect to  the
outstanding Parent Common Shares or (ii) pays or makes an  extraordinary
dividend or distribution in respect of Parent Common Shares  (other than a
distribution referred to in clause (i) of this sentence)  and, in either
case, the record date therefor shall be prior to the  Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration and Subscription Shares shall be  proportionately
adjusted. Regular periodic cash dividends and increases  thereon consistent
with past practices shall not be considered  extraordinary for purposes of
the preceding sentence.   (l) DISSENTING SHARES. To the extent that holders
thereof are entitled to  appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL,
Company Common Shares  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held  by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected
his demand for  appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares")  shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration, but the holders of   11   Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive from the Company such  consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;  provided, however, that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect  or shall effectively withdraw
or lose his right to appraisal and payment  under the DGCL, such holder\'s
Company Common Shares shall thereupon be  deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to  receive the Cash Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and such  shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares.   (m) MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PARENT COMMON SHARES. The maximum number of
Parent  Common Shares that may be issued in connection with the Merger shall
be  specified in a certificate mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company 
and delivered at the Closing. Such certificate, as so delivered, shall be 
deemed to form a part of this Agreement.   SECTION 3.2. Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) DEPOSIT WITH EXCHANGE AGENT. Within five business days
after the  Election Deadline, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with a
bank or  trust company mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the
"EXCHANGE  AGENT"), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably  acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount of cash and
certificates  representing Parent Common Shares required to effect the
conversion of  Company Common Shares into Parent Common Shares and cash in
accordance  with SECTIONS 3.1(C)(I), 3.1(C)(II) AND 3.1(C)(III)(A).   (b)
EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable (but  not
more than 15 days) after the Election Deadline, Parent shall cause  the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Common 
Certificate representing Company Common Shares who did not make a valid 
Election pursuant to SECTION 3.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which  shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title  to the
Company Common Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery  of the
Company Common Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and  (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Company Common  Certificates and receiving the
Merger Consideration to which such holder  shall be entitled pursuant to
SECTION 3.1. Upon surrender of a Company  Common Certificate to the Exchange
Agent for cancellation, together with  a duly executed letter of transmittal
and such other documents as the  Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the
holder of such Company Common  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) a  certificate representing that number of whole Parent
Common Shares into  which the Company Common Shares previously represented by
such Company  Common Certificate have been converted in accordance with 
SECTION 3.1(C)(II) or 3.1(C)(III)(A) or (B) the cash to which such holder  is
entitled in accordance with SECTION 3.1(C)(I) and (C) the cash in lieu  of
fractional Parent Common Shares to which such holder has the right to 
receive pursuant to SECTION 3.2(D), and the Company Common Certificate so 
surrendered shall be canceled. In the event the Merger Consideration is  to
be delivered to any Person other than the Person in whose name the  Company
Common Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered  in the
transfer records of Company, the Merger Consideration may be  delivered to a
transferee if the Company Common Certificate is presented  to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence  and effect such
transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange  Agent that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until  surrendered as
contemplated by this SECTION 3.2(B), each Company Common  Certificate (other
than a Company Common Certificate representing Company  Common Shares to be
canceled in accordance with SECTION 3.1(B) or  Dissenting Shares) shall, at
and after the Effective Time, be deemed to  represent only the right to
receive, upon such surrender, the Merger  Consideration contemplated by this
SECTION 3.2(B). No interest will be  paid or will accrue on any cash  
12   payable to holders of Company Common Certificates pursuant to the 
provisions of this ARTICLE III.   (c) DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO
UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other  distributions that are declared or
made on or after the Effective Time  with respect to Parent Common Shares or
that are payable to holders of  record thereof on or after the Effective Time
shall be paid to any Person  entitled by reason of the Merger to receive
certificates representing  Parent Common Shares, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares  shall be paid to any such Person pursuant to SECTION
3.2(D), until such  Person shall surrender his Company Common Certificates as
provided in  SECTION 3.2(B). Subject to the effect of unclaimed property,
escheat and  other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Company
Common  Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates  representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor,  without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any  cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent Common Share to which such 
holder is entitled pursuant to SECTION 3.2(D) and the amount of dividends  or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time  theretofore
paid with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares and  (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other  distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to  surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect  to such whole
Parent Common Shares.   (d) NO FRACTIONAL SECURITIES. In lieu of any such
fractional securities,  each holder of Company Common Shares who would
otherwise have been  entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share upon
surrender of Company  Common Certificates for exchange pursuant to this
ARTICLE III will be  paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such
holder\'s  proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales
in the  open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of
the  aggregate fractional Parent Common Shares issued pursuant to this 
ARTICLE III. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the 
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole  Parent
Common Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over  (ii) the
aggregate number of whole Parent Common Shares to be distributed  to holders
of Company Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(b) (such  excess being
herein called the "EXCESS PARENT COMMON SHARES"). The  Exchange Agent, as
agent for the former holders of Company Common Shares,  shall sell the Excess
Parent Common Shares at the prevailing prices on  the NYSE. The sales of the
Excess Parent Common Shares by the Exchange  Agent shall be executed on the
NYSE through one or more member firms of  the NYSE and shall be executed in
round lots to the extent practicable.  Parent shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket  transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the  Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
such sale of Excess Parent  Common Shares. Until the net proceeds of such
sale have been distributed  to the former holders of Company Common Shares,
the Exchange Agent will  hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders.
As soon as  practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be
paid to  former holders of Company Common Shares in lieu of any fractional 
interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly distribute or cause to be 
distributed such amounts to such former holders.   (e) TERMINATION OF
EXCHANGE AGENT. Any certificates representing Parent  Common Shares deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to  SECTION 3.2(A)and not exchanged within
one year after the Effective Time  pursuant this SECTION 3.2 shall be
returned by the Exchange Agent to  Parent, which shall thereafter act as
Exchange Agent. All funds held by  the Exchange Agent for payment to the
holders of unsurrendered Company  Common Certificates and unclaimed at the
end of one year from the  Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after
which time any holder  of unsurrendered Company Common Certificates shall
look as a general  creditor only   13   to Parent for payment of such
funds to which such holder may be due,  subject to applicable Law.  
SECTION 3.3. OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.   (a) Each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "COMPANY  OPTION") issued by the Company
pursuant to any stock option or similar  plan of the Company or pursuant to
an option agreement or otherwise as  set forth in SECTION 5.3 of the Company
Disclosure Statement, which is  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of  the Merger and without any further action
on the part of any holder  thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into
an option (a "PARENT  OPTION") to purchase that number of Parent Common
Shares determined by  multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject
to such Company  Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, at  an exercise price per Parent Common Share equal to the
exercise price per  share of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time  DIVIDED BY the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole cent. If  the foregoing calculation results in an assumed Company
Option being  exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common Share, then the
number of  Parent Common Shares subject to such option shall be rounded up to
the  nearest whole number of shares, with no cash being payable for such 
fractional share. The terms and conditions of each Parent Option shall 
otherwise remain as set forth in the Company Option converted into such 
Parent Option.   (b) Each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a  "COMPANY WARRANT") set forth in SECTION 5.3 of the Company
Disclosure  Statement, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time  shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part  of any holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a
warrant  (a "Parent Warrant") to purchase that number of Parent Common
Shares  determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject
to  such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time by the 
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per Parent Common Share equal to the 
exercise price per share of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the 
Effective Time DIVIDED BY the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest 
whole cent. If the foregoing calculation results in an assumed Company 
Warrant being exercisable for a fraction of a Parent Common Share, then  the
number of Parent Common Shares subject to such warrant shall be  rounded up
to the nearest whole number of shares, with no cash being  payable for such
fractional share. The terms and conditions of each  Parent Warrant shall
otherwise remain as set forth in the Company Warrant  converted into such
Parent Warrant.   (c) The adjustment provided in SECTION 3.3(A) with respect
to any options  which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section
422 of the  Code) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which
is  consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.   SECTION 3.4. TRANSFER OF
SHARES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME. No transfers of Company Common Shares shall
be made on the stock transfer books of the Company after the close of
business on the day prior to the date of the Effective Time.   SECTION 3.5.
ESCHEAT. The Company shall not be liable to any Person for shares or funds
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.   14   ARTICLE IV CONTINGENT PAYMENTS 
CONTINGENT PAYMENTS   A record holder of Company Common Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time who properly makes a Contingent Payment Election
in accordance with SECTION 3.1 (a "CONTINGENT PAYMENT RECORD HOLDER") shall
have the following contractual right to receive additional Parent Common
Shares, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein:   SECTION
4.1. TARGET PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.   (a) 2001 ADJUSTED EBITDA. If 2001
Adjusted EBITDA exceeds $68.9 million,  each Contingent Payment Record Holder
shall be entitled to receive, on  the Contingent Share Delivery Date with
respect to the Measurement Period  for the fiscal year period consisting of
52 or 53 weeks ending on the  Saturday closest to December 31, 2001, with
respect to each Company  Common Share deemed to be held by such Contingent
Payment Record Holder  in respect of which a Contingent Payment Election has
been made, the  number of Parent Common Shares (together with the associated
Rights)  equal to (i) the Contingent Earnout Exchange Ratio MULTIPLIED BY 
(ii) the lesser of (A) 1 or (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
amount by which 2001 Adjusted EBITDA exceeds $68.9 million, and the 
denominator of which is $7.7 million (the "2001 CONTINGENT PAYMENT").   (b)
2002 ADJUSTED EBITDA. If 2002 Adjusted EBITDA exceeds $84 million, each 
Contingent Payment Record Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the 
Contingent Share Delivery Date with respect to the Measurement Period for 
the fiscal year period consisting of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the  Saturday
closest to December 31, 2002, with respect to each Company  Common Share
deemed to be held by such Contingent Payment Record Holder  in respect of
which a Contingent Payment Election has been made, the  number of Parent
Common Shares (together with the associated Rights)  equal to (i) the
Contingent Earnout Exchange Ratio MULTIPLIED BY  (ii) the lesser of (A) 1 or
(B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the  amount by which 2002 Adjusted
EBITDA exceeds $84 million, and the  denominator of which is $9.3 million
(the "2002 CONTINGENT PAYMENT").   (c) AGGREGATE ADJUSTED EBITDA. If
Aggregate Adjusted EBITDA exceeds  $235.5 million, each Contingent Payment
Record Holder shall be entitled  to receive, on the Contingent Share Delivery
Date with respect to the  Measurement Period for the three-year period
beginning January 2, 2000  and ending on the Saturday closest to December 31,
2002, with respect to  each Company Common Share deemed to be held by such
Contingent Payment  Record Holder and in respect of which a Contingent
Payment Election has  been made, the number of Parent Common Shares (together
with the  associated Rights) equal to (i) the Contingent Earnout Exchange
Ratio  MULTIPLIED BY (ii) the lesser of (A) 1 or (B) a fraction, the
numerator  of which is the amount by which Aggregate Adjusted EBITDA
exceeds  $235.5 million, and the denominator of which is $11.8 million (the 
"Aggregate Contingent Payment" and together with the 2001 Contingent  Payment
and the 2002 Contingent Payment, the "CONTINGENT PAYMENTS").   SECTION 4.2.
DETERMINATION OF CONTINGENT PAYMENTS.   (a) The Independent Auditors shall
be engaged by the Affiliated Transaction  Committee to determine Adjusted
EBITDA for any applicable period, as well  as 2001 Adjusted EBITDA, 2002
Adjusted EBITDA and Aggregate Adjusted  EBITDA, as the case may be, within 75
days after the applicable  Measurement Period. After each Measurement Period,
but not later than  thirty (30) days following the completion of Parent\'s
annual year-end  audit, the Independent Auditors shall prepare and deliver to
the  Affiliated Transaction Committee (with a copy to Robert Pohlad on
behalf  of the Contingent Payment Record Holders) a report (a "PRELIMINARY 
CONTINGENT PAYMENT REPORT") setting forth the Independent Auditors\' 
determination of the   15   Adjusted EBITDA for any applicable period, as
well as 2001 Adjusted  EBITDA, 2002 Adjusted EBITDA and Aggregate Adjusted
EBITDA, as the case  may be. Within ten (10) days after the Independent
Auditors shall have  delivered the Preliminary Contingent Payment Report to
the Affiliated  Transaction Committee and Robert Pohlad, Robert Pohlad, on
behalf of the  Contingent Payment Record Holders, shall submit in writing to
the  Affiliated Transaction Committee any objections thereto that he may
have.  If Robert Pohlad does not submit in writing any such objections
within  such 10-day period, it shall be conclusively presumed that Robert
Pohlad,  on behalf of the Contingent Payment Record Holders, does not object
to  the Preliminary Contingent Payment Report.   (b) As soon as practicable
after receiving the written objections, if any,  from Robert Pohlad, on
behalf of the Contingent Payment Record Holders,  but in no event more than
25 days after the Independent Auditors shall  have delivered the Preliminary
Contingent Payment Report to the  Affiliated Transaction Committee and Robert
Pohlad, the Affiliated  Transaction Committee shall review the same and any
written objections  thereto received from Robert Pohlad as contemplated by
SECTION 4.2(A) and  shall determine whether it finds the Preliminary
Contingent Payment  Report to be reasonable. If the Affiliated Transaction
Committee finds  the Preliminary Contingent Payment Report to be reasonable,
the  determinations set forth therein shall be final and binding on all 
parties, including, without limitation, Parent and each of the Contingent 
Payment Record Holders.   (c) If the Affiliated Transaction Committee does
not find the Preliminary  Contingent Payment Report to be reasonable, it
shall submit in writing to  the Independent Auditors within such 25-day
period its objections  thereto. The Independent Auditors and the Affiliated
Transaction  Committee shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve by
written  agreement (the "AGREED ADJUSTMENTS") any differences as to the 
determinations set forth in the Preliminary Contingent Payment Report,  and,
if the Independent Auditors and the Affiliated Transaction Committee  so
resolve any such differences, the determinations set forth in the 
Preliminary Contingent Payment Report as adjusted by the Agreed  Adjustments
shall be final and binding on all parties, including, without  limitation,
Parent and each of the Contingent Payment Record Holders.   (d) If any
objections raised by the Affiliated Transaction Committee are not  resolved
by Agreed Adjustments within the 10-day period next following  such 25-day
period, then the Independent Auditors and the Affiliated  Transaction
Committee shall submit the objections that are then  unresolved to the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be directed  by the Independent
Auditors and the Affiliated Transaction Committee to  seek to resolve the
unresolved objections as promptly as reasonably  practicable and to deliver
written notice to each of the Independent  Auditors and the Affiliated
Transaction Committee setting forth its  resolution of the unresolved
objections. The determinations set forth in  the Preliminary Contingent
Payment Report, as adjusted by the Agreed  Adjustments and by Accounting
Firm\'s resolution of the unresolved  objections, shall be final and binding
on all parties, including, without  limitation, Parent and each of the
Contingent Payment Record Holders. All  objections shall be resolved no later
than 45 days after the 10-day  period.   (e) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall make available to the  Independent Auditors and the
Affiliated Transaction Committee (and its  respective representatives) and,
if applicable, the Accounting Firm, such  books, records and other
information as any of the foregoing may  reasonably request to prepare or
review any Preliminary Contingent  Payment Report, the Agreed Adjustments or
any matters submitted to the  Accounting Firm.   (f) The fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by Parent.   16   SECTION 4.3.
DELIVERY OF CONTINGENT PAYMENT SHARES.   (a) On each Contingent Share
Delivery Date or as soon as practicable  thereafter, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent in trust for the  Contingent Payment Record Holders
certificates representing the total  Contingent Payments, if any, to be paid
on such Contingent Share Delivery  Date pursuant to this ARTICLE IV.   (b)
On each Contingent Share Delivery Date, each Contingent Payment Record 
Holder shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each Company Common 
Share deemed to be held by such Contingent Payment Record Holder in  respect
of which a Contingent Payment Election has been made, the  Contingent
Payments for the applicable Measurement Period.   (c) In the event Parent

recapitalization, reclassification,  reorganization or similar transaction
with respect to the outstanding  Parent Common Shares or (ii) pays or makes
an extraordinary dividend or  distribution in respect of Parent Common Shares

in either  case, the record date therefor shall be after a Contingent Share
Earned  Date but prior to a Contingent Share Delivery Date, the Contingent 
Payments determined in accordance with SECTION 4.1 shall be  proportionately
adjusted. Regular periodic cash dividends and increases  thereon consistent
with past practices shall not be considered  extraordinary for purposes of
the preceding sentence.   (d) Unless and until certificates representing the
Contingent Payments shall  be delivered to the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the Contingent  Payment Record Holders pursuant to SECTION 4.3(A), no
dividends payable  to holders of record of Parent Common Shares shall be paid

Record Holders shall provide to the  Exchange Agent by written notice. No
fractional Parent Common Shares  shall be issued or delivered pursuant to
this ARTICLE IV. In lieu of any  such fractional securities, each Contingent

an amount in cash  (without interest) equal to (i) the fraction of a Parent
Common Share to  which such Contingent Payment Record Holder would otherwise

consistent with the terms of this Agreement, as the Affiliated  Transaction
Committee may deem necessary or appropriate, including  without limitation,
as contemplated by the definition of Adjusted EBITDA  in SECTION 4.8. The
Affiliated Transaction Committee (i) shall have no   17   duties or
responsibilities except as expressly set forth herein or in the  by-laws of
Parent, (ii) shall not be responsible in its capacity as the  Affiliated
Transaction Committee for any recitals, statements,  representations or
warranties contained herein, or in any certificate or  other document
referred to herein, the validity, effectiveness or  enforceability of this
Agreement, the failure of the Surviving  Corporation to achieve any targets
or the failure of any party to perform  any of its obligations hereunder,
(iii) shall not be required to initiate  or conduct any litigation or
collection proceedings and (iv) shall not be  responsible for any action
taken or omitted to be taken hereunder, except  for, in the case of any

legal counsel, independent public  accountants and other experts selected by
it, and shall not be liable for  any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by it in accordance  with the advice of such counsel, independent
public accountants or  experts. No act or omission of the Affiliated
Transaction Committee,  whether as a result of gross negligence, willful
misconduct or otherwise,  shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its
obligations under this  Agreement.   (b) The Affiliated Transaction
Committee shall be entitled to rely upon any  certification, notice or other
communication believed by it to be genuine  and correct and to have been
signed by or sent on behalf of the proper  Person or Persons and delivered in
accordance with this Agreement. The  Affiliated Transaction Committee shall
not be required to take any action  which shall expose the members thereof to
personal liability or which is  contrary to this Agreement or applicable
Law.   (c) The Affiliated Transaction Committee shall not be deemed to
have  knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any event unless it shall
have  received written notice thereof in accordance with this Agreement.  
(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on any 
and all action taken by the Affiliated Transaction Committee under this 
Agreement without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of  the
Contingent Payment Record Holders, and shall be entitled to rely on  any
written action purporting on its face to be an action of the  Affiliated
Transaction Committee and signed by any two members of the  Affiliated
Transaction Committee as an action of the Affiliated  Transaction
Committee.   SECTION 4.5. ASSIGNABILITY; ORDINARY COURSE. The right of each
Contingent Payment Record Holder to receive Parent Common Shares pursuant to
Article IV of this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred in any manner
whatsoever prior to the delivery of certificates representing the Contingent
Payments, except by operation of law. In no event shall any right to

other provision of this Agreement, no later than four years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall transfer to the Exchange Agent in trust for the

Record Holder shall have the right, on or prior  to the Election Deadline, to
elect to purchase from Parent, as more fully  set forth below, up to that
number of Subscription Shares, rounded down  to the nearest whole share,
equal to the number of Company Common Shares  in respect of which such
Contingent Payment Record Holder has made a  Contingent Payment Election
MULTIPLIED BY the Subscription Share Purchase  Rate, at a   18   price
per share equal to the Parent Reference Price. The Exchange Agent  shall
notify Dakota Holdings within five business days after the Election  Deadline
of the number of Subscription Shares not purchased by the other  Contingent
Payment Record Holders. Dakota Holdings shall be entitled to  purchase,
within ten (10) days after delivery of such notice, any  Subscription Shares
not purchased by the other Contingent Payment Record  Holders, at a price per
share equal to the Parent Reference Price.   (b) The Form of Election shall
be designed to allow holders of Company  Common Shares who make Contingent

Directors of the Company has duly adopted resolutions approving this
Agreement, the Parent Stockholder Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, determining that the
terms of the Merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company\'s stockholders, and recommending that the Company\'s
stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Parent Stockholder Voting Agreement and, subject to the approval and adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding Company Common Shares (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"),
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Parent Stockholder Voting Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and of the other

Agreement or the Parent Stockholder Voting Agreement or to consummate the

principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).   (b) The Company has taken all appropriate
actions so as to render the restrictions on business combinations contained
in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Company
Stockholder Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and

and the DGCL, none of the execution, delivery or performance of

"GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"); (c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to
any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, Permit, concession, franchise, license,
contract, agreement or other instrument, arrangement, understanding or
obligation (each a "CONTRACT") to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound; or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, except, in the case
of clauses (b), (c) or (d), for failures to obtain Authorizations,
violations, breaches or defaults that would not,   22  individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger.   SECTION 5.6. SEC REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has
timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act since January 1, 1998 (collectively, the "COMPANY SEC
REPORTS"). The Company SEC Reports (i) as of their respective dates, were
prepared in accordance with, and complied as to form in all material respects
with, the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not
at the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, no Subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act. Each of the consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes)
included in the Company SEC Reports presents fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the other related statements
(including the related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports presents
fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations, cash flows and
changes in shareholders\' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of its date and for the periods set forth therein, all in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as otherwise noted therein and
subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments.   SECTION 5.7. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.
Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports, since January 1, 2000, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in, and have not
entered into or engaged in any material transaction other than in, the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, and, since such date, there
has not been (a) any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or any event or
development that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (b) any action
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from January 1, 2000 through
the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
SECTION 7.1(J), SECTION 7.1(K) (assuming a threshold of $3 million for any
individual contract, arrangement or understanding and a threshold of $27.9
million for all contracts, arrangements or understandings in the aggregate),
SECTION 7.1(M) (assuming a threshold of $3 million for agreements with a term
longer than one year), SECTION 7.1(P) or SECTION 7.1(R) or (c) any action
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from June 30, 2000 through
the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
SECTION 7.1(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (I), (L), (N), (O) OR
(Q).   SECTION 5.8. NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as and to the
extent disclosed or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, or in the notes thereto, included in the Company SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof or as incurred after the date thereof in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and not prohibited
by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent
or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or disclosed
in the notes thereto).   23   SECTION 5.9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, LABOR
MATTERS.   (a) SECTION 5.9(A) of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth
a true and complete list as of the date hereof of each material employee
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and contract for employment or
benefits, including, but not limited to, severance or change of control
agreements, maintained, or contributed to, by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
entity described in Section 4.14(b), (c) or (m) of the Code is required to
contribute (the "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS"). With respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, the Company has heretofore delivered or made available to
Parent a true, correct and complete copy of (i) each material writing
constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan, including without
limitation all plan documents, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and
other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series)
and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current summary plan description
and any material modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not
required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial
report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the
most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS"), if any. Except as provided in the foregoing documents delivered
to Parent, there are no amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that have
been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new
plan.   (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the
Code, (i) the present value of accrued benefits under such Company Benefit
Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the
most recent actuarial report prepared by such Company Benefit Plan\'s actuary
with respect to such Company Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest
valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company
Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (ii) no "reportable event"
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been
waived, (iii) there does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within
the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or
not waived, (iv) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
("PBGC") have been timely paid in full, (v) no liability (other than for
premiums to PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Company
Benefit Plan to which contributions have been made, or an obligation to make
contributions has been present, during the last six years, (vi) the PBGC has
not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Company Benefit Plan and, to
the Company\'s knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee
to administer, any such Company Benefit Plan and (vii) there does not exist
any liability of the Company as a result of a failure to comply with the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code, except where the failure of any of the
foregoing to be true would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No Company
Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN").
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has at any time during the
last six years, (A) contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan or (B) incurred any withdrawal
liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, that has not been satisfied in
full.   (c) Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in accordance with applicable Laws and administrative rules and
regulations of any Governmental Entity, including, but   24  not limited
to, ERISA and the Code, except where a violation of any such Law, rule or
regulation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the
Company Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter as
to such qualification from the IRS or, with respect to plans qualified in
Puerto Rico, from the Treasury Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
and no event has occurred, either by reason of any action or failure to act,
which would cause the loss of any such qualification, except where such
action or failure to act can be cured without having, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No Company Benefit Plan
provides benefits, including, without limitation, death or medical benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law,

the use or possession of which by the Company or its Subsidiaries is
necessary to carry on its business. The Company and its Subsidiaries have (i)
good and marketable title in fee simple to all Company Real Property owned by
it (the "COMPANY OWNED REAL PROPERTY") and (ii) valid leaseholds under valid
and enforceable leases in all Company Real Property leased by it, in each
case free and clear of all Liens, other than Company Permitted Liens, except
in each case where the failure to have the same would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company Real Property is subject
to any lease, other than leases identified in SECTION 5.16 of the Company
Disclosure Statement (the   28  "COMPANY LEASES"), sublease, license or
other agreement granting to any person any right to the use, occupancy or

Company Financial Advisor, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect

Shares (other than Parent, Dakota Holdings and their respective Affiliates)
from a financial point of view. A complete and correct signed copy of such
opinion has been delivered to Parent, and such opinion has not been withdrawn
or modified. The Company has been authorized by the Special Committee

of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized or
formed, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and has all requisite
corporate or other power   29  and authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized or formed,
existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger. Each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
property makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger. Parent has delivered to the Company
complete and correct copies of Parent\'s certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, and has made available to the Company the certificates of incorporation
and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of its material
Subsidiaries, each as in effect on the date hereof.   SECTION 6.2.
SUBSIDIARIES. SECTION 6.2 of the Parent Disclosure Statement lists each
Subsidiary of Parent and its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and

therein. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each such Subsidiary have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by
Parent, by another Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent or by Parent and one or
more Wholly Owned Subsidiaries of Parent, free and clear of all Liens, other
than Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except for the capital
stock of, or other ownership interests in, its Subsidiaries noted above,
Parent does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
equity or similar interest in, any other Person.   SECTION 6.3.

Plan (the "PARENT STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS"), with an average exercise price of
$15.34 per share, and (d) 7,200,088 Parent Common Shares were reserved for
the grant of additional awards under the Parent Stock Incentive Plans. Since
January 1, 2000, no shares of capital stock of Parent have been issued except
pursuant to the exercise of options or conversion of convertible securities
of Parent outstanding as of January 1, 2000 in accordance with the terms
thereof. Except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement, no
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are no phantom stock or other
contractual rights the value of which is determined in whole or in part by
the value of any capital stock of Parent. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent are, and all shares which may be issued will be, when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of Parent may vote. Except for this Agreement and the
Rights, and except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Parent is a
party or by which Parent is bound obligating Parent to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of Parent or obligating Parent to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There are no outstanding

herein, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, issued in compliance with all applicable federal and
state securities Laws and will be free of any and all Liens (including
preemptive rights), other than restrictions on transfer under state and/or
federal securities Laws applicable to Affiliates of Parent under Rule 144 of
the Exchange Act and Affiliates of the Company under Rule 145 of the Exchange
Act.   SECTION 6.4. AUTHORITY.   (a) The Board of Directors of each of
Parent and Merger Sub has duly adopted resolutions approving this Agreement,
the Company Stockholder Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger and the issuance of Parent Common
Shares in accordance with the Merger (the "SHARE ISSUANCE"). Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Voting Agreement and,
subject to the approval of the Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast (PROVIDED, that the total votes cast represent
over 50% in interest of all securities entitled to vote) (the "PARENT
STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Company Stockholder Voting Agreement and the consummation by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger, the Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Company Stockholder Agreement or
to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than the Parent
Stockholder Approval). This Agreement and the Company Stockholder Voting
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Voting Agreement
constitute valid and binding obligations of the other parties hereto and
thereto, constitute valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).   (b) Parent has taken all appropriate actions so that,
as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, a "Distribution
Date" (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) shall not be deemed to
occur, the Rights shall not separate from the Parent Common Shares (to the
extent the Parent Rights Agreement otherwise provides for such separation) or
become exercisable and the Company shall not become an Acquiring Person (as
defined in the Parent Rights Agreement). The current holders of Rights will
have no additional rights under the Parent Rights Agreement as a result of
the Merger, the Share Issuance or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. No state takeover statute or regulation is applicable to the
Merger.   SECTION 6.5. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS, NO VIOLATIONS. Except for
filings and Permits as may be required under, and other applicable
requirements of, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act (including the filing
with the SEC of the Registration Statement), Blue Sky Laws, the HSR Act and
the DGCL, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
and the Company Stockholder Voting Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub nor the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any  
31  provision of the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
Parent or Merger Sub; (b) require any Authorization of any Governmental
Entity; (c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound; or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (b), (c) or
(d), for failures to obtain Authorizations, violations, breaches or defaults
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger.   SECTION 6.6. SEC REPORTS AND FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. Parent has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses
forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since May 20, 1999 (collectively, the

material respects with, the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
hereof, no Subsidiary of Parent is subject to the periodic

position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the other
related statements (including the related notes) included in the Parent SEC

all in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments.   SECTION

SEC Reports, since January 1, 2000, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their businesses in, and have not entered into or engaged in
any material transaction other than in, the ordinary course consistent with
past practice, and, since such date, there has not been (a) any Material
Adverse Effect on Parent or any event or development that would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, (b) any action taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
January 1, 2000 through the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would
constitute a breach of SECTION 7.2(J), (L) or (M) or (C) any action taken by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from June 30, 2000 through the date of this
Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of SECTION 7.2(A), (B),
(C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (I) or (K).   SECTION 6.8. NO UNDISCLOSED
LIABILITIES. Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent, or in the notes thereto, included in
the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as
incurred after the date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and not prohibited by this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (or disclosed in the notes thereto).   32   SECTION 6.9.

required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial
report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the
most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any. Except as provided in
the foregoing documents delivered to the Company, there are no amendments to
any Parent Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or
approve any new plan.   (b) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or
4971 of the Code, (i) the present value of accrued benefits under such Parent
Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes
in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Parent Benefit Plan\'s
actuary with respect to such Parent Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest
valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such Parent
Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (ii) no "reportable event"
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to
any Parent Benefit Plan for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been

not waived, (iv) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full, (v)
no liability (other than for premiums to PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to a Parent Benefit Plan to which contributions have been made, or an
obligation to make contributions has been present, during the last six years,
(vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Parent
Benefit Plan and, to Parent\'s knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute
grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Parent Benefit Plan and
(vii) there does not exist any liability of Parent as a result of a failure
to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, except where the failure of any of
the foregoing to be true would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No Parent
Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has at any time during the last six years,
(A) contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan
or Multiple Employer Plan or (B) incurred any withdrawal liability to
a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from
such Multiemployer Plan, that has not been satisfied in full.   (c) Each of
the Parent Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in accordance
with applicable Laws and administrative rules and regulations of
any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code,
except where a violation of any such Law, rule or regulation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of the Parent Benefit Plans intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter as to such qualification from the IRS or, with
respect to plans qualified in a foreign jurisdiction, from the applicable
Governmental   33  Entity, and no event has occurred, either by reason of
any action or failure to act, which would cause the loss of any such
qualification, except where such action or failure to act can be cured
without having, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. No Parent Benefit Plan provides benefits, including, without
limitation, death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect
to current or former employees of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof beyond
their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under
any "employee pension plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), (iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the
books of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof or (iv) benefits the full cost of
which is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary). All
contributions or other amounts accrued or due from Parent or any Subsidiary
thereof as of the Effective Time with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan in
respect of current or prior plan years will have been paid or accrued by such
time in accordance with GAAP.   (d) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary
thereof is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof, and no
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being
negotiated by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof. There is no labor dispute,
strike, slowdown or work stoppage against Parent or any Subsidiary thereof
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened that would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, none of Parent, any Subsidiary thereof
or their respective representatives or employees has committed any unfair
labor practices in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof, and there is no charge or complaint
against Parent or any Subsidiary thereof by the National Labor Relations
Board or any comparable state or foreign agency pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened, except where such unfair labor practice, charge or
complaint would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (e) Parent has identified in
SECTION 6.9(E) of the Parent Disclosure Statement and has made available to
the Company true and complete copies of all plans, programs or arrangements
(i) to provide compensation by grant of, or to allow the purchase of, Parent
stock or stock of a predecessor employer, (ii) to provide incentive bonuses,
(iii) to allow for, or provide for, the deferral of compensation other than
through a plan described in Section 401(a) of the Code; and with respect to
all such plans, programs or arrangements, all contributions, if any, accrued
or due from Parent or any Subsidiary thereof as of the Effective Time in
respect of current or prior plan years will have been paid or accrued by such
time in accordance with GAAP. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) (A) result in any material payment (including,
without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of Parent or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof from Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise, (B) materially increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent Benefit Plan or (C) result in
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material
benefits.   (f) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary thereof is a party to any
contract, plan, or arrangement under which it is obligated to make or to
provide, or could become obligated to make or to provide, a payment or
benefit that would be nondeductible under Section 162(m) or 280G of the
Code.   SECTION 6.10. CONTRACTS; INDEBTEDNESS.   (a) Except as disclosed

condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause
such a violation of or default under)) any Material Parent Contract, except
for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.  
(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is a party to or is bound by any
Material Parent Contract which (i) provides that the terms thereof or any

altered (including, without limitation, by means of acceleration) by, or are

resolved from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any such judgments, orders, decrees,
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, and Parent has and is in
