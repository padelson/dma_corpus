among UAL Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("United"),
Continental Airlines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Continental"), and
JT Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
United ("Merger Sub").

 

 

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of United and Continental deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective
stockholders that United and Continental engage in a "merger of equals"
business combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business
interests of each of United and Continental;

 

 

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of United and Continental have
determined that such "merger of equals" business combination shall be
effected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement through the Merger (as
defined in Section 1.1);

 

 

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of United, Continental and Merger
Sub have approved this Agreement and determined that the terms of this
Agreement are in the respective best interests of United, Continental or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, and their respective stockholders;

 

 

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Continental and Merger Sub have
declared the advisability of this Agreement and recommended adoption of this
Agreement by their respective stockholders;

 

 

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (such
Tax treatment being referred to as the "Intended Tax Treatment"), (b) this
Agreement be, and is hereby, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and (c) United, Continental and
Merger Sub each be a "party to the reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code; and

 

 

WHEREAS United, Continental and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

 

  1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Law"), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Continental (the "Merger"). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Continental shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger
(the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, Continental
shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of United.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 1.2 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take place at
the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be
specified by United and Continental, which shall be no later than the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
United and Continental; provided, however, that, if any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII is not satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waived on such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the
first Business Day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

 

 

  1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of Merger and the
Restated Charter, in each case in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Delaware Law,
and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all
other filings required under the Delaware Law or by the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the certificate of merger relating to the Merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") has been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as United and Continental
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time"). The Restated Charter shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware immediately prior
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger and shall become effective at the
Effective Time.

 

 

   1.4 Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the Delaware Law.

 

 

  1.5 Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws.

 

 

  (a) Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The
certificate of incorporation of Continental, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to
read in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, such
certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law. The by-laws of Continental shall be amended and
restated at the Effective Time to be the same as the by-laws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 

  (b)   United Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. Subject to
receipt of the United Charter Stockholder Approval, the United Charter (as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time), shall be amended and
restated as of the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit B-1
(the "Restated Charter") and, as so amended and restated, such certificate
of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of United
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. The Restated Charter shall provide, among other things, that
the name of United shall be changed at the Effective Time to "United
Continental Holdings, Inc." The United Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
to read in the form of Exhibit B-2 and, as so amended and restated, such by-
laws shall be the by-laws of United until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law (the "United-Continental Bylaws").

 1.6 Alternative Structure. The parties agree to cooperate reasonably in
the consideration of alternative structures to implement the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are mutually agreeable to
Continental and United, but only with respect to any such alternative
structure that does not (a) impose any material delay on, or condition to,
the consummation of the Merger, (b) adversely affect any of the parties
hereto or either United's or Continental's stockholders or (c) result in
additional liability to the directors or officers of United or Continental.

 

 

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK;

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

 

 

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of United, Continental, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares
of Continental Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

 

(i)  Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(ii)   Cancelation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Continental (such shares, the "Continental
Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is owned by Continental and each share of Continental Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by United or Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(iii)   Conversion of Continental Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(e),
each share of Continental Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(a)(ii)), shall be converted into the right to receive 1.05
(the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of United (the "United Common Stock," and such
shares of United Common Stock into which shares of Continental Common Stock
are converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii), the
"Merger Consideration"). All shares of Continental Common Stock converted
pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii), when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Continental Common Stock (each such
certificate, whether represented in certificated or non-certificated book-
entry form, to the extent applicable, a "Certificate") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of United Common
Stock to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(e)
and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled
upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2(c), without interest.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)   Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time (and as permitted by Article V), the outstanding shares
of United Capital Stock or Continental Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide
to the holders of United Capital Stock and the holders of Continental Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.

 

 

   2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a)  Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, United and
Continental shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to be mutually
agreed upon to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the delivery
of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, United shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of United Common Stock
to be delivered as the Merger Consideration (such certificates, whether
represented in certificated or non-certificated book-entry form, to
the extent applicable, the "United Common Certificates"). In addition,
United shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and to pay any dividends or other distributions which holders
of Certificates have the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
All such United Common Certificates and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)   Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, United shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(iii) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties
which (A) shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and (B) shall have such other provisions as United and
Continental may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a United Common Certificate
representing that number of whole shares of United Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the aggregate number of shares
of Continental Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
pursuant to Section 2.1 and a check representing cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Continental Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Continental, a United Common Certificate representing the proper
number of shares of United Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 and a check
representing cash in lieu of fractional shares that the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and in respect of any dividends or
other distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) may be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Continental Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder
of such Certificate has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to Section 2.1 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.2(c)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

 

(c)  Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to United Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of United Common Stock
deliverable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until
the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to escheat or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificate, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional share of United Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such number of whole shares of United Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such number of whole shares of United Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Continental Common Stock. The shares of
United Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Continental Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Continental Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of Continental other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of United
Common Stock to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions that holders have the right
to receive upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2(c), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of Continental
shall be closed with respect to all shares of Continental Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Continental
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares
of Continental Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
United or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

 

(e) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of United Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of United Common Stock shall be delivered upon
the conversion of Continental Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of United Common Stock. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Continental
Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of United Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender of such holder's
Certificates, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
amount multiplied by (x) if the United Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ
at the Effective Time, the NASDAQ Official Closing Price of United Common
Stock (as reported in The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition) or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by United
and Continental) or (y) if the United Common Stock is listed on the NYSE at
the Effective Time, the last reported sale price of United Common Stock, as
reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by United and Continental), in
each case on the first trading day immediately following the date on which
the Effective Time occurs.

 

 

(f)  Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
United, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to United for
satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

(g) No Liability. None of United, Continental, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger
Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article II
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of United, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by United on a daily basis, provided that,
subject to Section 2.2(g), no such investment or losses will affect the cash
payable to holders of Certificates. Any interest or other amounts received
with respect to such investments shall be paid to United.

 

 

(i)   Withholding Rights. Each of United and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any
amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Certificate in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 

 

(j)   Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by United, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as United may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
2.2(g), United) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

United Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, United License, license,

that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on United. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as of the date of this Agreement, United is not a party to, or
subject to, any standstill agreement or similar agreement that restricts any
Person from engaging in negotiations or discussions with United or from

 3.5 Reports. United and each of the United Subsidiaries have timely filed
all submissions, reports, registrations, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents, together with any amendments required to be made with
respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2009 with
(i) the FAA, (ii) the DOT, (iii) the SEC, (iv) any state or other federal
regulatory authority (other than any taxing authority, which is covered by
Section 3.10) and (v) any foreign regulatory authority (other than any taxing
authority, which is covered by Section 3.10) (collectively,
"Regulatory Agencies"), and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to
file such report, registration, schedule, form, statement or other document,
or to pay such fees and assessments, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
United. No publicly available final registration statement, prospectus,
report, form, schedule or definitive proxy statement filed since January 1,
2009 by United with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"United SEC Reports"), as of the date of such United SEC Report, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. Since January 1, 2009, as of their respective dates, all United SEC
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the rules and regulations thereunder
with respect thereto.

 

 

  3.6 Financial Statements. (a) United has previously made available to
Continental copies of (i) the consolidated balance sheet of United and the
United Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),
cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2009, as reported in United's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, including any amendments
thereto filed with the SEC prior to the Measurement Date, filed with the SEC
under the Exchange Act, accompanied by the audit report of Deloitte and Touche
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to United

United and the United Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2010 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash
flows and stockholders' equity for the three-month periods ended March 31,
2009 and 2010, as reported in United's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended March 31, 2010, including any amendments thereto filed

applicable) included in the United Financial Statements fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of United and the
United Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the other financial
statements included in the United Financial Statements (including the related
notes, where applicable) fairly present in all material respects the results
of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders' equity and cash

therein set forth, subject, in the case of the Unaudited United Financial
Statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments that are immaterial in
nature and in amounts consistent with past experience; each of
such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto; and each of the United Financial Statements (including
the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all material
respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. To United's knowledge, there is no applicable accounting rule,
consensus or pronouncement that has been adopted by the SEC, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the Emerging Issues Task Force or any similar
body as of, but is not in effect as of, the date of this Agreement that, if
implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on United (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.6(a), effects
resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause
(vi) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be
excluded in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on United would
reasonably be expected to occur).

suspended, and there is not pending or, to United's knowledge, threatened,
any material application, petition, objection or other pleading with the FAA,
DOT or any other Governmental Entity that challenges or questions the

knowledge, there is no applicable accounting rule, consensus or pronouncement
that has been adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
the Emerging Issues Task Force or any similar body as of, but is not in
effect as of, the date of this Agreement that, if implemented, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Continental (it
being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.6(a), effects resulting
from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause (vi)
of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on Continental would
reasonably be expected to occur).

the Continental Financial Statements, and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31,

calendar months or the fair market value of all the assets of the Target
Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction; provided, however, that no transaction involving solely the
acquisition of capital stock or assets of any United Subsidiary by United, or
of any Continental Subsidiary by Continental, will be deemed to be a
Competing Transaction. Wherever the term "group" is used in this Agreement,
it used as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

 

(d) The Target Party will notify the Non-Target Party promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry or request for non-public information relating to the Target
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that is
reasonably likely to lead to or contemplate an Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice to the Non-Target Party will be made orally and in writing and will
indicate the identity of the Person or Persons making the Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry or requesting non-public information or access to the
properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a written
summary in reasonable detail of the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request or modification or amendment to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Target Party will (i) keep the Non-Target Party fully informed,
on a current basis, of any material changes in the status of, and any
material changes or modifications in the terms of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and, if requested by the Non-Target Party,
counsel for the Target Party will consult with counsel for the Non-Target
Party once per day, at mutually agreeable times, regarding such status and
any such changes or modifications, and (ii) provide to the Non-Target Party
as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Target
Party from any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
sent or provided by the Target Party to any third party in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that any material written
material or material correspondence will be sent or provided pursuant to
clause (ii) within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof. Neither
United nor Continental will enter into any agreement on or after the date
hereof that would prevent such party from providing any information required
by this Section 5.5 to the other party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, at any
time prior to obtaining the United Stockholder Approvals or the
Continental Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Target Party may furnish
or cause to be furnished information to, and enter or cause to be entered
into discussions with, and only with, a Person (and its representatives) who
has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited on
or after the date of this Agreement and that did not otherwise result from a
breach of Section 5.5(a) or Section 5.5(b), as applicable, if the Target
Party's Board of Directors (the "Target Board") has (i) determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor or advisors) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to enter
into discussions regarding the Acquisition Proposal would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) provided at least five Business
Days' notice to the Non-Target Party of its intent to furnish information to
or enter into discussions with such Person in accordance with this Section
5.5(e), and (iii) obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms that are determined in good faith by the Target
Party to be substantially similar to and not less favorable to the Target
Party in the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related
agreements will not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to
negotiate with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting the Target
Party from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement. Unless such
information has been previously provided to the Non-Target Party, all
information that is provided by the Target Party to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal will be provided to the Non-Target Party. During the
five Business Day period set forth in clause (ii) above, the Non-Target
Party will have the right to make a presentation to the Target Board.

 

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal made by a third Person (or group of Persons) to
consummate a merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar
transaction involving the Target Party pursuant to which the stockholders of
the Target Party immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than
65% of the outstanding shares of common stock of, or less than 65% of the
outstanding voting power of, the Target Party, any surviving entity or the
parent entity resulting from any such transaction immediately
upon consummation thereof that the Target Board (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor or advisors) determines in
good faith to be more favorable to the Target Party's stockholders than the
Merger, taking into account all relevant factors, including value and other
financial considerations, legal and regulatory considerations and any
conditions to, and expected timing and risks of, completion, as well as any
changes to the terms of the Merger proposed by the Non-Target Party in
response to such Superior Proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Except as permitted by this Section 5.5(g), neither the Target Board nor
any committee thereof will (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the
Non-Target Party the recommendation, approval or declaration of advisability
by the Target Board, or any such committee, of this Agreement, the Restated
Charter and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, (ii) recommend, approve or declare advisable the approval or adoption
of any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) resolve, agree or propose publicly to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in this sentence of this
Section 5.5(g) being referred to herein as an "Adverse
Recommendation Change") or approve, adopt or recommend, or cause or permit
the Target Party to enter into, or resolve, agree or propose publicly to do
so with respect to, any United Acquisition Agreement (in the case of United)
or Continental Acquisition Agreement (in the case of Continental) (other than
a confidentiality agreement as referred to in Section 5.5(e)).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the United Stockholder Approvals or the Continental
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Target Board, in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisor or advisors, that to do otherwise would
be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Target
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that
the Target Board may only make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (A)
the Target Party has provided written notice to the Non-Target Party (a
"Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change") advising the Non-Target Party that
the Target Board intends to take such action, (B) if any Acquisition Proposal
has been made prior to the date of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change (regardless of whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal), the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change specifies the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, identifying the Person or
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and including a copy of the most
current version of the agreement or proposal (if in writing) relating to such
Acquisition Proposal, (C) at least five Business Days have elapsed following
the Non-Target Party's receipt of such Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change (it being understood that any amendment or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal that is the basis for such proposed action shall require
a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and a new five Business Day
period) and (D) if requested by the Non-Target Party, the Target Party has
negotiated in good faith with the Non-Target Party during such five Business
Day period (as extended pursuant to clause (C)) with respect to any changes
to this Agreement proposed by the Non-Target Party during such period. In
determining whether to give a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or make
an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Target Board shall take into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Non-Target Party.
The Target Party will not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal, or, except as permitted herein, propose to do so.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) (i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 will prohibit the Target Party
or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and (ii) no disclosure that the United Board or the Continental Board may
determine (after consultation with counsel) that it or United or Continental,
as applicable, is required to make under applicable Law will constitute a
violation of this Agreement; provided, however, that in any event neither the
United Board nor the Continental Board shall make an Adverse Recommendation
Change except in accordance with Section 5.5(g). Any disclosure by the Target
Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Target Party unless the Target Board reaffirms
its recommendation and declaration of advisability with respect to this
Agreement in such disclosure.

 

 

(i)  Each of United and Continental and their respective Subsidiaries
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other party to this
Agreement) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons, other than the other
party hereto, who have been furnished confidential information regarding such
party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an
Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement
promptly to return or destroy such information.

 

 

(j)   It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.5 by any director, officer, employee, controlled Affiliate,
agent or representative (including financial or legal advisor or other
retained representative) of either party or any of its Subsidiaries or
controlled Affiliates will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.5
by such party.

 6.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable Law, each of Continental and United shall, and shall
cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and
to the Representatives of such other party reasonable access during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each
of Continental and United shall, and shall cause each of its respective
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws or federal or state Laws applicable to certificated air
carriers (other than such documents that such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable Law) and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request; provided, however, that either party may withhold any document or
information (i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement
with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or
entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business (provided that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or fiduciary
duty (provided that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (iii)
that is subject to any attorney-client privilege (provided that the
withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege). Furthermore, the parties acknowledge that with
respect to the "Highly Sensitive Information" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement), the Confidentiality Agreement imposes additional
restrictions as to the manner in which such information will be exchanged by
the parties. If any material is withheld by such party pursuant to
the proviso to the preceding sentence, such party shall inform the other
party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of United and Continental shall, within
two Business Days of request by the other party therefor, provide to such
other party the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the
Exchange Act and any information to which a holder of United Common Stock or
Continental Common Stock, as applicable, would be entitled under Section 220
of the Delaware Law (assuming such holder met the requirements of
such section). All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall
be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated April 12, 2010
between Continental and United (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The
parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement supersedes that certain
confidentiality agreement dated April 15, 2008 between Continental and United
(the "Prior Confidentiality Agreement") and that any information constituting
"Evaluation Material" under and as defined in the Prior Confidentiality
Agreement shall, from and after the date of this Agreement, be deemed
"Evaluation Material" under and as defined in, and subject to the terms of,
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 6.3 Required Actions. (a) Each of the parties shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary to consummate and make
effective, as soon as reasonably possible, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.3 shall
prohibit either party from taking any action expressly contemplated
by Section 5.5.

 

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.3(a), United and the
United Board and Continental and the Continental Board shall (x) take all
action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any Takeover Statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.3(a), promptly
following the execution and delivery by the parties of this Agreement United
and Continental shall provide all necessary notices, applications
and requests to, and enter into discussions with, the Governmental Entities
from whom Consents or nonactions are required to be obtained in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in order to obtain all such required Consents or nonactions
from such Governmental Entities and eliminate each and every other impediment
that may be asserted by such Governmental Entities, in each case with respect
to the Merger, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable. To the extent necessary in order to accomplish
the foregoing, United and Continental shall jointly propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on, (A)
the ownership or operation by United, Continental or any of their
respective Subsidiaries of any portion of the business, properties or assets
of United, Continental or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) the
ability of United to acquire or hold, or exercise full right of ownership of,
any shares of the capital stock of the United Subsidiaries or Continental or
the Continental Subsidiaries, including the right to vote, or (C) United or
any of its Subsidiaries effectively controlling the business or operations of
United and the United Subsidiaries or Continental and the Continental
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that neither Continental nor United shall be
required pursuant to this Section 6.3(c) to propose, commit to or effect any
action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. If the
actions taken by Continental and United pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence do not result in the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(d) and (f)
being satisfied, then each of Continental and United shall jointly (to the
extent practicable) initiate and/or participate in any proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, in order to (i) oppose or defend against any
action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) take such action as necessary to overturn any regulatory action by
any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by defending any
suit, action or other legal proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity in
order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated,
including by appeal if necessary, any Injunction resulting from any suit,
action or other legal proceeding that would cause any condition set forth in
Section 7.1(d) or (f) not to be satisfied, provided that Continental and
United shall cooperate with one another in connection with, and shall jointly
control, all proceedings related to the foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Continental and United shall:

 

 

(i)  make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other
and as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in any
event, with respect to clause (A) below, within five Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, and with respect to clause (B) below, at a time
necessary to ensure that the EU Extension Date occurs prior to the
Latest Possible End Date), (A) an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act relating to the Merger, (B) all
appropriate filings required pursuant to European Community Council
Regulation No. 139/2004 (the "EU Merger Regulation"), and (C) all other
necessary registrations, declarations, notices and filings relating to the
Merger with other Governmental Entities under any other antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or similar Laws;

 

 

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice or filing and in order to achieve the effects set forth in
Section 6.3(c);

 

 

(iii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration,
declaration, notice or filing and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger
(including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section 6.3(c)),
and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in connection
with, any such registration, declaration, notice, filing or communication;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Entity or any other authority
enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, trade regulation or similar Laws
for additional information or documentation in connection with antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or similar matters;

 

 

(v) without limiting the generality of Section 6.3(d)(iv), (A) use its
reasonable best efforts to achieve Substantial Compliance as promptly as
practicable with any request for additional information or documentary
material issued by a Governmental Entity under 15 U.S.C. Sect. 18a(e) and in
conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a
"Second Request"), (B) certify Substantial Compliance with any
Second Request as promptly as practicable after the date of such Second
Request, but in no event later than September 30, 2010, (C) take all actions
necessary to assert, defend and support its certification of Substantial
Compliance with such Second Request and (D) not extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with such Governmental Entities
or other authorities to delay, or otherwise not to consummate as soon as
practicable, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except
with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which consent may
be withheld in the sole discretion of the non-requesting party; and

 

 

(vi) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or
attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any
of the actions referred to in Section 6.3(c)) without the other, (B) to the
extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any
such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating or
attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such
party reasonably apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing
of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other
written communications explaining or defending this Agreement and the Merger,
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity, and (E) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entity's staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
Section 6.3 shall not be construed to require United or any United Subsidiary
or Continental or any Continental Subsidiary to undertake any efforts or to
take any action if the taking of such efforts or action is or would
reasonably be expected to result (after giving effect to any reasonably
expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets) in a Material Adverse
Effect on either United or Continental, as applicable.

 

 

(f) Continental shall give prompt notice to United, and United shall give
prompt notice to Continental, of (i) any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty
that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement; provided further, that a failure to comply with this
Section 6.3(f) will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying inaccuracy or breach would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of the parties hereto, United, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
adopt this Agreement.

 

 

(h) Each of Continental and United shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the United Common Stock to be listed on either the NASDAQ or the NYSE,
as reasonably agreed upon by Continental and United, after the Effective Time
and to cause the trading symbol for the United Common Stock on such exchange
after the Effective Time to be the trading symbol reasonably agreed upon by
Continental and United.

 

 

  6.4 Stock Plans. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Continental Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Continental
Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required to effect the following:

 

 

(i)   except as provided in Section 6.4(a)(iii), adjust the terms of all
outstanding Continental Stock Options to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each Continental Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed to constitute an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Continental Stock Option, a number of shares of United Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Continental Common Stock subject to such Continental Stock Option
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
United Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to quotient
of (x) the exercise price per share of Continental Common Stock under such
Continental Stock Option divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (each, a
"Continental Rollover Option"); provided, however, that in the case of any
option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under either Section 422 or 424 of the Code, the option price,
the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to
comply with Section 424(a) of the Code;

 

 

(ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Continental Stock-Based Awards

 6.6 Indemnification and Directors and Officers Insurance. (a) United
agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of Continental and its respective Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Party") shall be assumed by United and shall survive the Merger
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, United shall purchase a "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for Continental and its
current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
Continental in a form reasonably acceptable to Continental that shall provide
Continental and such directors and officers with coverage for six years
following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Continental;
provided, however, that in no event will United be required to expend for any
year of such six-year period an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
aggregate premiums currently paid by United for such insurance (the
"Maximum Premium"). United shall maintain such policy in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at
an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, United will cause to
be maintained the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers'
insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 will survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. United will pay
or cause to be paid (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.6 (subject to

corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will
be made so that the successors and assigns of United, as the case may be,
will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

 

 6.7 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in this Section 6.7,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such expense; provided, however, that United and Continental shall
share equally (i) all fees and expenses in relation to the printing

provided, however, for purposes of this clause (ii), unless a Competing

same Person (or any Affiliate thereof), any reference in the definition of
Competing Transaction to 10% shall be deemed to be a reference to 35%; or

 

 

(iii) by Continental or United pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and (x) a proposal
for a Competing Transaction has been made to Continental or its stockholders
or such a proposal (whether or not conditional) or an intention to make such

then, United will pay Continental the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Continental, in the case of
termination referred to in Section 6.7(c)(ii) or (iii), upon the earliest to
occur of the events referred to in Section 6.7(c)(ii)(y) or Section

(d) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.7
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 6.7 and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the non-paying party for the amounts set forth in this Section 6.7, the non-
paying party will pay to the other party interest, from the date such payment
was required to be made, on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.7 at a
rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source selected by the party entitled to such amounts) on the
date such payment was required to be made (or if no quotation for three-month
LIBOR is available for such date, on the next preceding date for which such a
quotation is available) plus 250 basis points. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Termination Fee shall not constitute either a penalty or
liquidated damages, and the right of a party to receive, or the receipt of,
the Termination Fee shall not limit or otherwise affect such party's right to
specific performance as provided in Section 9.10, such party's rights as set
forth in Section 8.2 or Section 9.7 or any other remedies that may be
available for breaches of this Agreement, including breaches of Section 5.5
of this Agreement.

 6.8 Certain Tax Matters. (a) United and Continental shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify for the Intended

would reasonably be expected to prevent such qualification and (ii) executing
such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order to
obtain such qualification (it being understood that no party will be required
to agree to any such amendment). For Federal income Tax purposes, each
of United, Continental and Merger Sub will report the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with
such qualification.

 

 

(b) United and Continental shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c), including
by causing its officers to execute and deliver to the law firms delivering
such Tax opinions certificates substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibits C-2 and D-2 at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by
such law firms, including at the time the Form S-4 is filed and at the
Closing Date. Each of United, Continental and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that
would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action
which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the representations included
in the certificates described in this Section 6.8. It is understood and
agreed that the parties' right to take any action disclosed in Sections 5.1,
5.2 or 5.3 of the United Disclosure Schedule or the Continental Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, will be subject to and subordinate to the parties'
respective obligations under this Section 6.8.

 

 

 6.9 Transaction Litigation. Continental shall give United the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Continental and/or its directors relating to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of United, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. United shall
give Continental the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against United and/or its directors relating to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Continental, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph, "participate" means that
the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and
other significant decisions with respect to the litigation by the litigating
party (to the extent the attorney-client privilege between the litigating
party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and the non-
litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power or other
authority over the litigation except for the settlement consent set forth
above.

Person who is employed by Continental or United or any of their respective
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, except with respect to
any such employees who are represented for purposes of collective bargaining
pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (the
"Continuing Employees"), compensation (including base salary and incentive
and bonus opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) and
benefits (including vacation, paid time-off and severance) that are not
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) than those provided to the

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The service of each Continuing Employee with Continental or United or any

with its terms, each Continental Benefit Plan and all obligations thereunder,
including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions

all purposes under such Continental Benefit Plans.

 

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring United or any
of its Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time
following the Closing Date. Except as provided in Section 6.13, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent United
or any of its Subsidiaries from (i) terminating, or modifying the terms
of employment of, any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date or
(ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any Continental Benefit Plan,
United Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that United or any of its Subsidiaries may establish or
maintain; provided, however, that to the extent that, and for so long as, a
Continuing Employee remains employed by United or any of its Subsidiaries
during the six-month period following the Closing, the compensation and
benefits payable to such employee during such period shall be subject to
Section 6.12(a). Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
an amendment to any United Benefit Plan or Continental Benefit Plan or any
other compensation and benefit plans maintained for or provided to directors,
officers or employees of United or Continental prior to or following the
Effective Time.

Continental's collective bargaining agreements listed in Section 4.12 of the
Continental Disclosure Schedule, and all amendments thereto (the "Continental
CBAs"), as well as copies of letters or employee materials relating to
business combination consequences that Continental has sent or provided to
certain groups of its employees that are not covered by collective bargaining
agreements (the "Continental Non-Union Employee Letters"). Annex B sets
forth certain sections of the Continental CBAs and the Non-Union Employee
Letters regarding successor transactions, including those sections listed
under the heading "Commitments" (the "Continental Employee Commitments") and
under the heading "Irrevocable Commitments" (the "Irrevocable
Continental Employee Commitments"). Each of United and Continental
hereby agrees, and will cause its Subsidiaries to agree, to abide by the
terms of the Continental Employee Commitments, as applicable, and each of
United and Continental hereby irrevocably agrees, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to agree, irrevocably to abide by the terms of the Irrevocable

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

 

 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the United Stockholder
Approvals or the Continental Stockholder Approval, by action taken or
authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating party or parties:

 

 

(a) by mutual consent of United and Continental in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) by either the United Board or the Continental Board if any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable
order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if such party's
breach of its obligations under this Agreement proximately contributed to the
occurrence of such order;

 

 

(c) by either the United Board or the Continental Board if the United
Stockholder Approvals shall not have been obtained at a United Stockholders
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which the vote was
taken;

Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a Continental
Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which the
vote was taken;

 

 

(e) by either the United Board or the Continental Board if the Merger shall
not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2010, subject to
extension by the mutual agreement of United and Continental (the "End Date");
provided, however, that (i) the End Date (A) shall be automatically extended
until the later to occur of the EU Extension Date and the Domestic Regulatory
Extension Date and (B) shall be extended to the Substantial Compliance
Extension Date (if later than the latest of the dates set forth in clause
(A) above) at the election of a party that has previously certified its
Substantial Compliance at or prior to the time of such election and (ii)
notwithstanding any extension provided for in Section 8.1(e)(i), the End Date
shall not be extended to any date that is later than September 30, 2011 (the
"Latest Possible End Date"); provided further, however, that no party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if such party's
breach of its obligations under this Agreement proximately contributed to the
failure of the Closing to occur by the End Date;

 

 

(f) by the United Board if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Continental, which
breach or inaccuracy, either individually or in the aggregate, would result
in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b), unless such failure is
reasonably capable of being cured, and Continental is continuing to use its
reasonable best efforts to cure such failure, by the End Date;

 

 

(g) by the Continental Board if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any inaccuracy of any of the representations or

occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b), unless such failure is reasonably
capable of being cured, and United is continuing to use its reasonable best
efforts to cure such failure, by the End Date;

 

 

(h) by the United Board in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change
by Continental; or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

81  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) by the Continental Board in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change
by United.

 

 

 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either United or Continental in accordance with Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of
United, Continental, any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
any of the officers or directors of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that (i)
Sections 3.7, 4.7 and 6.7, Article IX (other than Section 9.13) and the last
sentence of Section 6.2 as well as the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding any
termination or any contrary provision contained in this Agreement, neither
United nor Continental shall be relieved or released from liability for
damages of any kind, including consequential damages and any other damages
(whether or not communicated or contemplated at the time of execution of this
Agreement) and including as damages the value lost by stockholders based on
the consideration that would otherwise have been paid and the benefits that
would have accrued arising out of, any (a) knowing material breach of any of
its representations and warranties in this Agreement or (b) deliberate
material breach of any covenant of this Agreement. No party claiming that
such breach occurred will have any duty or otherwise be obligated to mitigate
any such damages. For purposes of this Section 8.2, (i) a "knowing" breach of
a representation and warranty shall be deemed to have occurred only if an
executive officer of the other party had actual knowledge of such breach as
of the date hereof (without any independent duty of investigation or
verification other than an actual reading of the representations
and warranties as they appear in this Agreement by the other party's chief
executive officer and chief legal officer and an actual reading by other
executive officers of such party of the representations and warranties
included in this Agreement on subjects relevant to the areas as to which they
have direct managerial oversight responsibility) and (ii) a "deliberate"
breach of any covenant shall be deemed to have occurred only if the other
party took or failed to take action with actual knowledge that the action so
taken or omitted to be taken constituted a breach of such covenant. For
purposes of this Section 8.2, an "executive officer" shall have the meaning
given to the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act.

 

 

 8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended by United, Merger Sub and Continental, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after the Continental Stockholder Approval, the approval of United as
stockholder of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Stockholder Approval") or the
United Stockholder Approvals; provided, however, that after the Continental
Stockholder Approval or either of the United Stockholder Approvals, there may
not be, without further approval of the stockholders of Continental or
United, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form
of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Continental Common Stock, or which by applicable Law otherwise requires the
further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

 

 8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, United
(on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) and Continental may, to the extent
legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed by an authorized officer on behalf of such party, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 9.4 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined
therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The definitions contained
in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms
of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred
to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$"
will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of
America. The term "made available" and words of similar import means that the
relevant documents, instruments or materials were (A) posted and made
available to the other party on the Intralinks due diligence data site, with
respect to United, or on the Bowne due diligence data site, with respect to
Continental, as applicable, maintained by either company for the purpose of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, prior to the date hereof, or
(B) publicly available by virtue of the relevant party's filing of a publicly
available final registration statement, prospectus, report, form, schedule or
definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, prior to the date of this Agreement. No provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or against, any of the
parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which any such party or
its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent
to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft of this
Agreement, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any
party hereto. The United Disclosure Schedule and the Continental Disclosure
Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, will be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this
Agreement. The United Disclosure Schedule and the Continental Disclosure
Schedule set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
in the United Disclosure Schedule or Continental Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, relates; provided, however, that any fact or item that is
disclosed in any section of the United Disclosure Schedule or the Continental
Disclosure Schedule so as to make its relevance (i) to other representations
made elsewhere in the Agreement, (ii) to the information called for by other
sections of the United Disclosure Schedule or the Continental Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) to the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement reasonably
apparent shall be deemed to qualify such representations or to be disclosed
in such other sections of the United Disclosure Schedule, the Continental
Disclosure Schedule or the annexes or exhibits to this Agreement, as the case
may be, notwithstanding the omission of any appropriate cross-
reference thereto; provided further that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of an item in either such disclosure
schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on United or Continental, as the
case may be. This Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to require
any Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would
violate any applicable Law. References to the "other party" or "either party"
will be deemed to refer to United and Merger Sub, collectively, on the one
hand, and Continental, on the other hand. All electronic communications from
a Person shall be deemed to be "written" for purposes of this Agreement.

 9.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this Section 9.5 with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no
circumstances shall the rights of holders of shares of Continental Common
Stock as third-party beneficiaries pursuant to Section 9.7 be exercisable,
waivable or enforceable by such stockholders or any other Person acting for
or on their behalf other than Continental and its successors in interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall the rights of
holders of shares of United Common Stock as third-party beneficiaries
pursuant to Section 9.7 be exercisable, waivable or enforceable by such
stockholders or any other Person acting for or on their behalf other than
United and its successors in interest.

 

 

 9.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 

 

 9.7 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, taken
together with the Continental Disclosure Letter and the United Disclosure
Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) is not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies other than (i) as
specifically provided in Section 6.6, (ii) the right of Continental, on
behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages and other relief, including
equitable relief, in the event of United's or Merger Sub's knowing material
breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or
deliberate material breach of any covenant in this Agreement (as the terms
"knowing" and "deliberate" are defined in Section 8.2), which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by United and Merger Sub and (iii) the right of
United, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages and other relief,
including equitable relief, in the event of Continental's knowing material
breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or
deliberate material breach of any covenant in this Agreement (as the
terms "knowing" and "deliberate" are defined in Section 8.2), which right is
hereby acknowledged and agreed by Continental; provided, however, that
the rights granted pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) shall be enforceable
on behalf of holders of Continental Common Stock only by Continental in its
sole and absolute discretion or on behalf of holders of United Common Stock
only by United in its sole and absolute discretion, it being understood and
agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach to such
shares of Continental Common Stock or United Common Stock, as applicable,
and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and, consequently, any
damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by Continental or
United, as applicable, with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred
by Continental or United, as applicable, in connection therewith) may, in
Continental's or United's, as applicable, sole and absolute discretion, be
(x) as applicable, distributed, in whole or in part, by Continental to the
holders of shares of Continental Common Stock of record as of any date
determined by Continental or by United to the holders of shares of United
Common Stock of record as of any date determined by United or (y) as
applicable, retained by Continental for the use and benefit of Continental on
behalf of its stockholders in any manner Continental deems fit or retained by
United for the use and benefit of United on behalf of its stockholders in any
manner United deems fit.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 9.8 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 

 

  9.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without such consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

 

  9.10 Specific Enforcement. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor and therefore fully intend for
specific performance to be the principal remedy for breaches of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the parties (on behalf of themselves and
the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement) shall be entitled to an
Injunction or Injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.11(a), without proof of
actual damages this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance
on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that
the agreements contained in this Section 9.10 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement. Each party
further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 9.10, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

91  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 9.11 Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) agrees that any
claim, suit, action or other proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out
of, under or relating to this Agreement, its negotiation or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will be heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such claim, action,
suit or other proceeding relating to this Agreement will be brought by it or
any of its affiliates except in such court), subject to any appeal, provided
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware, then any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding may be
brought in any Delaware state court or any federal court located in the State
of Delaware and (b) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any such court in any such claim, suit, action or other
proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such claim, suit, action or
other proceeding. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Person's respective
address set forth in Section 9.2 will be effective service of process for any
claim, action, suit or other proceeding in Delaware with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final
judgment in any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be
conclusive, subject to any appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. In
connection with any such proceeding that results in a judgment, the non-
prevailing party will pay the prevailing party its reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
such proceeding.

 

 

  9.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ITS NEGOTIATION OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

92  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.13 Publicity. Except (a) with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change
made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (b) with respect to
disclosures that are consistent with prior disclosures made in compliance
with this Section 9.13 or any communications plan or strategy previously
agreed on by the parties, United and Continental shall consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system. The parties agree that all formal employee
communication programs or announcements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in forms mutually agreed to by the
parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that no further mutual agreement shall be
required with respect to any such programs or announcements that are
consistent with prior programs or announcements made in compliance with this
Section 9.13. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

The board of directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") is
expressly authorized, without any vote or other action by the stockholders
and subject to limitations prescribed by law, to adopt, from time to time, a

in one or more series, to fix the number of shares in each such series and to

Unless otherwise indicated, any reference in this Article Fourth, Part II to

Fourth, Part II.

 

 

Section 1. Issuance; Restrictions on Transfer. The share of Class Pilot MEC
Preferred Stock shall be issued only to, and shall be held only by, (i) the
United Airlines Pilots Master Executive Council (the "MEC") of the Air Line
Pilots Association, International ("ALPA") pursuant to ALPA's authority as
the collective bargaining representative for the crafts or class of
pilots employed by United Air Lines, Inc. ("United OpCo") or (ii) a duly
authorized agent acting for the benefit of the MEC. Any purported sale,
transfer, pledge or other disposition (a "transfer") of the share of Class
Pilot MEC Preferred Stock to any person, other than a successor to the MEC by
merger or reorganization of ALPA (in any such case, an "ALPA Successor"), or
a duly authorized agent acting for the benefit of ALPA or an ALPA Successor,
shall be null and void and of no force and effect. Upon any purported
transfer of the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock by the holder
thereof other than as expressly permitted above, and without any further
action by the Corporation, such holder or any other person or entity, such
share shall, to the extent of funds legally available therefor and subject to
the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, be automatically redeemed
by the Corporation in accordance with Subsection 9.2 hereof, and thereupon
such share shall no longer be deemed outstanding, and neither such holder nor
any purported transferee thereof shall have in respect thereof any of the
voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or special
rights ascribed to the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock hereunder,
but rather such holder thereafter shall only be entitled to receive the
amount payable upon redemption in accordance with Section 9. The certificate
representing the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock shall be legended
to reflect the restrictions on transfer and automatic redemption provided for
herein.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2. Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, Part II, the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

 

 

2.1 "Affiliate" shall have the meaning defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act.

 

 

2.2 "Board of Directors" shall mean the board of directors of the Corporation
or any committee thereof authorized by such board of directors to perform any
of its responsibilities with respect to the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock.

 

 

2.3 "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day
on which state or federally chartered banking institutions in New York, New
York are not required to be open.

 

 

2.4 "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
any successor act thereto.

 

 

2.5 "set apart for payment" shall be deemed to include, without any action
other than the following, the recording by the Corporation in its accounting
ledgers of any accounting or bookkeeping entry which indicates, pursuant to a
declaration of dividends or other distribution by the Board of Directors, the
allocation of funds to be so paid on any series or class of capital stock of
the Corporation; provided, however, that if any funds for any class or series
of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with or junior to the Class
Pilot MEC Preferred Stock as to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation are placed in a separate account of the
Corporation or delivered to a disbursing, paying or other similar agent, then
"set apart for payment" with respect to the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock
shall mean, with respect to such distributions, placing such funds in a
separate account or delivering such funds to a disbursing, paying or other
similar agent.

 

 

2.6 "Transfer Agent" means the Corporation or such agent or agents of the
Corporation as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors
as the transfer agent for the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock.

 

 

Section 3. Dividends. The holder of the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred
Stock as such shall not be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions (except as provided in Section 4).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 4. Payments upon Liquidation.

 

 

4.1 In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, before any payment or distribution of the
assets of the Corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or
set apart for payment to the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation that ranks junior to the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock as to
amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the holder of the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive $0.01 for the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock
(the "MEC Liquidation Preference"), but such holder shall not be entitled to
any further payment. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof,
distributable to the holder of the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock
shall be insufficient to pay in full the MEC Liquidation Preference and the
liquidation preference on all other shares of any class or series of stock of
the Corporation that ranks on a parity with the Class Pilot MEC Preferred
Stock as to amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be
distributed among the holder of the share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock
and any such other parity stock ratably in accordance with the respective
amounts that would be payable on such share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred
Stock and any such other parity stock if all amounts payable thereon were
paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or
merger of the Corporation with or into one or more corporations, or (ii) a
sale, lease, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the
Corporation's assets, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation.

 

 

4.2 Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class of
stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the Class Pilot MEC Preferred
Stock as to amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, after payment shall have been made to the holder of the
share of Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock, as and to the fullest extent

transferor and/or transferee) an opinion of counsel selected by the Board of
Directors that the Transfer shall not result in the application of any

Section 6. Treatment of Excess Securities.

 

 

6.1 No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any Prohibited
Transfer, and the purported transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the
"Purported Transferee") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the
Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Corporation
Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the "Excess
Securities"). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another Person in a
Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall
not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any rights of
stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to
vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions,
whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any; provided,
however, that the Transferor of such Excess Securities shall not be required
to disgorge, and shall be permitted to retain for its own account, any
proceeds of such Transfer, and shall have no further rights,
responsibilities, obligations or liabilities with respect to such
Excess Securities, if such Transfer was a Prohibited Transfer pursuant
to Section 5.2(z). Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a
Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Corporation Securities
shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any transfer
of Excess Securities not in accordance with the provisions of this Section
6 shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.2 If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of Corporation
Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand by the
Corporation, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be
transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess
Securities within the Purported Transferee's possession or control, together
with any dividends or other distributions that were received by the Purported
Transferee from the Corporation with respect to the Excess Securities
("Prohibited Distributions"), to an agent designated by the Board of
Directors (the "Agent"). The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers,
which may include the Corporation, the Excess Securities transferred to it in
one or more arm's-length transactions (over the New York Stock Exchange or
other national securities exchange on which the Corporation Securities may be
traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); provided, however, that the
Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be
required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the
Agent's discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the
Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely affect the value of the
Corporation Securities. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess
Securities before receiving the Corporation's demand to surrender Excess
Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have
sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer
to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except
to the extent that the Corporation grants written permission to the Purported
Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds not exceeding the
amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent
pursuant to Section 6.3 if the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had
resold the Excess Securities.

 

 

6.3 The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities
and, if the Purported Transferee had previously resold the Excess Securities,
any amounts received by it from a Purported Transferee as follows: (x)
first, such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to
cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties
hereunder; (y) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported
Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess
Securities (or the fair market value, (1) calculated on the basis of the
closing market price for the Corporation Securities on the day before the
Prohibited Transfer, (2) if the Corporation Securities are not listed or
admitted to trading on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-
counter market, calculated based upon the difference between the highest bid
and lowest asked prices, as such prices are reported by the
National Association of Securities Dealers through its NASDAQ system or any
successor system on the day before the Prohibited Transfer or, if none, on
the last preceding day for which such quotations exist, or (3) if the
Corporation Securities are neither listed nor admitted to trading on any
stock exchange nor traded in the over-the-counter market, then as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors, of the Excess Securities at the time
of the Prohibited Transfer to the Purported Transferee by gift, inheritance,
or similar Transfer), which amount (or fair market value) shall be determined
at the discretion of the Board of Directors; and (z) third, any remaining
amounts, subject to the limitations imposed by the following proviso, shall
be paid to one or more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of
the Code (or any comparable successor provision) ("Section 501(c)(3)")
selected by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if the Excess
Securities (including any Excess Securities arising from a previous
Prohibited Transfer not sold by the Agent in a prior sale or sales),
represent a 5% or greater Percentage Stock Ownership in any class of
Corporation Securities, then any such remaining amounts to the extent
attributable to the disposition of the portion of such Excess Securities
exceeding a 4.99% Percentage Stock Ownership interest in such class shall be
paid to two or more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) selected
by the Board of Directors. The recourse of any Purported Transferee in
respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the amount payable to
the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence. In
no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this
Section 6 inure to the benefit of the Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.4 If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or
the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within thirty days from the date
on which the Corporation makes a written demand pursuant to Section 6.2,
then the Corporation shall use its best efforts to enforce the provisions
hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel
the surrender.

 

 

6.5 The Corporation shall make the written demand described in Section 6.2
within thirty days of the date on which the Board of Directors determines
that the attempted Transfer would result in Excess Securities; provided,
however, that if the Corporation makes such demand at a later date, the
provisions of Sections 5 and 6 shall apply nonetheless.

 

 

Section 7. Board Authority.

 

 

The Board of Directors shall have the power to determine all matters
necessary for assessing compliance with Sections 5 and 6, including, without
limitation, (A) the identification of Five-Percent Shareholders, (B) whether
a Transfer is a 5% Transaction or a Prohibited Transfer, (C) the Percentage
Stock Ownership in the Corporation of any Five-Percent Shareholder, (D)
whether an instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, (E) the amount (or
fair market value) due to a Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (y) of
Section 6.3, and (F) any other matters which the Board of Directors
determines to be relevant; and the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all the
purposes of Sections 5 and 6.

adopt such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this Restated

Stock, or selected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death,

3.2 Amendment to the Restated Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly
authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Restated Bylaws, and to adopt

(as defined in the Restated Bylaws), the Board of Directors shall not be
permitted to alter, amend or repeal Section 5.5(c), Section 5.14, the last
sentence of Section 5.6 or the proviso to Section 8.1 and (ii) no bylaws
hereafter adopted shall invalidate any prior act of the Board of Directors
that would have been valid if such bylaws had not been adopted.

 

 

ARTICLE SIXTH.

 

 

(a) A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the GCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

 

 

(b) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the GCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,
in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said
law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against
all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith. Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased
to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as
provided in paragraph (c) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a
director or officer for costs and expenses relating to proceedings (or any
part thereof) instituted against the Corporation by such director or officer
(other than proceedings pursuant to which such director or officer is seeking
to enforce such director's or officer's indemnification rights hereunder).
The right to indemnification conferred in this Article Sixth with respect to
directors and officers shall be a contract right and shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if
the GCL requires, the payment of such expense incurred by a director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director
or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit
plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such
director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Article Sixth or otherwise. The Corporation may provide
indemnification to employees (other than officers) and agents of the
Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification
of directors and officers to the extent (i) permitted by the laws of the
State of Delaware as from time to time in effect, and (ii) authorized in the
sole discretion any of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief
Financial Officer or the General Counsel of the Corporation; provided,
however, that any such indemnification shall not constitute a contract right
for any such employee or agent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If a claim under paragraph (b) of this Article Sixth is not paid in full
by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received
by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which
make it permissible under the GCL for the Corporation to indemnify the
claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall
be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or
she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the GCL, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard
of conduct.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit B-1 - 21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article Sixth shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Restated
Certificate, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

 

 

(e) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the GCL.

 

 

ARTICLE SEVENTH.

 

 

Except as expressly provided in this Restated Certificate, the Corporation
reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained
in this Restated Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
the laws of Delaware and this Restated Certificate, and all rights and powers
conferred herein upon stockholders and directors are granted subject to this
reservation.

meeting.

 

 

2.2 Special Meetings. Subject to the Restated Certificate, a special meeting
of the Stockholders may be called only by (a) both the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chairman or (b) the Board, and at an hour and date
as shall be determined by them. At any special meeting of Stockholders,
no business other than that set forth in the notice thereof given pursuant to
Section 2.4 may be transacted.

 

 

2.3 Place of Meetings. All meetings of Stockholders shall be held at
such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to
time be fixed by the Board or as specified or fixed in the

scheduled meeting of the Stockholders may be postponed by action of the Board
taken prior to the time previously scheduled for such annual meeting of

(a) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Restated Certificate
or these Restated Bylaws, at all meetings of Stockholders the presence, in
person or represented by proxy, of the holders of outstanding shares
representing at least a majority of the total voting power entitled to vote
at a meeting of Stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business; provided, however, that where a separate vote of a class or classes
or series of stock is required, the presence in person or represented by
proxy of the holders of outstanding shares representing at least a majority
of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of such class or classes
or series shall constitute a quorum thereof entitled to take action with
respect to such separate vote.

 

 

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Restated Certificate
or these Restated Bylaws, each holder of stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote on any matter at any meeting of the Stockholders shall be entitled to
one vote for each share of such stock standing in the name of such holder on
the stock ledger of the Corporation on the record date for the determination
of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting. Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, the Restated Certificate or these Restated
Bylaws, including, without limitation, Section 3.3 hereof, the affirmative
vote of a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter at a meeting
of Stockholders at which a quorum is present shall be the act of
the Stockholders. Except as required by applicable law, the method of voting
and the manner in which votes are counted shall be discretionary with
the presiding officer at the meeting.

 

 

(c) The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares entitled to vote
and present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders,
whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting to another time
and place. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present,
any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting
as originally called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the
Restated Certificate or these Restated Bylaws, no notice of an adjourned
meeting need be given.

 

 

2.7 Proxies. Each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders
may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy
executed in writing by the Stockholder or as otherwise permitted by law, or
by his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact, but such proxy shall no
longer be valid eleven months after the date of such proxy. Such proxy must
be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or his or her representative
at or before the time of the meeting.

 

 

2.8 Inspectors. The Board by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors,
which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the
Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers,
employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the
meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be
designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.
If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors
or alternates who have been appointed are unable to act, at the meeting of
Stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the DGCL. The
chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the time of the
opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the
Stockholders will vote at a meeting.

of the meeting, shall preside at all meetings of Stockholders and may
establish such rules of procedure for conducting the meetings as he or she
deems fair and reasonable. The Secretary, or in his or her absence an

other business to be considered by the Stockholders may be made at an annual
meeting of Stockholders only (A) if brought before the meeting by the
Corporation and specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting delivered
pursuant to Section 2.4, (B) if brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board or (C) if brought before the meeting by a Stockholder
who (i) was a Stockholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial
owner, if different, on whose behalf any nomination or proposal is made, only

of the Corporation) both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this
Section 2.10, and at the time of the meeting, (ii) is entitled to vote at the
meeting, and (iii) has complied with this Section 2.10 as to such

as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (as so amended and
inclusive of such rules and regulations, the "Exchange Act"), and
included in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board,
the foregoing clause (C) shall be the exclusive means for a Stockholder to
propose business to be considered or to propose any nominations of persons
for election to the Board at an annual meeting of the Stockholders.

 

 

(2)  Without qualification, for any nominations of persons for election to
the Board or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting

this Section 2.10, the Stockholder must (x) have given timely notice thereof
in writing and in proper form to the Secretary of the Corporation and (y)
provide any updates or supplements to such notice at the times and in the
forms required by this Section 2.10. To be timely, a Stockholder's notice
shall be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not more than 120 days and not
less than 90 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the
annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days, or delayed by more than 60
days, from such anniversary date, notice by the Stockholder to be timely must
be so delivered, or mailed and received, not later than the close of business
on the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date
of such annual meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall
any adjournment of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a
new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Stockholder's
notice. For purposes of this Section 2.10, the term "Proposing Person" means

business proposed to be brought before a meeting, (ii) the beneficial owner
or beneficial owners, if different, on whose behalf the proposed nomination
or other business proposed to be brought before a meeting is made, and (iii)

of paragraph (a)(3) of this Section 2.10) and (y) provide any updates or
supplements to such notice at the times and in the forms required by
paragraph (a)(4) of this Section 2.10. To be timely, a Stockholder's notice

date of such special meeting and (y) the tenth day following the day on which
public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of
the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such special meeting. In
no event shall any adjournment of a special meeting or the announcement
thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving
of a Stockholder's notice as described above.

This Section 2.10 is expressly intended to apply to any business proposed to
be brought before a meeting of Stockholders other than any proposal made
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Nothing in this Section 2.10

otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate, and subject to any other

an assignment in writing on the back of the certificates or by written power
of attorney to sell, assign and transfer the same with reasonable assurances
given that such endorsement is genuine and that all applicable taxes thereon
have been paid, signed by the record holder thereof; but no transfer shall
affect the right of the Corporation to pay any dividend upon the stock to the
holder of record thereof, or to treat the holder of record as the holder in
fact thereof for all purposes, and no transfer shall be valid, except between
the parties thereto, until such transfer shall have been made upon the books

substitute certificate shall furnish to the Corporation and to such of its
