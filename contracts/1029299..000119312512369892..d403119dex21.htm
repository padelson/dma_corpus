Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to _Section 6.2(a)_, the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Sub in effect

(each a " _Law_ ") and this Agreement.

Section 1.6 _Board of Directors and Officers_. The directors of Sub and the
officers of Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from

death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 

Section 1.7 _Effects of Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth

\- 2 -  ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or any holders of shares of capital
stock of the Company:

(i) Each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") that is held in the treasury of the
Company or by any Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 9.12_) of the Company
and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the " _Excluded Company Shares_
");

(ii) Each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (the " _Class A Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; and

(iii) Subject to  _Section 2.3_, each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive from Parent an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
$13.00 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Common Stock, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired, and, subject to  _Section 2.3_, each holder of a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing any such
shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest.

(b) Each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become at the
Effective Time one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Merger
Consideration to be paid and delivered to Securityholders (as defined in
_Section 2.2(b)_) under this Article II in exchange for (i) the Certificates
or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "). Parent will
enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means any
day of the year on which national banking institutions in New York are open to
the public for conducting business and are not required or authorized to
close.

 



\- 3 -  (b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which the holders of all shares of Common Stock (other than
Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) and excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, holders of Options (as defined in _Section 2.7(a)_) and
Restricted Stock Awards (as defined in _Section 2.7(b)_) (collectively, the "
_Securityholders_ ") will become entitled under this Article II at the
Effective Time (such amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the Securityholders
and (ii) promptly applied to making the payments provided for in this Article
II. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided
for herein. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of
America or obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and
interest, or a combination thereof. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be kept in the Exchange Fund and will, at
Parents discretion, be distributed to Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such funds) that
remains undistributed to the Securityholders one (1) year after the Effective
Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent at such time. Thereafter,
Securityholders shall look only to Surviving Corporation (subject to the
terms of this Agreement and to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as a general creditor for payment of the consideration payable to them
under this Article II, without interest, upon the surrender of any
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.

(c) As soon as practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business Days)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Securityholder of record (other than the Company, Parent, Sub, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or holders of Dissenting Company Shares (as defined
in _Section 2.3_) who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of
appraisal): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the Paying
Agent and shall be in a form reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company
prior to the Closing), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate (or delivery
of such customary affidavits and indemnities with respect to a lost
Certificate which the Paying Agent and/or the Companys transfer agent may
reasonably require pursuant to _Section 2.9_) for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt
of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, such Securityholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted

 



\- 4 -   pursuant to _Section 2.1_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share
shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than any Excluded Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares), as applicable, shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, including _Section 2.2_ hereof, to the contrary, shares of Common
Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by holders who have properly exercised appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Company Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares will be entitled
to receive payment of the value of such shares determined in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, the
Dissenting Company Shares held by such holder will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Upon the Companys receipt
of any notice of intent to demand payment in accordance with the provisions of
the DGCL, or any withdrawal of such notice, the Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable provide Parent with a copy of such notice. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or pursuant to a
valid court order, make any payment with respect to any such election to
dissent or offer to settle or settle any such election to dissent.

 

Section 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates and in
respect of Book-Entry Shares, in each case in accordance with the terms
hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificates
and/or such Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

Section 2.5 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

 



\- 5 -  Section 2.6 [Reserved]

 

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

(a) Each option (individually, an " _Option_ " and collectively, the "
_Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under any
Company stock option or equity incentive plan (" _Company Stock Plan_ "),
whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall be canceled at the Effective
Time and each holder of an Option will become entitled to receive, for each
share of Common Stock subject to such Option, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
per share exercise price of such Option.

(b) Each restricted stock award (individually, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ "
and collectively, the " _Restricted Stock Awards_ ") granted by the Company
under any Company Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the
Effective Time and shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive,
for each Restricted Stock Award an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Merger Consideration.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay through its payroll system, to each
holder of Options and Restricted Stock Awards the cash payments subject to and
in accordance with this _Section 2.7_, through its payroll system within
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) will adopt amendments to, or make determinations with
respect to, the Company Stock Plans, individual agreements evidencing the
grant of Options or Restricted Stock Awards and Employee Benefit Plans (as
defined in _Section 3.10(a)_), if necessary, and take all other action,
without incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as it may
reasonably deem to be necessary to implement the provisions of this  _Section
2.7_. The Company shall take such action as is reasonably required to cause,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, (i) the offering period under the
Deltek Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")
ending on August 31, 2012 (the " _Final Purchase Date_ ") to be the last
offering period of the ESPP, and (ii) the termination of the ESPP effective as
of the Closing, including having the Companys Board of Directors (or a
committee thereof) adopt resolutions (if required) and take such other actions
as may be required in its reasonable discretion to provide that with respect
to the ESPP: (A) participants may not increase their payroll deductions from

otherwise resulting from the pursuit of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that events, occurrences, facts,
conditions, changes or effects referred to in clauses (a), (c) and (e) above

or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and as of their respective dates and
except as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof (or with respect
to Company SEC Documents filed or furnished after the date hereof, except as
amended or supplemented prior to the Closing Date), none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to information supplied by Parent, Sub or their
respective Subsidiaries for inclusion in any Company SEC Documents. Each of
the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents
(collectively, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "), comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of
their operations, cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods

audit adjustments and to any other adjustments set forth therein that are not
material in amount or nature).

date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

date hereof, none of the Company SEC reports is the subject of ongoing SEC
review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

(c) Since January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,

contingencies which (i) are reflected in the Company Financial Statements or
the notes thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices, (iii) would not reasonably be expected to

certifications required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ ") with respect to the Company SEC Documents. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" have the meanings ascribed to those terms under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2010 and prior to the
date of this Agreement, no director or executive officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has received any substantive complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that the Company or any of its

current or former attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents, to the
current Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any current director
or executive officer of the Company.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintained internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurances
(i) regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with the authorization of
management and directors of the Company and such Subsidiaries, and (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use

designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

 



\- 13 -   Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports. Since January 1, 2010, the Board of Directors

oral or written notification from the Companys auditors or any member of the
Companys accounting or legal staff of any "material weakness" in the

Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(g) Each Option and Restricted Stock Award was granted in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable legal requirements and was recorded on
the Companys financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently
applied, and, with respect to Options, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
such grant involved any "back dating" or "forward dating" with respect to the
effective date of grant. Further, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company
has not granted any Options at an exercise price that represents a discount
from the fair market value of the Company Common Stock underlying such Option
on the date of grant and the Company has disclosed any re-pricing of Options
in the Company Financial Statements (as defined in _Section 3.4(a)_).

supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Information Statement (as defined in _Section 6.1_) at the time the
Information Statement is mailed to stockholders of the Company will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with
respect to information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing expressly for
inclusion in the Information Statement. The Information Statement shall comply
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

this Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
operations in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, (ii)

all other events, had had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) there has not been any action taken by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement, would constitute a breach of _Section 5.1_. 

Section 3.7 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, arbitration, proceeding,
claim, charge, regulatory or accrediting agency investigation or other
proceeding seeking specific

 



\- 14 -   performance or money damages in excess of $1,000,000 (each, a " _Proceeding_
") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company (as defined in _Section
9.14_), threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that no
representation is made in this _Section 3.7_ as to matters relating to
infringement, dilution, misappropriation or other violation of Intellectual
Property rights (it being understood that all representations relating thereto
are set forth in _Section 3.13(d))_. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any writ, judgment, settlement agreement,
injunction or decree that would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is not currently
any internal investigation or inquiry being conducted by the Company, the
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any third party or Governmental Entity at the request of any of the
foregoing concerning any financial, accounting, tax, conflict of interest,
self dealing, fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or
malfeasance issues, in each case that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.8 _No Violation of Law_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or since June 30, 2012 has been, in violation of any Law,
except for violations which would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no material
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, franchises, variances,
exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and
approvals necessary to conduct its businesses in all material respects as
presently conducted (collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), except for
those the absence of which would not be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of the terms of any Company Permit, except which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company

Effective Time funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and
to pay all fees and expenses relating to the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists which would result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default (or an event or circumstance which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by Parent or Sub
under the Commitment Letters, and neither Parent nor Sub has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Commitment Letters will not be
satisfied or that the Commitment Letters will not be available to Parent and
Sub on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment and
other fees that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the
date hereof in connection with the Commitment Letters and has otherwise
satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the date
hereof, and Parent will pay when due all other commitment fees arising under
the Commitment Letters as and when they become payable. Parent and Sub
acknowledge that Parents and Subs obligation to consummate the Merger is not
contingent on Parents or Subs ability to obtain any financing prior
to consummating the Merger.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the date
of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, any Debt Commitment Letter
may be amended, supplemented, modified, or any provision thereof waived or
superseded by written amendments to or agreements (in each case, whether by
amendment, supplement, modification or superseding agreement, the "
_Alternative Commitment Letters_ ") replacing the existing Debt Commitment
Letter, if and only if any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement: (x) does not reduce (and could not have the effect of reducing)
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would cause
Parent and Sub to not have sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and to pay all fees and expenses relating to the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on
the Effective Date and (y) does not impose and could not reasonably be
expected to impose any new or additional conditions or otherwise expand,
amend, or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing or that
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any provisions in the Debt

 



\- 34 -   Commitment Letter or definitive documents relating thereto in a manner that
does or could reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent or make less
likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the date of the Closing or (B) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters or definitive documents relating thereto (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, where such risk of failure to fund results from the
substitution of alternative lenders ; provided that, subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this _Section 4.5(c)_, Parent and Sub may amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners
and agents or to reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles
to, or between or among, any entities party thereto). In such event, (i) the
term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in question or
that are amended, supplemented, modified, or superseded in accordance with
this _Section 4.5(c)_ and any Alternative Commitment Letters entered into in
accordance with this _Section 4.5(c)_ to the extent then in effect, and (ii)
the term "Debt Financing" as used herein shall mean the debt financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters as amended, modified or superseded in
accordance this _Section 4.5(c)_. Parent shall (i) deliver to the Company a
substantially complete, advance copy of any such amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement at least 24 hours prior to execution
(provided, that in no event shall such notice be delivered less than one
Business Day prior to execution), and (ii) promptly deliver to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of any such amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement following execution.

 

Section 4.6 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent (as defined in  _Section 9.14_), threatened against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to materially impair the ability of Parent or Sub to perform their
obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby. None of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any writ, judgment, injunction or decree
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.7 _Brokers and Finders_. No broker, investment banker or other
person, other than the Company Financial Advisor is entitled to any brokers,
finders or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent or Sub.

Section 4.8 _Labor and Employment Matters_. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Sub has: (a) entered into any employment agreement with any of the
Companys directors, officers or employees, (b) offered employment to any of
the Companys directors, officers or employees, (c) had discussions with any
of the Companys directors, officers or employees regarding the future terms
of their employment after the Closing, or (d) sold, or offered to sell, any

Stock.

 



\- 35 -  Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions
to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger and (ii) the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III hereof, after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Securityholders pursuant
to Article II, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and payment of all related fees and expenses, and assuming the Company is
Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to any
obligations which may be accelerated as a result of consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

 

Section 4.11 _The Guaranty_. In respect to the Guaranty, (a) the Guarantor has
all limited partnership power and authority to execute, deliver and perform

the Guarantor has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all
necessary limited partnership action, and no other proceedings or actions on
the part of the Guarantor are necessary therefor, (c) the Guaranty has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and
legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against the Guarantor
in accordance with its terms, (d) the execution, delivery and performance by
the Guarantor of the Guaranty do not and will not (i) violate the
organizational documents of the Guarantor, (ii) violate any applicable Law,
rule, regulation, decree, order or judgment binding on the Guarantor or its
assets, or (iii) result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
any benefit under, any contract or agreement to which Guarantor is a party,
and (e) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its
obligations under the Guaranty, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to
fulfill its obligation under the Guaranty will be available to the Guarantor
for so long as the Guaranty remains in effect.

the representations and warranties expressly contained in this Agreement, the
Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Sub or any other Person on behalf of
Parent or Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warrant
with respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or any other matter or with respect to any other information
provided or made available to the Company, and that all such representations
and warranties, other than the representations and warranties of Parent and
Sub expressly contained in this Agreement, are expressly disclaimed. Neither
Parent, Sub nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty with
respect to any such information, including any information, projections,
forecasts, confidential information memoranda or management presentations in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
the foregoing limitations shall not (i) apply to Parent or Sub to the
extent Parent or Sub makes the specific representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement, but always subject to the limitations and restricts

advantageous to the directors and officers than the current policies) for a

reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith.

(e) In the event of any Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought

under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any other organizational
documents of the Company or

 



\- 43 -   any of its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification arrangement in existence

of the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit
any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by providing information in a manner designed to knowingly
encourage) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
confidential information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party for the purpose of
knowingly facilitating or encouraging (or which could reasonably be expected
to facilitate or encourage) an Acquisition Proposal, (C) grant any waiver,
amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement
or Takeover Statute, or (D) approve, endorse or enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that is intended to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or requires the Company to abandon this Agreement (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") and (iii) neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (A) adopt, approve
or recommend or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise)
an Acquisition Proposal, (B) fail to publicly recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal to the extent the Acquisition Proposal remains
outstanding, or (C) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject
to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act within ten Business Days
after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal (any action described in
the foregoing clauses (A) through (C), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the
determination by the Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the disclosure by the Company of such
determination or (3) the delivery by the Company of the notice required by
the last sentence of this _Section 6.3_ shall constitute an Adverse

 



\- 44 -   Recommendation Change). In addition, and except as permitted by this
_Section 6.3_, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, cease
immediately any existing discussions or negotiations regarding any Alternative
Proposal. With respect to any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with which such discussions or negotiations
have been terminated, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to promptly
require such Person or group to promptly return or destroy, in accordance with
the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, any non-public
information furnished by or on behalf of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.3(a)_, if on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on September 15, 2012, the Company or any of its Representatives has
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from an unaffiliated Third
Party, which was not initiated or solicited in breach of this _Section 6.3_,
then, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on September 25, 2012,
the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i)
engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its
Representatives and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, provided that the
Company shall make available to Parent any material non-public information
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made available to such
Third Party which was not previously made available to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is made available to such Third
Party; provided, however, that prior to taking any action described above in
this _Section 6.3(b)_, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company
shall determine in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Stock under applicable Law and (B)
the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith, based on
the information then available and after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal. Without modifying the generality of the
foregoing, in making such determinations the Board of Directors of the Company
shall take into consideration, among other factors: (x) whether such Third
Party is reasonably likely to have adequate sources of financing or adequate
funds to consummate such Acquisition Proposal and (y) whether such Third Party
has given reasonable assurances that it will not propose obtaining financing
or stockholder approval of such Third Partys stockholders as a condition to
its obligation to consummate such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide any commercially sensitive non-public information to any competitor
in connection with the actions contemplated by this _Section 6.3(b)_ in a
manner consistent with the Companys past practice in dealing with the
disclosure of such information in the context of competition
sensitive Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall require any Person
submitting an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to provide a form of definitive
agreement and, if they propose to use a revised version of this Agreement,
that marks any proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"

 



\- 45 -   communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided, however, the Company shall not
effect or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which
constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change unless specifically permitted by
this _Section 6.3_.

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the Third Party making, and
the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements), and the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal (including any
amendments thereto and any change in the Companys intentions as previously
notified) and shall provide copies of all correspondence and other written
materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Representatives
relating to any such material developments, discussions or negotiations.

 

(e) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B)
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, (C) the Company shall have complied with its
obligations under this  _Section 6.3_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal, (D) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least three
Business Days before taking such action, of the determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and of its intention to take such action, attaching the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal
is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making such
Superior Proposal and, during such three Business Day period, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, which adjustments shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this
Agreement that would, upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on Parent and
Sub, and (if applicable) the Financing Commitment Letters and/or the
Guaranty, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notification from the Company and a new three
Business Day period under this _Section 6.3(e)_).

(f) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes any
action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this
_Section 6.3_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this
_Section 6.3_.

(g) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(as defined in _Section 6.4_);

 



\- 46 -  (ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ inquiry proposal
or offer from any Third Party relating to any (A) acquisition of assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but

more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the
Companys revenues on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition
of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning
20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock (D) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company; in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (E) any other transaction the
consummation of which would reasonably be expected to interfere with or
prevent the Merger;

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock
or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and after taking into consideration, among other
things, all of the material terms, conditions, impact and all material legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and
this Agreement, including financing, regulatory approvals, shareholder
litigation, identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal
(including whether stockholder approval of such Third Party is required), and
breakup fee and expense reimbursement provisions, that such Acquisition
Proposal would be, if consummated, more favorable to the holders of Company
Stock (in their capacity as such) than the Merger (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.3(e)_);

(iv) " _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL, a rights agreement or "poison pill" arrangement and any other takeover,

officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts, commitments and
records; provided, however, that (a) such access shall not unreasonably
disrupt the Companys operations, (b) such access will comply with all
applicable Laws and all applicable real property leases regarding the premises
and shall not include any intrusive testing or environmental sampling of any
kind, and (c) no such access shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or
limit

 



\- 47 -   any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the parties under
this Agreement and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other
aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives
may reasonably request. Upon request of Parent, a representative from the
Company shall meet with representatives of Parent as soon as practicable
after the close of every calendar month for a period beginning as of the date
of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, to discuss the financial
results of the Company for such calendar month. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 6.4_, the Company shall not be required to
provide any access or information which (i) it reasonably believes it may not
provide Parent or Sub by reason of applicable Law (including antitrust,
security and/or privacy Laws), (ii) constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, (iii) upon the advice of the Companys outside
legal counsel would result in a breach of a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound, or (iv) is related to the Companys sale
process. The parties will use reasonable efforts, if legally permitted, to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be subject to the

Section 6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(i) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiary Deltek Danmark A/S to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to, obtain a written consent to the Merger and related transaction from the
licensor under each of the contracts specified in Section 6.5(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) each of the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (a) the obtaining of all Consents and the making of all

taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain such Consents and
to make such Registrations, (b) the obtaining of all other necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (c) the defending of any
lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (d) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
obligations set forth in this sentence shall not be deemed to have been
breached as a result of actions taken by the Company expressly permitted
under  _Section 6.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent or Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
shall be obligated to amend or waive the provisions of any Contract, or to pay
any consent or similar fees or payments unless such action is conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, none of
the parties shall take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied or to delay or prevent consummation of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



\- 48 -  (b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company undertakes
and agrees to file as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to ten (10)
days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate impediments under
any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by
the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable and shall defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party,
including appeals. The Company shall agree if, and solely if, requested by
Parent, to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the businesses, services, assets, properties, products,
product lines, or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
interest therein; provided, however, that any such action shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any material
communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable
Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any of the foregoing, (ii) to the extent practicable, not
agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and
(iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger or any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement and the Merger.

 

Section 6.6 _Benefit Plans_.

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending not less than
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation (i) to at least maintain the base salary or base wages
and non-equity based target incentive compensation of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the United States (and, subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 6.6(a)_, outside of the United States) who are
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing
Date and remain so employed during such period (the " _Continuing Employees_
"), and (ii) to either (x) at least maintain the Employee Benefit Plans and
Foreign Plans (in each case, other than equity-based benefits) in effect on
the date of this Agreement or (y) to provide employee benefits (other

 



\- 49 -   than equity-based benefits) to Continuing Employees that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided under the Employee Benefit Plans
or Foreign Plans, as applicable, on the date of this Agreement, but excluding
from such comparability requirement all equity-based compensation and
benefits, change in control arrangements. With respect to any Continuing
Employees based outside of the United States, the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall be modified to the extent
necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such employees are based.

 

(b) In addition to the agreement set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to honor the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Employee Benefit Plans and the Material Employment
Agreements in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on
the date of this Agreement), and the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall perform the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under such Employee Benefit Plans and Material Employment Agreements,
including, without limitation, the Companys severance, retention, change in
control and bonus plans and policies, provided that for purposes of this
provision, the words "in an amount or having a value in excess of $250,000 per
year or $1,000,000 in the aggregate" in the definition of Material Employment
Agreement will not be given effect. In addition, the Surviving Corporation
shall assume the obligations of the Company under all existing indemnification
agreements between the Company and its directors, officers and employees.

(c) To the extent that Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including any severance plan), then for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and benefit computation (but
not for purposes of early retirement subsidies or benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan or for any purpose under any equity-based plan or
management incentive compensation arrangement), service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent that such
service was taken into account by the Company and its Subsidiaries under any
analogous Employee Benefit Plan; provided, however, that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits or compensation. In addition, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be necessary so
that all health benefit plans in which Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs shall waive
any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation by and coverage of such employees in the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or
incurred on or before the Effective Time by or on behalf of any such
employees shall be taken into account under applicable Parent health benefit
plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions. 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_, express or implied, (i) is
intended to confer upon any Person (including any Continuing Employee) any
right to employment or continued employment or any particular term or
condition of employment, or

 



\- 50 -   shall constitute an establishment of any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract or arrangement, (ii) shall be construed to limit
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract or
arrangement at any time assumed, sponsored , maintained or contributed to by
any of them, or (iii) is intended to confer upon any Person (including any
Continuing Employee) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
(including any third-party beneficiary rights under this Agreement) under or
by reason of this _Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) _Company Termination Fee._ Subject to _Section 6.7(d)_, the Company
agrees to pay Parent a fee equal to $32,100,000 (the " _Company Termination
Fee_ ") less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent
pursuant to _Section 6.7(f)_, if any, if:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by (x) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_
or (y) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ (Superior Proposal) (the fee
shall be payable at the time of termination); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)
_(Company Breach) or Section 8.1(e) (Information Statement) or by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Termination Date),
and, in all such cases, after the date hereof, an Acquisition Proposal (which,
for purposes of this _Section 6.7(b)(ii)_, shall have the meaning set forth
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in _Section 6.3(g)_,
except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references to "50%") for the
Company had been made publicly (other than by Parent or its Affiliates) and
within twelve (12) months after such termination the Company has entered into
a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal for the Company (in
each case, the fee shall be payable within two (2) Business Days after
Company has entered into a definitive agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal).

(c)  _Expense Reimbursement._ In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c) _(Company Breach) under circumstances in which
the Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_,
then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly
(in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay up to $2,000,000 of Parents
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;
provided, however, that the existence of circumstances which could require the
Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not relieve the Company of its

 



\- 51 -   obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_;
and provided, further, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this  _Section 6.7(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
6.7(b)_ except to the extent set forth indicated in _Section 6.7(b)_.

 

(d) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event (A) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(g)_ (Parent Breach) (but only if the
failure to satisfy the condition specified therein results from an intentional
breach by Parent or Sub of any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein) or (B) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_, Parent and Sub shall
pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company. Parent and Sub shall pay or
cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee to the Company promptly and in
any event within two (2) Business Days following such termination, by wire
transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company.
" _Parent Termination Fee_ " means a fee equal to $59,600,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the Companys right to
seek specific performance under _Section 9.3(b)_ before demanding payment of
the Parent Termination Fee, the Companys right to receive the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 6.7(d)_ shall be of no further
force or effect if the Company makes any demand or claim for damages suffered
as a result of (i) the failure of the Merger to be consummated or (ii) a
breach or failure to perform hereunder under the Equity Commitment Letters or
otherwise in any suit, proceeding or other cause of action against any member
of the Parent Group, other than for the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee from Parent or the Guarantor. " _Parent Group_ " shall mean,
collectively, Parent, Sub, the Funding Parties, or any of their respective
former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates or assignees or
any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of
the foregoing. Parent has delivered the Guaranty to the Company in full
support of the Parent Termination Fee payment obligation.

(e) The fee payable pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 6.7_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
and Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent or Sub commences a suit which results in a
binding nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction
against the Company for the fee set forth in this _Section 6.7_, the Company
shall pay to Parent or Sub its reasonable documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

(f) Parent and Sub agree that, except as provided in _Section 9.3_, in the
event the payment provided for in _Section 6.7(b)_ is paid to Parent, Sub or
their designees, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Sub against the Company and its Representatives for any loss or
damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of the sums
stipulated in _Section 6.7(b)_. If Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 6.7(d)_, the Company agrees that its
right to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or from Guarantor

 



\- 52 -   pursuant to the Guaranty shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against
Parent and the Parent Group and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee,
neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than
one termination fee pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Company more than one Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 6.7(d)_.

 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent.
Thereafter, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing,
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it has made reasonable
efforts to do the foregoing, shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

Section 6.9 _Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Sub
to perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to
ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall not conduct any business
or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.10 _Financing; Cooperation_. 

(a) Each of Parent and Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing as soon
as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain

Registered Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has delivered the "Required
Information" at the time required for the Debt Financing, it may deliver a
notice to that effect, in which case receipt of such Required Information
shall be deemed satisfied on the date of such notice unless Parent in good
faith reasonably believes that the Company has not completed delivery of the
Required Information and, within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of
such notice by the Company, Parent delivers a written notice to the Company to
that effect (stating with reasonable specificity which Required Information
the Company has not delivered).

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions or within the timing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or

Commitment Letters from alternative lenders in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Merger. The obligations under _Sections 6.10(a)_ and _(b)_
shall apply equally to any such Alternate Commitment Letters (including any
new financing commitment). Parent shall keep Company informed on a current

Alternate Commitment Letters and shall, upon request, provide true and

seeking damages or other relief as a result of, the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") is

(a) Remedies of Parent and Sub.

(i) Specific Performance. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Parent and Sub shall be entitled to seek and
obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, including the Companys obligation to
consummate the Merger.

(ii) Company Termination Fee. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 6.7(b)_ hereof.

(iii) Parent Expenses. Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement of Parent
Expenses if and when payable under _Section 6.7(c)_ hereof.

 



\- 62 -  (iv) Termination. Parent and Sub shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VII_ I hereof.

(v) Damages. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall Parent, Sub
or any of their respective equityholders, officers, directors, employees,
agents, controlling persons, assignees or Affiliates of any of the foregoing
have the right to seek or obtain money damages from the Company under this
Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
other than the right of Parent and Sub to payment of the Company Termination
Fee or Parent Expenses as set forth in _Sections 9.3(a)(ii)_ and _(a)(iii)_
above.

 

(b) Remedies of the Company.

(i) Specific PerformanceClosing. Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof, the Company shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
remedies to enforce Parents and Subs obligations and rights to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing), and Parent and Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section 1.2_, (ii) the Debt Financing (or, if an Alternative Commitment
Letter is being used in accordance with this Agreement, such alternative
financing) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent and Parents sources of
Debt Financing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in this _Section 9.3(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and any other remedy (including payment of the
Parent Termination Fee).

(ii) Specific PerformanceOther Covenants. Prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and other than as it relates to the
right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger
(which are governed by the provisions of _Section 9.3(b)(i)_), the Company
shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Sub
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, but
not limited to demanding Parent and Sub to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain funding under the Debt Financing).

(iii) Parent Termination Fee. The Company shall be entitled to payment of the
Parent Termination Fee if and when payable under _Section 6.7(d)_ hereof.

 



\- 63 -  (iv) Termination. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_ hereof.

(v) Damages; Expenses. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective equityholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, controlling persons, assignees or
Affiliates of any of the foregoing have the right to seek or obtain money
damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) from Parent or Sub under this Agreement other than the
right of the Company to payment of the Parent Termination Fee as set forth in
_Section 9.3(b)(iii)_ above. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter to the contrary, in no event shall the
Financing Parties have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective equityholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents, controlling persons or assignees or Affiliates
of any of the foregoing relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Debt Financing; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 9.3(b)(v)_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and
obligations of Parent, Sub or the Financing Parties under the Debt Commitment
Letter or Parents or Subs obligations under this Agreement. In addition to
the rights of Parent and Sub hereunder, Parent and Sub shall be entitled, at
Parent and Subs sole election, to settle any claims arising from or relating
to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(c) Money Damages Not Adequate. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions under this Agreement to
which the right of specific performance is applicable were not performed in
