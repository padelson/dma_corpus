REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

 

 

Sellers jointly and severally represent and warrant to Purchasers that the
statements contained in this Article IV are correct and complete as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

 

4.1 Organization, Standing. Each Seller and Foreign Subsidiary is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the state or jurisdiction of its organization, is qualified to do business
in every jurisdiction in which it is required to be qualified and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority, and with respect to CAPL
only, licenses, consents and approvals to own, lease and operate its
respective properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified, and with respect to CAPL only, licensed and
approved, to do business, in good standing or with active status as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification and with respect to CAPL only, license, consent and approval,
and is not in default or violation of, with respect to CAPL only, any such
license, consent and approval, or any provision of its articles of
association or bylaws or equivalents thereof, except where the failure to be
so qualified, in good standing or to have such power or authority, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Foreign Subsidiary has provided to
the Purchasers true and complete copies of its Articles of Association and
Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended and as
currently in effect.  

 

4.2 Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.2 sets forth each Subsidiary of the Company (i)
its name and jurisdiction of organization, (ii) the number of authorized,
issued and outstanding shares for each class of its capital stock or other
equity interests and the holders thereof and (iii) the names and titles of
its officers and directors. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of each Foreign Subsidiary have been
duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2, the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries hold of record and own beneficially all of the outstanding
shares (which are fully paid up or credited as fully paid up, to the extent
applicable) of each Foreign Subsidiary free and clear of any restrictions on
transfer, Taxes, Liens, options, warrants, purchase rights, contracts,
commitments, equities, claims, and demands. Except as set forth on

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Schedule 4.2, there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
purchase rights, subscription rights, conversion rights, exchange rights, or
other contracts or commitments that could require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any capital stock or
other equity interests of any of the Foreign Subsidiaries or that could
require any Foreign Subsidiary to issue, sell, or otherwise cause to become
outstanding any of its own capital stock or other equity interest (other than
pursuant to this Agreement). There are no outstanding stock appreciation,
phantom stock, profit participation, or similar rights with respect to any
Foreign Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2, there are no voting
trusts, proxies, or other agreements or understandings with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of any Foreign Subsidiary. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.2, no Seller or Foreign Subsidiary controls directly or indirectly
or has any direct or indirect equity participation in any corporation,
partnership, trust, or other business association that is not a Subsidiary of
the Company. With respect to Germany, the shareholder list of each
German Subsidiary, as filed with the respective Subsidiary's commercial
register, is true and correct. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2,
no Seller, nor any Foreign Subsidiary owns nor has any right to acquire,
directly or indirectly, any outstanding capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, any Person. No request or declaration has been made with a view
to the judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial
liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) of any of the Foreign Subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of France (the "French Subsidiaries"), none of
the French Subsidiaries has been or is subject to any judicial or amicable
procedure of bankruptcy (in particular any reglement amiable or procedure de
sauvegarde), insolvency, receivership, winding-up or liquidation (whether
voluntary or involuntary) or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with
its available assets (etat de cessation des paiements). No Seller or Foreign
Subsidiary has given or agreed to give any unlawful assistance in connection
with any acquisition of its or any other company's share capital (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any actions by Purchasers or any Seller or
Foreign Subsidiary relating to any exit financing, including the Debt
Financing on behalf of or at the request of Purchasers with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or the financing thereof).

 

 

4.3 Validity of Agreement; Power. Subject to any necessary authorization
from the Bankruptcy Court, each Seller party hereto has full power and
authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
All Transaction Documents to which any Seller is a party have been duly
executed and delivered by such Person, except such Transaction Documents that
are required by the terms hereof to be executed and delivered by such Person
after the date hereof, in which case such Transaction Documents will be duly
executed and delivered by such Person at or prior to the Closing,
and, subject to any necessary authorization from the Bankruptcy Court,
all Transaction Documents constitute, or will constitute, as the case may be,
the valid and binding agreements of Sellers, as applicable, enforceable
against Sellers in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability,
to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

no Purchaser shall be required to commence or defend any Proceeding or to
divest, dispose of or hold separate any assets or any business to secure HSR
Act clearance or consents, approvals or waivers and (ii) no Seller or
Foreign Subsidiary shall agree to any divesture or disposal of any assets or

correspondence, filings, and written communications (and non-privileged
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members or their respective staffs, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement. Each party shall (x) respond as
promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received
from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or
documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust
matters relating to this Agreement and (y) not extend any waiting period

examination of the Books and Records and financial condition of the U.S.
Operating Subsidiaries and Foreign Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests and
to make extracts and copies to the extent necessary of such Books and
Records; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall
affect any representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such access shall be subject to
any existing confidentiality agreements. Purchasers, their lenders, if any,
and their representatives (a) shall not be entitled to access
any information, the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law and (b)
shall, at Sellers' request, enter into any reasonable arrangements with
Sellers intended to maintain the privilege of any information containing

by Sellers; provided, that Sellers shall not owe or pay any such taxes or any
other items described in this Section 6.7(b) if and to the extent that such
taxes or items have been included in Unpaid Taxes and have therefore reduced
Purchase Price. Any taxes or items included in Unpaid Taxes as described in
the preceding sentence shall be timely paid by Purchasers.

 

 

(c) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or

information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and records that
are listed as Excluded Assets under Section 2.2 hereof with respect to Tax
matters relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the business affairs of Sellers are wound-up. Each party agrees to give
the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying

take possession of such books and records.

six months pay for all employees, if any, "adversely affected" by the
transfer in ownership if there is a failure to provide notice of certain
events to such union, shall be waived for purposes of this Transaction.
Purchasers will reasonably cooperate with Sellers in regards to this
obligation.  

 

6.9 Pension Actions. Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (i) the applicable U.K. Trustee to execute and deliver the Memoranda
of Understanding and (ii) to obtain clearance that the matters contemplated
in this Agreement and the Memoranda of Understanding will not lead to the

fiduciaries, administrators and other third-party service providers as may be
necessary to administer the VEBA and the Retiree Medical Plan in accordance
with the requirements of the Code, ERISA, and the terms of the VEBA and the
Retiree Medical Plan until all benefits to which participants and
beneficiaries thereunder are entitled have been paid and shall require such
trustees, fiduciaries, administrators and other third-party service providers
to require any Persons electing to receive coverage under the Retiree Medical
Plan to release

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Purchasers and their Affiliates from any obligation to provide COBRA coverage
to such persons; provided, however, that the refusal of any such Person to
provide such release, shall not constitute a breach of this Section 6.11 or
any other covenant of Sellers under this Agreement.

 

 

6.12 Top-Hat Filings. The Company shall file a statement (pursuant to
29 C.F.R. 2520.104-23) declaring that the Chesapeake Corporation Officers'

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

representations or warranties (other than as a result of an event, condition
or development first occurring after the date of this Agreement) or a
material breach of any of the covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach is not cured within

have entered an order approving the Bidding Procedures Order by no later than
the fourteenth (14th) day (or if such date is not a business day, the
immediately following business day) following the Commencement Date (or such
later date as the Purchasers may determine in their sole discretion), or (B)
following the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order but prior to the entry of

effect, or is revoked, rescinded, vacated, materially modified, reversed or
stayed or otherwise rendered ineffective by a court of competent
jurisdiction;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) by Purchasers as a result of the failure of Sellers to require that Bids

full force and effect, or is revoked, rescinded, vacated, materially
modified, reversed or stayed or otherwise rendered ineffective by a court of
competent jurisdiction;  

 

(m) by Purchasers on any day on or after eleven (11) days (or if such date is
not a business day, the immediately following business day) following the
entry of an order approving the Sale Order if the Closing shall not have been
consummated by such date (or by such later date as shall be mutually agreed
to by Purchasers and Sellers in writing), unless the Closing has not occurred
due to a material failure of Purchasers to perform or observe their
respective agreements as set forth in this Agreement required to be performed
on or before the Closing Date; provided, that if the sole reason Closing
shall not have occurred is the failure to obtain all required approvals under
Section 7.1(a), then the date on which Purchasers may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(m) shall be extended by the lesser of
30 days or two business days after such approvals are obtained; and

 

 

(n) by Purchasers as a result of the failure of Sellers to have paid the

8.2 Breakup Fee and Expense Reimbursement.

 

 

(a) (x) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchasers pursuant to Section

cash) to Purchasers on the earlier of (i) the date of closing of an

(the "Breakup Fee") less the Expense Reimbursement payable in connection
with such termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and (y) if this Agreement
is terminated by Purchasers pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(h),
Sellers shall pay (in cash) to Purchasers on the date of such termination an
amount equal to the Breakup Fee less the Expense Reimbursement payable in
connection with such termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b), in each of
clauses (x) and (y), with Sellers being jointly and severally liable for

the contrary, the Breakup Fee shall not be payable to Purchasers if this
Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 8.1(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Sellers shall
immediately pay (in cash) to Purchasers an amount equal to (i) all Purchaser

with the Sellers being jointly and severally liable for such payment

 

 

(c) Subject to Section 10.11, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by Sellers pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Purchasers shall take any action
reasonably requested by Sellers in order to effect the assignment (the
"Purchaser Revolver Assignment") in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Facility, for no additional consideration, of the notes payable or other
documentation representing the right to receive payments of principal and
interest with respect to the Revolving Loan Commitment of their respective
Affiliates in an aggregate amount of $24,796,365.48, to the Sellers as
liquidated damages.  

 

(d) Sellers' obligation to pay the Breakup Fee and the Expense Reimbursement,
and Purchasers' obligation to deliver, or cause to be delivered, the
Purchaser Revolver Assignment, pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall
survive termination of this Agreement. Any Expense Reimbursement that
becomes payable under Section 8.2(b) shall constitute a superpriority claim
with priority over (a) any and all administrative expenses of the kind
specified in sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code except for the
secured or superpriority administrative expense claims of the DIP Lenders,
the DIP Agent or the Carve-Out arising pursuant to the DIP Facility, any
other of the DIP Documents or any DIP Financing Order and (b) secured claims
and postpetition adequate protection claims of any of the Prepetition Secured
Parties under the Credit Facility and the documents entered into in
connection with the Credit Facility. Any Breakup Fee that becomes payable as
a result of Sellers having entered into a purchase agreement with one or more
purchasers (other than Purchasers) with respect to the Acquired Assets on
terms and conditions to which the DIP Lenders and each of the Prepetition
Lenders have consented shall be payable upon closing of such transaction and
shall be junior in priority to the secured or superpriority administrative
expense claims of the DIP Lenders, DIP Agent or the Carve-Out arising
pursuant to the DIP Facility, any other of the DIP Documents or any DIP
Financing Order, and shall be senior in priority to any secured claims and
postpetition adequate protection claims of any of the Prepetition Secured
Parties arising under the Credit Facility and the documents entered into in
connection with the Credit Facility. Any Breakup Fee that becomes payable
under any other circumstance set forth in Section 8.2(a)(x) or Section
8.2(a)(y) of the Agreement shall constitute a superpriority claim with
priority over any and all administrative expenses of the kind specified in
sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, except that such
superpriority claim shall be junior in priority to (a) the secured or
superpriority administrative expense claims of the DIP Lenders or DIP Agent
arising pursuant to the DIP Facility, any other of the DIP Documents or any
DIP Financing Order, (b) any secured claims and postpetition adequate
protection claims of any of the Prepetition Secured Parties arising under the
Credit Facility, the documents entered into in connection with the Credit
Facility or any DIP Financing Order and (c) the Carve-Out.

 

 

8.3 Effect of Termination or Breach. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall become null
and void and of no further force and effect, except for this Section 8.3 and
Sections 8.2, 9.11, 10.1, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.12 and 10.14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 


 

hereof. The termination of this Agreement for any cause shall not relieve any
party hereto from any Liability which at the time of termination had already
accrued to any other party hereto or which thereafter may accrue in respect
of any act or omission of such party prior to such termination. The payment
of the Breakup Fee and Expense Reimbursement pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and
Section 8.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (as liquidated damages)
of Purchasers. The delivery of the Purchaser Revolver Assignment pursuant to
Section 8.2(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (as liquidated
damages) of Sellers and their Affiliates.

 

 

 

ARTICLE IX

 

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

 

 

9.1 Employees. Subject to the requirements of any applicable collective
bargaining agreement, Purchasers shall offer employment immediately prior to
the Closing (but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing) to all active
employees of the Company or the U.S. Operating Subsidiaries employed or
engaged principally in the Business as of the Closing Date (such employees
who accept such offer of employment, the "Rehired Employees"), on terms and
conditions consistent with Section 9.2; provided, that prior to the Closing
Date Sellers have supplied Purchaser with a list of employee layoffs, by date
and location, implemented by Sellers in the 90-day period preceding the
Closing Date, such offers shall be sufficient in number and as to terms and
conditions so as not to give rise to any Seller obligations or liabilities
under the WARN Act. For the avoidance of doubt, active employees shall
exclude persons currently receiving disability benefits. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall confer upon any Rehired Employee any right to any term
or condition of employment or to continuance of employment by Purchasers or
any of their Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right
of Purchasers or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
employee, including any Rehired Employee, at any time, with or without notice
and for any or no reason, or restrict Purchasers or any of their Affiliates
in modifying any of the terms or conditions of employment of any employee,
including any Rehired Employee, after the Closing.

 

 

9.2 Employee Benefit Plans. Other than the Assumed Employee Benefit Plans,
no Purchaser shall assume any Employee Benefit Plan or any
Liability thereunder. Subject to Section 9.1, including Purchasers' right to
terminate the employment of any employee, including any Rehired Employee, at
any time, effective immediately following the Closing and except to the
extent otherwise provided by any applicable collective bargaining agreement,
Purchasers shall provide the Rehired Employees, for a period of six (6)
months after the Closing, with wages and employee benefits (other than,
to the extent not Assumed Employee Benefit Plans, any equity or equity-
related benefits, any defined benefit pension plan, any retiree health or
life insurance benefits, any nonqualified deferred compensation plan or
arrangement or severance plan or arrangement) that are substantially
equivalent to those wages and employee benefits provided to such employees by
Sellers immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (other than, to the
extent not Assumed Employee Benefit Plans, equity or equity-related benefits,
any defined benefit pension plan, any retiree health or life insurance
benefits or any nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement or
severance plan or arrangement). With respect to any such employee benefit
plan in which the Rehired Employees may be eligible to participate,
Purchasers shall: (i) in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs,
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions and
waiting periods would have been waived or would otherwise not be

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable under the analogous plans in which such employees were
participating immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) credit all deductibles
and co-pays under any of Sellers' health plans, during the applicable plan
year that includes the Closing, towards deductibles and co-pays under the
health plan of Purchasers; and (iii) recognize all service of such Rehired
Employees with Sellers for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
to the same extent taken into account under the corresponding plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed in
any way that would result in a duplication of benefits provided to any
Person. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (a) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (b) shall alter or limit the ability of
any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person (including
employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees)
any rights as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

 

9.3 WARN Act. In respect of notices and payments relating solely to events
occurring on or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall be jointly
and severally responsible for and assume all Liability for (and the Sellers
shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Purchasers harmless from and
against) any and all notices, payments, fines or assessments that become due
on or before the Closing, pursuant to any applicable Law with respect to the
employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Sellers as of or before
the Closing, including the WARN Act as defined herein. Likewise, in respect
of notices and payments under the WARN Act or relating to or arising from
events occurring after the Closing, Purchasers shall be responsible and
assume (and shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless from and against)
all Liability for any and all notices, payments, fines or assessments with
respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees employed by
Purchasers after the Closing; provided, however, that such indemnification
obligation by Purchasers shall arise only if Seller on or before the Closing
has provided a list of employees, by date and location, terminated by Seller
in the 90-day period preceding Closing.

 

 

9.4 Payroll Reporting and Withholding. Purchasers shall adopt the "standard
procedure" for preparing and filing IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements),
as described in Revenue Procedure 2004-53. Under this procedure, the
Purchasers as the successor employer shall provide Forms W-2 to all Rehired
Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by Purchasers as the
successor employer for the portion of the calendar year beginning on the day
after the Closing Date. Sellers as the predecessor employer shall provide
Forms W-2 to all Rehired Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes
withheld by Sellers for the portion of the calendar year ending on the
Closing Date. Purchasers shall adopt the "standard procedure" of Rev.
Proc. 2004-53 for purposes of IRS Forms W-4 (Employee's Withholding
Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance
Payment Certificate). Under this procedure, Purchasers shall keep on file
the Forms W-4 and W-5 provided by the Rehired Employees for the period
required by applicable Law concerning record retention. Purchasers shall
obtain new IRS Forms W-4 and W-5 with respect to each Rehired Employee.

 

 

9.5 Joint Post-Closing Covenant of Purchasers and Sellers. Purchasers and
Sellers jointly covenant and agree that, from and after the Closing Date,
Purchasers and Sellers will each

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 


 

use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or audit of the
other relating to (a) the preparation of an audit of any Tax Return of any
Seller or Purchasers for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date
and (b) any audit of any Purchaser or any audit of any Seller with respect
to the sales, transfer and similar Taxes imposed by the laws of any state
or political subdivision thereof, relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance hereof, Purchasers and Sellers
further covenant and agree to promptly respond to all reasonable inquiries
related to such matters and to provide, to the extent reasonably possible,
substantiation of transactions and to make available and furnish appropriate
documents and personnel in connection therewith. All costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Section 9.5 referred to herein shall be
borne by the party who is subject to such action.  

 

9.6 Certain Consents. If a consent of a Third Party which is required
in order to assign any Acquired Asset (or Claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom) is not obtained prior to the
Closing Date, or if an attempted assignment would be ineffective or would
adversely affect the ability of any Seller to convey its interest in question
to Purchasers, Sellers will cooperate with Purchasers and use commercially
reasonable efforts in any lawful arrangement to provide that Purchasers shall
receive the interests of any Seller in the benefits of such Acquired Asset.
Each Seller agrees to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all such consents as have not been obtained prior to such date.

 

 

9.7 Name Changes. Promptly, but in any event within fifteen (15) days, after
the Closing, each Seller shall take all necessary action to change its name
and the names of all Affiliates of Sellers to a name that does not
include the word "Chesapeake" or any other name or mark included in the
Company Intellectual Property (including any name set forth on the signature
pages to this Agreement) (collectively, the "Restricted Names"), and Sellers
agree to promptly notify Purchasers of such name change(s) and the new
name(s) chosen by each Seller and all Affiliates of Seller, as
applicable, and each Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that it shall not
change its name to the name of any Seller prior to the Closing. From and
after the effective time of the name change, Sellers and all Affiliates of
Sellers shall cease all use of any Restricted Name, including by removing all
Restricted Names from all letterhead, stationary and signage. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchasers hereby grant Sellers a revocable, non-
exclusive royalty-free license to use the "Chesapeake" name and those marks
identified in the Transition Services Agreement for the period set forth
therein solely in connection with the winding-down of the operations of the
Sellers; provided, that Sellers shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
cease all use of any Restricted Name as soon as possible after Closing.

 

 

9.8 Accounts Receivable; Collections. After the Closing, Sellers shall
permit, and hereby authorize, Purchasers to collect, in the name of Sellers,
all accounts receivable constituting part of the Acquired Assets and to
endorse with the name of any applicable Seller for deposit in any Purchaser's
account any checks or drafts received in payment thereof. Sellers shall
promptly deliver to Purchasers any cash, checks or other property that they
may receive after the Closing in respect of any accounts receivable or other
asset constituting part of the Acquired Assets.

 

 

9.9 Access to Information. Until the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date and (ii) the completion of the wind-up of the
Sellers, each party and their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

77  

 

 

 

 

 


 

representatives shall have reasonable access to, and each shall have the
right to photocopy, all of the books and records relating to the Business or
the Acquired Assets and Purchasers shall have reasonable access to, and each
shall have the right to photocopy, all of the books and records not related
to the Business, in each case including all employee records or other
personnel and medical records required by Law, legal process or subpoena, in
the possession of the other party to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required by such party in connection with the
Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities, or other matters relating to
or affected by the operation of the Business and the Acquired Assets;
provided, that Sellers shall give Purchasers 30 days advance notice of the
completion of the wind-up of Sellers. Such access shall be afforded by the
party in possession of such books and records upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours; provided, however, that (A)
any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of any party or
its Affiliates, (B) no party shall be required to take any action which
would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and (C) no party
need supply the other party with any information which such party is under a
legal obligation not to supply. The party exercising this right of
access shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this Section 9.9. If the party in possession of such books and
records shall desire to dispose of any such books and records upon or prior
to the expiration of such period, such party shall, prior to such
disposition, give the other party a reasonable opportunity at such other
party's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as such other
party may select.  

 

9.10 Confidentiality.

 

 

(a) Following the Closing, Sellers shall maintain as confidential and shall
not use or disclose (except as deemed necessary by Sellers to address any
Excluded Asset, Excluded Liability or otherwise required by Law or as
authorized in writing by Purchasers) (i) any information or materials
relating to the Business, operations and affairs of Sellers or the Foreign
Subsidiaries (other than the Excluded Assets) and (ii) any materials
developed by Purchasers or any of its representatives (including its
accountants, advisors, environmental, labor, employee benefits and any other
consultants, lenders and legal counsel). Except as otherwise permitted and
provided above, in the event any Seller is required by Law to disclose any
such confidential information, such Seller shall promptly notify Purchasers
in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall reasonably
cooperate with each Purchaser to obtain a protective order and otherwise
preserve the confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable
Law. Information subject to the confidentiality obligations in this Section
9.10(a) does not include any information which (x) at the time of disclosure
is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of
its disclosure in breach of this Agreement) or (y) becomes available on a
non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Purchaser or its Affiliates, or who is not
otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information.

 

 

(b) Following the Closing, Purchasers shall maintain as confidential and
shall not use or disclose (except as deemed necessary by Purchasers to
address any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability or otherwise required by Law
or as authorized in writing by Sellers) any information or materials relating
to the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities. Except as otherwise permitted
and provided above and to the extent that the Company has not dissolved, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the event any Purchaser is required by Law to disclose any such confidential
information, such Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers in writing, which
notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the extent
of the required disclosure, and shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers to
obtain a protective order and otherwise preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with applicable Law. Information subject to the
confidentiality obligations in this Section 9.10(b) does not include any
information which (x) at the time of   

disclosure is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a
result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement) or (y) becomes available
on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known to be bound by
a confidentiality agreement with any Seller or its Affiliates, or who is
not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information.

 

 

9.11 Tax Matters. (a) Each Purchaser shall, within 90 days after the Closing
Date, prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule allocating the Transaction
Value (and any other items that are required for federal income tax purposes
to be treated as part of the purchase price) among the Acquired Assets (such
schedule, the "Allocation"), in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law), which is subject to the reasonable approval of
Sellers. The Allocation shall identify the respective transferors and
transferees of the Acquired Assets. Once the Sellers approve the Allocation,
the Allocation shall be binding upon the Sellers and each Purchaser.
Purchasers and Sellers shall report and file all Tax Returns (including
amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the Allocation,
and shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith unless
required by applicable Law (including in any audits or examinations by any
Governmental Authority or any other proceeding). Purchasers and Sellers shall
cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Internal Revenue Service Form
8594 under section 1060 of the Code and any other forms required under state,
local or foreign law) with respect to such Allocation. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, this Section 9.11 shall survive any
termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Foreign Purchaser and the respective Sellers of the
equity securities of CAPL and Chesapeake UK Holdings Limited agree to
determine (i) the Hong Kong Value on or prior to the Closing Date in a manner
consistent with this Section 9.11 and (ii) the U.K. Value within 28 days
after the Closing Date, in order to permit the respective Seller to timely
pay any Hong Kong and U.K. stamp duty due as a result of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement. At least ten business day prior to the
Closing Date, the Foreign Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller of the equity
securities of CAPL a schedule (the "Hong Kong Value Schedule") setting forth
the Foreign Purchaser's best good faith estimate of the Hong Kong Value as of
the Closing, based upon, among other things, the latest audited accounts and
the latest management accounts of CAPL and its Subsidiaries. During the five-
business day period immediately following such Seller's receipt of the Hong
Kong Value Schedule, the Seller of the equity securities of CAPL shall be
permitted to review and comment on the Hong Kong Value Schedule. The Hong
Kong Value set forth in the Hong Kong Value Schedule shall become final and
binding upon the parties two business days following such Seller's receipt
thereof unless the Seller gives written notice of its disagreement to the
Foreign Purchaser prior to such date, and then the parties shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they have with respect to
the Hong Kong Value prior to the Closing Date. As soon as agreement of the
Hong Kong Value is reached, the Seller of the equity securities of CAPL and
the Foreign Purchaser shall executed the Hong Kong Value Memorandum prior to
the Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Foreign Purchaser indicates, for the purposes of Article 223 B,
paragraph 8-c of the French tax code, that it intends to sell the shares of
Chesapeake France SA to a newly incorporated French indirect subsidiary of
the Foreign Purchaser immediately following Closing, or as soon as possible
thereafter, unless such newly incorporated French indirect subsidiary of the
Foreign Purchaser directly purchases the shares of Chesapeake France SA.

 

 

 

(c) Sellers agree to cooperate with Purchasers to make, if allowed under law,
and upon the election of the Purchasers, any elections under § 338 of the
Code, or analogous elections allowed under foreign tax law, with respect to
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that any
such election has no material adverse tax consequences to Sellers.

 

 

9.12 Release and Indemnity.

 

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchasers and their respective Affiliates
hereby release Sellers, the officers, directors and employees of the Company
(in their capacity as such and for service provided to the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant thereto), shareholders of the Company (in their
capacity as shareholders) and non-employee agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Release Parties") from any and all Liabilities,
actions, rights of action, contracts, indebtedness, obligations, claims,
causes of action, suits, damages, demands, costs expenses and attorneys' fees
whatsoever, of every kind and nature, known or unknown, disclosed or
undisclosed, accrued or unaccrued, existing at any time, other than those
arising out of the knowing or willful fraud or criminal misconduct of such
Seller Release Party, in all circumstances, arising prior to Closing, that
any Purchaser, Foreign Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates and all such
Persons' respective successors and assigns, have or may have against any of
the Seller Released Parties (including, but not limited to, Environmental
Liabilities); provided, that the foregoing shall not release any rights under
the Transaction Documents which expressly survive Closing.

 

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Sellers hereby release Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives, the Foreign Subsidiaries and the directors of each
Foreign Subsidiary (in their capacity as such and for service provided to the
Foreign Subsidiaries pursuant thereto) (collectively, the "Buyer
Released Parties") from any and all Liabilities, actions, rights of
action, contracts, indebtedness, obligations, claims, causes of action,
suits, damages, demands, costs expenses and attorneys' fees whatsoever, of
every kind and nature, known or unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, accrued or
unaccrued, existing at any time, other than those arising out of the knowing
or willful fraud or criminal misconduct of such Buyer Release Party, that any
Seller or its respective Affiliates and all such Persons' respective
successors and assigns, have or may have against any of the Buyer Released
Parties; provided, that the foregoing shall not release any rights under the
Transaction Documents which expressly survive Closing.

and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in the Schedules hereto shall
expire with, and be terminated and extinguished at the Closing, and shall not

or to such other individual or address as a party hereto may designate for
itself by notice given as herein provided.

 

 

10.6 Waivers. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing by the Company, in the
case of a waiver by any Seller, or Purchasers, in the case of any waiver by
any Purchaser, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed to
be a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach of other
instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, but subject to Section 10.1, regardless of
Purchasers' ability to investigate the affairs of Sellers and
their Affiliates, and regardless of any knowledge of facts determined or
determinable by Purchasers pursuant to such investigation or right of
investigation, Purchasers have the right to rely on the representations and
warranties of Sellers under this Agreement and to exercise all rights and
remedies provided under this Agreement in respect thereof (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Purchasers' rights under Article VII and Article VIII).

 

 

10.7 Counterparts and Execution. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original,
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Any counterpart may be executed by facsimile signature and such facsimile
signature shall be deemed an original.

 

 

10.8 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT ANY AND
ALL CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, SUITS, AND PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN SHALL BE FILED
AND MAINTAINED ONLY IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT
TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable New York principles of conflicts
of Law) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction,
effect, performance and remedies.

 

 

10.10 Binding Nature; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto without prior written consent of the other parties (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); except (i) that each Purchaser may assign
any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate or Subsidiary of
such Purchaser (whether wholly owned or otherwise); (ii) the rights
and interests of Sellers hereunder may be assigned to a trustee appointed
under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; (iii) this Agreement
may be assigned to any entity appointed as a successor to Sellers pursuant to
a confirmed Chapter 11 plan; and (iv) as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. Sellers hereby agree that any Purchaser may grant a security
interest in its rights and interests hereunder to its lenders, and Sellers
will sign a consent with respect thereto if so requested by any Purchaser or
its lender, and that the terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon any
subsequent trustee appointed under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, upon Purchaser's
request, Sellers agree to cooperate with Purchasers to modify this Agreement
as necessary to enable Purchasers and their Affiliates to purchase one or
more Foreign Subsidiary in one or more series of transactions; provided,
that Purchasers will purchase all of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

 

 

10.11 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that Sellers shall not
be entitled to any injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
Purchasers or any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (other than Section 8.2(c)) and that the sole and exclusive
remedies of Sellers with respect to any such breach shall be the remedies set
forth in Section 8.2(c). The parties acknowledge that, in addition to the
other remedies provided in this Agreement, Purchasers shall be entitled to an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Sellers or any remedy to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

10.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the parties hereto and nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations, Claims,
or causes of action under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

10.13 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement may only be
made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto or
against the Equity Sponsors under and to the extent set forth in the Revolver
Backstop Letter. Except for the Purchasers and the Equity Sponsor (under
and to the extent set forth in the Revolver Backstop Letter), no Equity
Sponsor, nor any past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, fiduciary, shareholder,
equity holder, controlling person, trustee, general or limited partner,
financing source, agent, attorney or representative of any Equity Sponsor or
of any party hereto shall have

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

83  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any Liability for any obligations or Liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

10.14 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties to this Agreement to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
party. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and Laws promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise.

 

 

10.15 Public Announcements. Except as required by Law or in connection
with the Chapter 11 Cases, neither Sellers nor Purchasers shall issue any
press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of the other parties hereto relating to the contents and manner of
presentation and publication thereof, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Prior to making any public disclosure
required by applicable law, the disclosing parties shall give the other party
a copy of the proposed disclosure and reasonable opportunity to comment on
the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers shall not be restricted
from making any public announcements or issuing any press releases after the
Closing and Sellers shall not be restricted from making any announcements
unrelated to the Business after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Seller and Purchasers agree (on behalf of itself and
each Affiliate and Person acting on behalf of it) that each party hereto (and
each employee, representative, and other agent of any party hereto) may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax
treatment and Tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to any party
hereto or any Person relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure, except
to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state
securities laws. Each Seller and each Purchaser agree that the authorization
contained in the immediately preceding sentence is not intended to permit
disclosure of any other information, including (i) any portion of any
materials to the extent not related to the Tax treatment or Tax structure of
the transaction, (ii) the identities of participants or
potential participants in the transaction, (iii) the existence or status of
any negotiations, (iv) any pricing or financial information (except to the
extent such pricing or financial information is related to the Tax treatment
or Tax structure of the transaction), or (v) any other term or detail not
relevant to the Tax treatment or the Tax structure of the transaction.

 

 

10.16 Disclosure Schedules. The information disclosed in any numbered part
in the disclosure schedule delivered by Sellers to Purchasers on the date
hereof (the "Disclosure Schedule") shall be deemed to relate to and to
qualify only the particular representation or warranty set forth in the
corresponding numbered section in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
relate to or to qualify any other representation or warranty, unless an
appropriate cross reference is contained in such section or subsection of the
Disclosure Schedule. 

 

 

10.17 Entire Understanding. This Agreement, the Exhibits and the
Schedules set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties
hereto in respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and the Agreement,
the Exhibits and the Schedules supersede all prior agreements, arrangements
and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and are not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.18 Closing Actions. All deliveries, payments and other transactions
and documents relating to the Closing shall be interdependent, and none shall
be effective unless and until all are effective (except to the extent that
the party entitled to the benefit thereof has waived satisfaction or
performance thereof as a condition precedent to the Closing).

 

 

10.19 Setoff. Sellers agree that Purchasers have rights of setoff and may,
without duplication of the deductions set forth in the definition of
"Purchase Price", exercise such rights of setoff against any and all
obligations of Sellers pursuant to any Transaction Document (including
Sellers' obligations under Section 6.7 herein), to Purchasers.

 

 

10.20 Conflict between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement or document referred to herein, this
Agreement shall govern and control.
