AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(c) of the DGCL and shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, immunities, licenses, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 (b) Subject to _Section 5.7_, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without the necessity of further action by the Company or any other
Person, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form set forth as
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Lexmark International, Inc."), and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, subject to _Section
5.7_, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary
action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals
designated by Parent as of the Effective Time shall become the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective
Time, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time or such other individuals as are designated by Parent as of the
Effective Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the
Company, other than as permitted by _Section 5.1(b)_, shall occur as a result
of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), division or subdivision of shares or
other similar transactions, or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change.

 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to
be specified by the parties (such date and time, the " _Closing Date_ "), such
date to be no later than three (3) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver
of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square,
New York, New York 10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed in
writing by the parties hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date and
time to which

 



3  Merger Sub and the Company may agree in writing, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time
the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon
by the parties hereto in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter being
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares and Cancelled
Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to $40.50 without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to
the holder in cash, subject to any required withholding of Taxes as provided
in _Section 2.5_, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 

(b) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares of common stock of Merger Sub so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(c) _Cancelled Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly by the Company (or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company), Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a
reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity
and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be subject to the
reasonable prior written approval of the Company) for purposes of effecting
the payment of the Merger Consideration in

 



4  connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent and Merger Sub
shall enter into a Paying Agent Agreement prior to the Effective Time in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. Prior to the date on which
the Closing is to occur, Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares shall be entitled pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure
that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such payments. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_ , that any such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
government. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree upon and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration, the forms of which letter of transmittal and
instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Merger Sub, and
upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form,
with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any

 



5  time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in compliance with this
Agreement that remain unpaid at the Effective Time), except for Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right
to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to
the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more
Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or
its nominee, for the benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held
through it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal
to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust
Company (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and
the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree upon, and (B) instructions for
returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, the forms of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective
Time. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the
terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and
such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of
the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall be made only
to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such Shares in compliance with this Agreement that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time), except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting
Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of
the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



6 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Shares represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the
Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder that has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior
to such time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the
Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any required withholding
of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.5_, in respect of such holders surrender
of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
without interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes as provided
in _Section 2.5_. Merger Sub may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owner(s) of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held
by a holder that is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and that complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At
the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the
rights granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise waives, withdraws or

 



7  loses its right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes as provided in
_Section 2.5_.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, of any written
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and
Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to any
such appraisal demands.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSU Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be fully vested (to the extent unvested)
and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option by (ii)
the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option, _provided_ , that
if the exercise price of any Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any
payment therefor. Holdings, Parent or one of Parents Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within one (1)
Business Day following the Effective Time.

(b) Each award of restricted stock units or deferred stock units that
corresponds to Shares (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
as of the Effective Time, be fully vested and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the
Merger Consideration. The Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company RSU Awards the cash
amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within one (1)
Business Day following the Effective Time unless otherwise required by
Section 409A of the Code. With respect to any Company RSU Award that is
subject to performance-based vesting conditions, for purposes of clause (i) of
the first sentence of this  _Section 2.4(b)_, the total number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU Award shall be determined based on the greater of
target performance and actual performance through the date on which the
Effective 

 



8  Time occurs (extrapolating such performance through the end of the full
performance period) and pro-rating such number based on the Applicable Pro-
Ration Factor. The " _Applicable Pro-Ration Factor_ " shall mean, (A) in the
case of an award granted in 2016, one (1), and (B) in the case of an award
granted prior to 2016, the ratio of (1) the number of days from and including
the first day of the performance period through and including the Closing
Date to (2) the total number of days in the performance period.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any authorized
committee thereof will adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be appropriate
or required in its discretion to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_.

 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to
the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Document
under the headings "Forward-Looking Statements," "Risk Factors" or any similar
section, in each case, to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) or (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub concurrent with the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged
and agreed that disclosure in any section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to all sections of
this Agreement and all other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such
other section or subsection is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ " and, collectively,
the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization

 



9  and has the requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, in each case except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the
conduct or nature of its business requires such qualification or licensing,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Merger
Sub true and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") not
filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments to the By-
Laws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") not filed prior to the date
hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each of its "significant
subsidiaries" (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities
Act) (each, a " _Significant Company Subsidiary_ " _)_ , and each as so made
available is in full force and effect. The Company has not taken any action in
breach or violation of any of the material provisions of the Company Charter
and the Company Bylaws.

(c) All the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in (i) each Significant
Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens and (ii) each of the
other Company Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company,
other than Equity Interests required by applicable Law to be held by directors
and/or officers or other third parties and other than any failure to so own a
number of such Equity Interests that would not be material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company does not own, directly
or indirectly, any Equity Interests in any Person that would be material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
Company Subsidiaries and excluding (i) securities in any publicly traded
companies held for investment by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries and
comprising less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock of such
publicly traded company and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, holdings of
pension plans, 401(k) plans and other similar funds.

outstanding (excluding 36,498,485 Shares held in treasury), (ii) 10,000,000
shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Class B Common Stock_ "), of which, as of the

outstanding, and (iii) 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which, as
of the Capitalization Date, no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding. No Company Subsidiary owns any Shares or has any option or
warrant to purchase Shares or any other Equity Interest in the Company. All
of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued, are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

 

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, there were
10,521,664 Shares reserved for future issuance under the Benefit Plans. As of
the close of business on the Capitalization Date, there were (i) 852,729

Shares having an exercise price less than the Merger Consideration and the
weighted average exercise price for such in-the-money Company Options equal
to $24.38 per Share) and (ii) outstanding Company RSU Awards covering
4,890,089 Shares (assuming in the case of performance-based Company RSU
Awards, maximum performance). All Shares subject to issuance under the
Benefit Plans upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights.

(c) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, except as set
forth in  _Section 3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_, there are no outstanding
Equity Interests or other options, warrants or other rights issued by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, relating to or based on the value of any
Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or sell any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. From the close of business
on the Capitalization Date until the date of this Agreement, the Company has
not issued any Shares, Company Options, Company RSU Awards or other Equity
Interests other than Shares issued upon the exercise of any Company Options or
settlement of Company RSU Awards outstanding as of the close of business on
the Capitalization Date in accordance with their terms.

(d) Except with respect to the Company Options and Company RSU Awards
pursuant to the Benefit Plans and the related award agreements, there are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary requiring the
repurchase of, or containing any right of first refusal with respect to, or
granting any preemptive rights with respect to, any Shares or other Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) The Company does not have any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right generally to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to or bound by any shareholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements with any Third Party relating to
the voting or registration of any equity securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to

have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action.
Except for the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares at the stockholders meeting duly called and

Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to adopt this Agreement or to

(the foregoing recommendations in clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the
" _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

(b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery by
Apex, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and
to general equitable principles, including specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief).

 

3.4 _No Conflict_. None of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) conflict with or violate any provision of
the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or

notice or lapse of time, or both) (a) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and permits described in _Section 3.5_ and the Stockholder
Approval have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in

respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party or by which it or any of its respective properties or assets may be
bound or affected or any Company Permit.

3.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub in _Section
4.4_, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company or the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other

failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits of, or
to make such filings, registrations with or notifications to, any Governmental
Entity, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

3.6 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries hold all authorizations,
qualifications, licenses, permits, certificates, variances,
exemptions, consents, approvals, orders, registrations and clearances of any
Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
own, lease and operate their properties and assets, and to carry on and
operate their businesses as currently conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to hold any of the Company Permits would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
such Company Permits are in full force and effect and, as of the date hereof,
are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding pending, or to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Governmental Entity that has

Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for any conflicts, defaults or
violations as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there
is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
outstanding against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 3.6_, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this _Section 3.6_
in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 3.7(a)_ or in respect
of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or labor matters.

3.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2013, the Company has filed or otherwise furnished (as
applicable) with the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports, proxy statements, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be (such documents and any other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC, as have been supplemented, modified or amended since the
time of filing, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ " and, together
with any of the foregoing filed with the SEC after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, the " _Company Filings_ "). As of their respective
filing dates or, if supplemented, modified or amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of the most recent supplement, modification or
amendment, (i) the Company SEC Documents did not (or, with respect to each
Company Filing filed after the date hereof, will not, subject to _Section
3.23_) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading and (ii) the Company SEC Documents complied, and each
Company Filing filed after the date hereof (other than the Proxy Statement,
which is addressed by _Section 3.23_) will comply, as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and/or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder. None of the Company Subsidiaries is required as of
the date hereof, or has been required at any time since December 31, 2013, to
file statements, prospectuses, forms, periodic reports, schedules, exhibits or
any other documents, filings and materials with the SEC.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of all material correspondence between the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
any outstanding

 



14  or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff as of
the date hereof with respect to the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of
the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment.

(c) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries included in the Company Filings when filed (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been prepared in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to the absence of footnote disclosures and other presentation
items and normal year-end audit adjustments, or as otherwise permitted by
the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto) and (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position and the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders equity of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand) or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), which would
be reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.8 _Internal Controls_. The Company has designed and maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) intended to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The
Company has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required by
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company has, based on its
most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof,
disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

 



15 3.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities and
obligations (a) disclosed, reflected, reserved against or provided for in the
audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company, as of December 31, 2015, or
the notes thereto (collectively, the " _Company Balance Sheet_ ") that
is included in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, (b)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, (c) for Taxes, which are
addressed in  _Section 3.19_, (d) permitted or incurred under this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or otherwise disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (e) that
otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is, as of the date of this Agreement, subject to any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto).

 

3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the date of the Company Balance Sheet through the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, and during such period neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has undertaken or effected, or authorized
or agreed to undertake or effect, any action that, if taken or effected after
the date of this Agreement, would require Parents written consent pursuant

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Apex, Holdings,

in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its

perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions

_Parent Subsidiaries_ ") or any of their respective properties or assets or
(b) require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with, result in
any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a change of

Limited, Guangzhou Branch (together with their respective affiliates, their

including any joinder, together with the former, current or future partners,
shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives of each of the foregoing and their successor and assigns, the

the former, current or future partners, shareholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of each of the
foregoing and their successor and assigns, the " _SBLC Financing Sources_ "
and together with the Debt Financing Sources and the Equity Financing Sources,
the " _Financing Sources_ ") and Parent and each executed fee letter
associated therewith ( _provided_ , that provisions in the fee letter related
solely to fees, flex and other economic terms may be redacted to the extent
they do not affect the conditionality of the debt commitments contemplated
thereby) (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes,
supplements and amendments thereto and each such redacted fee letter,
collectively, the " _SBLC Commitment Letter_ " and together with the
Equity Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment
Letters_ "). Pursuant to the Commitment Letters, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the Financing Sources have committed to provide Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, with the amounts set forth in the
Commitment Letters (the " _Financing_ ") for purposes of financing the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated

 



32  hereby. None of the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified prior to
the date hereof, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated as of the date hereof (other than solely in
connection with the appointment of additional agents and arrangers as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or SBLC Commitment Letter). As of
the date hereof, (i) the respective commitments contained in the Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and (ii) no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under
any Commitment Letters. There are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to any Commitment Letter that
impose conditions to the funding of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters delivered to the Company on the date hereof. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ and performance by
the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate net
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters, when funded in accordance
with the applicable Commitment Letters on the Closing Date, will be sufficient
for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay and satisfy in full all
amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the Merger, including (1) the aggregate Merger Consideration
hereunder, (2) the cash consideration to be paid to holders of Company Options
and Company RSU Awards, (3) the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes, in each case,
together with the "change of control" premium and accrued interest due
thereon, to the extent applicable, (4) the Credit Agreement dated as
of January 18, 2012, as amended, among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other parties thereto and (5) all fees
and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby payable at Closing. The Commitment Letters are not
subject to any conditions precedent relating to the funding of the Financing
other than as set forth therein and, as of the date hereof, are binding and in
full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case,
except that enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally. All commitment and other fees required to be paid under the
Commitment Letters prior to the date hereof have been paid in full. Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ and
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent
has no reason to believe that the conditions to the funding contemplated by
the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be available to Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
Parent is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of
any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Article 3_ or the Companys compliance hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that a breach of the
representation and warranties in this _Section 4.12_ shall not result in the
failure of a condition precedent to the Companys obligations under this
Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach) Parent is willing and able to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date
in accordance with the terms hereof.

4.13 _Solvency_. None of Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud

 



33  either present or future creditors thereof. Assuming the satisfaction in
full of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, as of
the Closing, immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, Holdings
on a consolidated basis with Parent and the other Parent Subsidiaries
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) will be Solvent. For
purposes of this _Section 4.13_, " _Solvent_ " means that:

(a) the amount of the fair value of the assets of Holdings, Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis as of such date, exceeds, on a
consolidated basis, the amount of all liabilities of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise;

(b) the present fair saleable value of the property (on a going concern basis)
of Holdings, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability,
on a consolidated basis, of their debts and other liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute
and matured in the ordinary course of business;

(c) Holdings, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
are able to pay their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such liabilities become absolute and matured in the ordinary
course of business; and

 

(d) Holdings, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are
not engaged in, and are not about to engage in, any business or transaction
contemplated as of the date hereof for which they have unreasonably small
capital.

For purposes of this _Section 4.13_, the amount of any contingent liability
at any time shall be computed as the amount that would reasonably be expected
to become an actual and matured liability.

 

4.14 _Investigation; No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Apex,
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, Contracts, Intellectual
Property, real estate, technology, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
and each of them acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received
access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that it and its
Representatives have requested to review and that it and its Representatives
have had the opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to
discuss the business and assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Each of Apex, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes, and none of Apex,
Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub has relied upon, any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or with respect to any other information provided to Apex,
Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including the accuracy, completeness or
currency thereof other than the representations and warranties contained in
_Article 3_ (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule). Without
limiting the foregoing, each of Apex, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees 

 



34  that neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or other obligation to Apex, Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives or affiliates or any other Person resulting from Apexs,
Holdings, Parents, Merger Subs or their Representatives or affiliates use
of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Apex, Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives or
affiliates, including any information made available in the electronic data
room maintained by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, teasers,
marketing materials, consulting reports or materials, confidential information
memoranda, management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of Apex, Holdings, Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Representatives or affiliates or in any other form in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless and to
the extent any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in _Article 3_ hereof (as qualified by the Company
Disclosure Schedule).

access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes

exceptions contained therein to that which constitutes "Information"), dated
as of November 4, 2015, between the Company and Seine (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 



39 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to the other clauses of this _Section 5.3_, from and after the
date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this

any Third Party of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section
5.3_) ( _provided_ , that the Company may ascertain facts from any Person
making an Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of the Company Boards
informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal and the Third Party making
it), (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw, change or qualify, or otherwise

promptly cease and cause to be terminated any discussion or negotiation with
any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Stockholder
Approval (i) the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from a Third Party and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its advisors, based on information then available, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and its potential sources of
financing and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and its potential

the Company (1) will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to and
will instruct its Representatives not to, disclose any material nonpublic
information

 



40  to such Third Party without first entering into (or having previously
entered into) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party
and (2) will promptly (and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours)
provide to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such Third Party that
was not previously provided or made available to Parent. 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within seventy-two (72)
hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition
Proposal, and provide to Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where
no such copy is available, a reasonable description of such Acquisition
Proposal) unless such disclosure would violate any Contract by which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound as of the date hereof ( _provided_
, that the Company may redact the identity of, or any identifying facts
regarding, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within seventy-two
(72) hours after such determination) advise Parent if the Company determines
to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any
time prior to the Stockholder Approval, (i) effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and/or (ii) terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in either case subject to the requirements of this _Section
5.3(d)_. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(d)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 7.1(g)_ unless the
Company shall have provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to take
such action, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, and shall have provided to Parent a copy of the
available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect of
such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that the Company may redact the
identity of, or any identifying facts regarding, the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal if such disclosure would violate any Contract by which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound as of the date hereof), and:

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representative, to engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent and its Representatives regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments
and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) that may be irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the "
_Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the last day of the Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith,

 



41  after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days
with respect to any such revised Superior Proposal, but no such written
notice shall shorten the original Notice Period.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
5.3_, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Stockholder Approval
effect a Change of Board Recommendation if (i) the Company Board determines
that an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Prior to the Company taking such Change of Board
Recommendation, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) Business Days
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation (which notice itself will not constitute a Change of
Board Recommendation) and specifying, in reasonable detail, the circumstances
of such Intervening Event, and during such three (3) Business Day period,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, so that it would no longer be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary obligations not to effect a Change of Board Recommendation, and
shall consider in good faith any changes to this Agreement or other
arrangements that may be offered in writing by, and would be legally binding
upon, Parent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day
after the Company has provided the notice described herein and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of Board
Recommendation if such changes offered in writing by Parent in a
definitive agreement were given effect.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or violate applicable Law;  _provided_ , that this _Section 5.3(f)_
shall not permit the Company Board to make a Change of Board Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_. The
issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change
of Board Recommendation. 

 



42 5.4 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
take all such actions as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly

Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Holdings, Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to effect the
Closing by not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date,
and to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including
those in connection with the pre-merger notification obligations of the HSR
Act and the PRC Regulatory Approvals), in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iv) cause
the satisfaction of all conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , (v) defend and
seek to prevent the initiation of all actions, lawsuits or other legal,
regulatory or other Proceedings to which it is a party challenging or
affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable
Order, (vi) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order that may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final,
nonappealable Order, (vii) as promptly as practicable, make or cause to be
made all necessary applications and filings, make any other required
submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith (all such fees to be
solely the responsibility of, and to be paid by, Parent and Merger Sub), with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any Competition Laws
and (viii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make
all necessary filings (and in any event file all required HSR Act
notifications within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof), and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under any other applicable Law. The Company, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate with each other in connection with (A) preparing and filing
the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, (B) determining whether any action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and (C) seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The
Company, on the one hand, and Holdings and Parent, on the other hand, shall
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this
Agreement shall consent to any delay of the Closing at the behest of
any Governmental Entity without the prior written consent of the other
parties to this Agreement. Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, except
as may be consented to in advance in writing by the Company, directly or
indirectly through one or more of its affiliates, take any action, including
acquiring or making any investment in any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other Person or any division or assets thereof, that
would reasonably be expected to cause a delay in or jeopardize the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article 6_ or the consummation of
the Merger. Without limiting this

 



43   _Section 5.4(a)_, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use their
respective best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and
to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Competition Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later
than the Outside Date), including (1) proposing, negotiating, committing to,
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses
of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (2) accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that limit Holdings, Parents or any Parent
Subsidiarys freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any
of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or
businesses of Holdings, Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be required to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the Closing. In addition, each of Holdings,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective best efforts to
defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from
occurring as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the
Outside Date).

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding by
or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other
parties notified as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation
or other Proceeding, (iii) promptly notify the other parties of any oral or
written communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
promptly provide to the other parties copies of any written communications
received or provided by such party, or any of its Subsidiaries, from or to any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Holdings, Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other party under this
section as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties with respect to and provide any necessary
information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with
respect to all notices, submissions, or filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will permit the other
parties to review and discuss in advance and consider in good faith the views
of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as

 



44  may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding, each party hereto
will consult with the other parties in advance and give the other parties or
their authorized representatives the opportunity to be present at each meeting
or teleconference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation or
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation or Proceeding.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Apex, Holdings, Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over
its business operations.

(d) Holdings, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval.
Such reasonable best efforts shall include promptly after the date hereof
making any draft and final filings required in connection with the CFIUS
Approval in accordance with the DPA, which draft filings shall be made within
thirty (30) calendar days hereof, unless the parties hereto agree in writing
otherwise, and providing any information requested by CFIUS or any other
agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review
or investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within
the timeframes required by the DPA unless CFIUS agrees in writing to an
extension of such timeframe. Each of Holdings, Parent and the Company shall,
in connection with the efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval, (i) cooperate in all
respects and consult with each other in connection with the CFIUS Notice,
including by allowing the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to

promptly inform the other party of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, CFIUS, by promptly providing copies to the
other party of any such written communications and (iii) permit the other
party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call or
conference with CFIUS, and to the extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings with CFIUS. With respect to Holdings and Parent, such reasonable best
efforts shall also include agreeing to any action, condition or restriction
required by CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval, including the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses
of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates and any operational restrictions or otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that limit Holdings or Parents or any
Parent Subsidiarys or Parents affiliates freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of Holdings, Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event that CFIUS notifies in writing Holdings, Parent and the Company that
CFIUS (A) has completed its review or investigation or has determined that it
requires no more time to review or investigate and (B) intends to send a
report to the President of the United States recommending that the President
act to suspend or prohibit the Merger (a " _CFIUS Turndown_ "), Parent may
request a withdrawal of the notice filed with CFIUS in 

 



45  connection with the CFIUS Approval and none of Holdings, Parent or the
Company shall have any further obligation to seek CFIUS Approval; _provided_ ,
that Holdings and Parent have complied with _Section 7.4(d)_ _(g)_ and the
obligation to avoid such a recommendation as specified in this _Section
5.4(d)_. Subject to the foregoing, none of Holdings, Parent or the Company
shall take or permit any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the CFIUS
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements set forth in this _Section
5.4(d)_ constitute the sole obligations of the parties with respect to the
efforts required to obtain CFIUS Approval.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate reasonably with Parent
as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Corporate Actions.

(f) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Zhuhai Seine Technology
Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of PRC (" _Seine_ "), as the
largest shareholder of Apex holding approximately 68.7% of the voting shares
of Apex, has executed and delivered to the Company and Apex an undertaking
letter dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which Seine irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees with the Company, for the benefit of the Company and
Apex, among other things, to attend and to vote in favor of the approval of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) at the Apex Shareholder Meeting and to vote all of the voting shares
held by it in accordance with such undertaking letter.

 

5.5 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Apex,
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall not, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective advisors not to, issue any press release or make any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of SZSE, any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject or (b) with respect to any press release or other public
statement by the Company permitted by _Section 5.3_. The press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint
release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the
Company, Holdings and Parent.

 

5.6 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of one (1)
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and cash bonus
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were provided to
the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) all
other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time, it being 

 



46  understood that following the Effective Time Parent may change the
compensation and benefits covered by this clause (ii) (including eliminating
different forms of compensation and benefits and replacing them with other
forms of compensation and benefits) so long as the compensation and benefits
are no less favorable in the aggregate than were provided to the Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, for the one (1)-year period following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide any
Company Employee who experiences a termination of employment under
circumstances that would have entitled such Company Employee to severance
benefits prior to the Effective Time, the severance benefits described in
_Section 5.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans
of Holdings, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
that coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and Holdings and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

(c) Holdings and Parent hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Benefit Plans will occur at or
prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may pay to
each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries actively employed
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and then participating in any
Benefit Plan that is an annual bonus plan (an " _Annual Bonus Plan_ "), a 

 



47  bonus equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Company
Employees full-year bonus entitlement under all such Annual Bonus Plans for
the Companys 2016 fiscal year, based on the greater of (A) deemed
performance at "target" levels and (B) actual performance as of the Effective
Time, extrapolated through the end of the Companys 2016 fiscal year, and (ii)
a fraction the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed
during the Companys 2016 fiscal year through the Closing Date and the
denominator of which equals 365; _provided_ , that the bonus amount payable to
any employee pursuant to this _Section 5.6(d)_ will be reduced by any
performance bonus previously paid to such individual in respect of a quarterly
performance period during calendar year 2016.

 

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may pay to each
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries actively employed as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and then participating in any Benefit
Plan that is a cash-based long term incentive plan (an " _LTIP_ "), with
respect to each performance period under the LTIP, a bonus equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the Company Employees full bonus
entitlement under the LTIP for the applicable performance period based on the
greater of (A) deemed performance at "target" levels and (B)
actual performance as of the Effective Time, extrapolated through the end of
the applicable performance period, and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which
equals the number of completed months that have elapsed during the applicable
performance period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which
equals the total number of months in the applicable performance period.

(f) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program as set forth in
_Section 5.6(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule to promote retention and
to incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing and to assist in the
transition following the Closing (the " _Retention Program_ ") with any
awards thereunder payable no sooner than quarterly in equal installments on
the three-month, six-month, nine-month and twelve-month anniversaries of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that (i) if a participating employee experiences a
qualifying termination of employment prior to payment of the full award, such
employee shall be entitled to receive the unpaid portion of the award on the
employees date of termination and (ii) the Company may use the Retention
Program to increase the base compensation of one or more individuals and in
such case the amount of the Retention Program shall be decreased by the
annualized amount of such increase. Amounts under the Retention Program shall
be allocated among the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
identified, and in the amounts and on the terms determined, by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (or his designee(s)); _provided_ , that no
such amounts shall be allocated to any Person deemed to be an "officer" of the
Company for purposes of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. If a retention
award or portion thereof under the Retention Program is forfeited by
a participant, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his
designee(s)) may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to
existing employees or new hires of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee any right
to continue in the employ or service of Holdings, Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other 

 



48  modification of any Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Holdings or
Parent; (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former service
provider or employee of Holdings, Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
(or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or (iii) prohibit Holdings,
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any
Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan in accordance with their
applicable terms.

5.7 _Indemnification of_ _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and current directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each
Person who served or is currently serving as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or
for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively,
together with such Persons heirs, executors and administrators, the "
_Covered Persons_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by Law against any costs
and expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any Proceeding or investigation to each Covered
Person to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of indemnifiable acts or
omissions of a Covered Persons service at the request or for the benefit of
the Company occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary in any entity at the request or for the benefit of the
Company). Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Covered Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the process resulting in and the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the Effective Time, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding
or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.7(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures (if any) set forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or
governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. In the event
of any such Proceeding or investigation, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Covered Person in the defense of any
such Proceeding or investigation.

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.7(b)_
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding or

 



49  investigation. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification agreements,
if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is
available for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time (which the Company shall be permitted to
purchase prior to the Effective Time), which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation
or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Persons (including their respective successors and assigns) shall be Third
Party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_. In the event of any breach by the
Surviving Corporation of this _Section 5.7_, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred
by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this _Section 5.7_ as such fees are incurred upon the written request of
such Covered Person. 

5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub, the

 



50  Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company and the Company Board shall take all action reasonably available to it
to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC to the effect
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
"covered person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares,
Company Options or Company RSU Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

5.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
and consult with one another in connection with any stockholder litigation
against any of them or any of their respective directors or officers with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of
and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to prevail in or resolve such litigation so as to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
the manner contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

5.11 _Proxy Statement and Stockholder Meeting_.

7.1_, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC a preliminary proxy statement in connection with convening the Stockholder

its staff or any written request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall promptly provide
Parent with copies of all written correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Company
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, any information relating to Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates,
shareholders, officers or directors, on the one hand, or the Company or any
of its affiliates, officers or directors, on the other hand, is discovered by
Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and such information should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
hereto discovering such information shall promptly notify the other party and,
in each case to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company to the extent
required by and in accordance with applicable Law. Prior to the filing or
mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any

 



51  non-ministerial amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any SEC
comments on the Proxy Statement, unless there has been a Change of Board
Recommendation, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Holdings, Parent
and their affiliates, on the other hand, shall (A) provide each other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all
amendments or supplements to the foregoing documents and (B) consider in good
faith such comments reasonably proposed by the Company, on the one hand, or
Holdings, Parent and their affiliates, on the other hand, as applicable.

 

(b) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section
7.1_, the Company shall take all actions necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Stockholder Meeting in accordance with applicable Laws
and the Company Bylaws and Company Charter in order to consider and vote on a
proposal to adopt this Agreement. The Company shall be permitted to postpone
or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting on one or more occasions (i) with the
consent of Parent, (ii) due to the absence of a quorum, (iii) if the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for
the Stockholder Approval or the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(e) of
the Exchange Act (whether or not a quorum is present), (iv) to the extent
required by applicable Law or upon a request from the SEC or its staff or (v)
to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Stockholder Meeting.

7.1_, subject to _Section 5.3_, (i) the Company Board shall make the Company
Board Recommendation in connection with the Stockholder Meeting, (ii) the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and (iii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit or
cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of
this Agreement. Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information
concerning themselves and their respective affiliates, shareholders, officers
and directors, and provide such other assistance to the Company, as may be
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or
otherwise in connection with the matters set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 

5.12 _Financing_.

(a) Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing, subject to their rights set forth in _Section 5.12(e)_, on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including, as
necessary, the exercise of so-called "flex" provisions) (or, in the case of
the Debt Commitment Letter and the SBLC Commitment Letter, on other available
terms that would not, if structured as an amendment, modification or waiver to
such Commitment Letter, violate _Section 5.12(e)_) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) satisfy on a
timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions to receipt of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and (B) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing consistent with the
terms and conditions contained in

 



52  the applicable Commitment Letters (including the "flex" provisions), as
applicable, or on other available terms that, if structured as an amendment,
modification or waiver to such Commitment Letter, would not violate _Section
5.12(e)_, (ii) comply in all material respects with their obligations under
the Commitment Letters, (iii) in the event that all conditions contained in
the applicable Commitment Letter or the definitive agreement related thereto
have been satisfied, draw or otherwise provide for the receipt of the
Financing on or prior to the Closing to the extent necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) to the extent required to obtain
the Financing, enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters and
definitive agreements related thereto in a timely and diligent manner.

 

(b) In the event any portion of the debt financing contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and such
portion is reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than
those in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. In the event Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall
obtain alternative financing as contemplated by this _Section 5.12(b)_, the
other provisions of this _Section 5.12_ shall apply to such alternative
financing as it applies to the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, _mutatis mutandis_.

(c) In the event any portion of the debt financing contemplated in the SBLC
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the SBLC Commitment Letter and such
portion is reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Holdings Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than those in the SBLC
Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. In the event Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain alternative
financing as contemplated by this _Section 5.12(c)_, the other provisions of
this _Section 5.12_ shall apply to such alternative financing as it applies
to the Financing contemplated by the SBLC Commitment Letter, _mutatis
mutandis_.

 

(d) Parent shall promptly (and in any event, within three (3) Business Days of
becoming aware) notify the Company in writing (i) of any breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
Parent and/or Merger Sub under the Commitment Letters or any
definitive agreements related thereto or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
other party to any Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related thereto,
and (ii) of the receipt by Apex, Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub of any notice
or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related

 



53  thereto (including any proposal by any investor named in any Commitment
Letter to withdraw, terminate or reduce the amount of financing contemplated
by the applicable Commitment Letter) in each case, that could result in
Parent and Merger Sub not receiving any portion of the proceeds of the
Financing on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in no event shall Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub be required to disclose any information that is subject
to attorney-client or similar privilege if Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub
shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in
a way that would not waive such privilege or would (in the opinion of outside
counsel) contravene any applicable Law. In the event that Apex, Holdings,
Parent and/or Merger Sub do not provide access or information in reliance on
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Apex, Holdings, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide notice to the Company that such access or
information is being withheld and Apex, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, Holdings, Parent and
Merger Sub shall not consent to any termination of, amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Commitment Letter if
such termination, amendment, modification or waiver (i) would impose new
or additional conditions precedent or adversely change the conditions
precedent set forth therein, (ii) would reduce the amount of the Financing
contemplated therein, (iii) would adversely impact the ability of Holdings,
Parent and/or Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters
or (iv) would otherwise reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or make the funding of
the commitments thereunder less likely to occur (collectively, the "
_Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, it
is understood that, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
5.12_ and in the Debt Commitment Letter and SBLC Commitment Letter, Parent
and Merger Sub may amend such Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, initial purchasers or similar
entities, but if and only if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, and together with any amendments or
modifications to the applicable Commitment Letters in connection therewith,
would not result in the occurrence of a Restricted Commitment Letter
Amendment). Each of Merger Sub and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of the Commitment Letters until the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated. For purposes of this Agreement, references to
either "Commitment Letter" and to the "Financing", "SBLC Financing", "Debt
Financing" or "Equity Financing" (in each case, other than references to such
terms for purposes of representations made at the date of this Agreement)
shall include such document and such financing contemplated thereby as
permitted or required by this _Section 5.12_ to be amended, modified,
replaced or waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification,
replacement or waiver. Upon the Companys request to Parent, Holdings, Parent
and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
their efforts to arrange the Financing.

 

(f) Apex, Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirm
their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and 
_6.2_.

 



54 5.13 _Financing Assistance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause Company
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to provide, such cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing (or any alternative financing sought or
obtained by Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with the terms hereof) as
may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub, including using their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish Parent, Merger Sub and their
Financing Sources with (A) the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries identified in Paragraph 10 of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment
Letter and the SBLC Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, and (B) to the
extent requested by Parent, all other information and data related to the
Company and its Subsidiaries necessary for Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to satisfy the conditions set forth in Paragraph 11 of Exhibit C
of the Debt Commitment Letter and the SBLC Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof (subject to the immediately following proviso, the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B) together, the " _Required Financial Information_ ") and (C) such
other financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent that is customarily
needed for financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have no
obligation to prepare or to provide any adjustments, assumptions, estimates,
projections or other information in connection with the preparation of the pro
forma financial statements requested by the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii)
participate and direct senior management and representatives of the Company
to participate, in each case at mutually agreeable times and places and with

57  conditions, including pricing terms and amendments to the terms and
provisions of the applicable Indenture, that are specified, from time to time,
by Parent (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ ")

Offer (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of
time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company
and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents. In
addition, Parent shall not commence any Debt Offer until the date that is
twenty (20) days prior to the first date on which the Company and Parent

Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective officers, directors, employee, attorneys, accountants and
other Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all
reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any
Debt Offer (including, to the extent required by the policies or procedures of
the Depository Trust Company in connection with any consent solicitation that
is part of any Debt Offer, the Company conducting any such
consent solicitation pursuant to materials provided by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company); _provided_ , that neither the Company nor
counsel for the Company shall be required to furnish (i) any legal opinions
other than, following a consent solicitation, to the applicable trustee
pursuant to Section 9.04 of the 2018 Indenture or Section 9.04 of the 2020
Indenture or any negative assurance letters in connection with the Debt Offers
or (ii) any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for use in any Debt Offer Document or otherwise in connection with
any Debt Offer (and no such information shall be so used without the Companys
prior written consent). The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information
agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers
will be selected by Parent after consultation with the Company and their fees
and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the condition set forth
in _Section 6.2(b)_, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 5.14(a)_, shall be deemed satisfied. 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, at
Parents expense: (i) take all actions and prepare and deliver all other
documents (including any officers certificates and legal opinions) as may be
reasonably required under the applicable Indenture to consummate a redemption
of each series of Notes, including (A) to issue a notice of redemption of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Notes
(together with all accrued and unpaid interest and applicable premiums or
consent payments related to such series of Notes) pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the applicable Indentures; _provided_ , that such notice shall
not be required to be issued by the Company prior 

 



58  to the Effective Time, (B) to take such actions as are necessary to cause
the satisfaction and discharge of the applicable Indentures and such series of
Notes substantially concurrently with the Closing (subject to the irrevocable
deposit by Parent with the applicable trustee on the Closing Date of funds
sufficient to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of,
accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date on, and applicable
premiums or consent payments related to, such series of Notes, as arranged by
Parent) and (C) to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable
trustee to agree to proceed with a redemption and/or satisfaction
and discharge as set forth above; and (ii) provide Parent the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on each of the notices and other documents
contemplated by this _Section 5.14(b)_ reasonably in advance of their
delivery.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.14_, (i) the
Company will not be required to pay, purchase or otherwise retire any
indebtedness pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ prior to the Effective Time, and
then only subject to provision of adequate funds by Parent, (ii) in no event
shall the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any
supplemental indenture or other agreement that would become effective prior to
the Effective Time and (iii) nothing herein shall be deemed an admission that
Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required by the terms of the
Indentures to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined in the applicable
Indenture). Each Debt Offer and/or redemption pursuant to this _Section
5.14_, if any, shall be conducted in compliance with applicable Law,
including SEC rules and regulations, to the extent applicable, and such
compliance shall not be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.14_ or any other
provision of this Agreement. 

(d) Parent shall make available to the Company on or prior to the Effective
Time all funds necessary to satisfy any obligations of the Company to holders
of the Notes that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 5.14_, including (i) any funds necessary to complete the
discharge of any Notes and (ii) principal, interest or any applicable
premiums, in connection with any Debt Offer that is commenced or settled on or
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this _Section 5.14_. Parent
shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent such costs,
fees and expenses are incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or its
or their respective Representatives in connection with them complying with
their obligations under this _Section 5.14_, and Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and its or their
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by them to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs or expenses arose out of the actions taken by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ (other than historical information provided
in writing by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or its or
their Representatives specifically for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.14_), except in the event such
losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or
expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or
any of its or their respective Representatives.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall
require the Companys cooperation to the extent it would (i) require the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to take
any action that would reasonably be expected, in the judgment of the Company,
after consultation with its legal counsel, to conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any applicable Laws, (iii) cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached or become inaccurate, cause any
condition to the Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach
of this Agreement, (iv) cause the discharge of any Notes in the event
the Merger is not consummated or (v) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and Company Subsidiaries.

 



59 5.15 _Letters of Credit_.

(the " _LC Expiration Date_ "). Parent covenants and agrees that, except as
expressly set forth in the Letter of Credit, there shall be no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Issuing Bank to provide funds under the

expected to reduce the total amount available to be drawn under the Letter of
Credit.

 

(b) The Letter of Credit, when delivered pursuant to _Section 5.15(a)_, shall
be a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuing Bank, and in full
force and effect, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other
similar Laws of general applicability affecting creditors rights and to
general equitable principles, including specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief. On or prior to the date of issuance of
the Letter of Credit, Parent shall pay in full any and all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Credit
or any financing facility or reimbursement agreement under which the Letter of
Credit is issued required to be paid by such date and, thereafter, shall
timely pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
failure by Parent to comply with the provisions of _Section 5.15(a)_ or
_Section 5.15(b)_ shall be deemed to constitute a material and willful breach
by Parent of this _Section 5.15_; _provided_ that, if Parent shall not
have delivered the Letter of Credit by the LC Delivery Deadline in compliance
herewith, Parent shall be permitted to cure such breach by delivering to the
Company, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 13, 2016 (the "
_LC Cure Deadline_ "), an original, executed letter of credit (for the
avoidance of doubt, not a copy or facsimile or other image thereof) in a form
in all material respects consistent with, or more favorable to the Company
than the terms set forth in, the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(including with respect to face amount, expiration date, draw conditionality
and time period between presentation of a demand for payment and

 



60  payment) issued by a Qualified Bank (other than a U.S. Branch of the Bank of
China Limited) that complies (other than as to the identity of the issuing
bank) as of the date of such delivery with  _Section 5.15(a)_ and _Section
5.15(b)_. In the case of such a cure by Parent, from and after delivery of
such letter of credit, all references in this Agreement to the "Letter of
Credit" shall be deemed to be references to such letter of credit so
delivered and references to the "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to be
references to the Qualified Bank that issued such Letter of Credit.

 

(d) In the event that, at least thirty-five (35) days prior to the LC
Expiration Date, the Company has commenced a suit, action, arbitration or
other Proceeding against Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub, Apex or any of their
respective Representatives or affiliates seeking to enforce the Companys
rights under this Agreement, the Letter of Credit or any Replacement Letter
of Credit, Parent shall cause to be delivered, no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the LC Expiration Date, a replacement irrevocable standby letter of
credit from a Qualified Bank in favor of the Company, and in substantially the
same form as the Letter of Credit (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
same conditions to drawing as the Letter of Credit), in a face amount equal to
the lesser of $150,000,000 and the aggregate amount of then outstanding claims
(the " _Replacement Letter of Credit_ ").

(e) Parent shall cause to be delivered subsequent Replacement Letters of
Credit so that the Company at all times holds a Letter of Credit or
Replacement Letter of Credit satisfying the requirements of _Section 5.15(d)_
until twenty (20) Business Days following the final and non-appealable
determination with respect to all such suits, actions, arbitrations or other
Proceedings against Apex, Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub.

(f) Parent will cause to be paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of any Replacement Letter of
Credit or any financing facility or reimbursement agreement under which any
Replacement Letter of Credit is issued (a " _Replacement LC Credit Facility_
").

(g) Failure to deliver a Replacement Letter of Credit in accordance with the
terms of this  _Section 5.15_ shall entitle the Company to immediately draw
the full amount of the then outstanding claims from the Letter of Credit or
Replacement Letter of Credit, as applicable; _provided_ , that if it is later
determined that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not the prevailing
party with respect to the claims in any suit, action, arbitration or other
Proceeding for which the amounts were drawn from the Letter of Credit or
Replacement Letter of Credit, or that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is not entitled to the amounts drawn from the Letter of Credit or Replacement
Letter of Credit, then the Company shall promptly cause the return to Parent
of all such amounts drawn under the Letter of Credit or Replacement Letter of
Credit to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary was not so entitled.

(a) Apex shall promptly following the date hereof (i) call and convene the
Apex Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Apex Shareholder
Approval

 



61  and (ii) obtain the Apex Shareholder Approval ( _provided_ , that if Apex
fails to obtain such approval at the first Apex Shareholder Meeting called
after the date hereof, such failure shall be deemed to constitute a material
and willful breach by Apex of this _Section 5.16_).

(b) Apex shall promptly following the date hereof make or cause to be made
such filings or disclosures as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within the period of time required by applicable Law), and shall take all
other actions, as may be required to obtain the SZSE Clearance as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

(c) Apex hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to take
any actions (including issuing any common shares or other securities of Apex
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or other
securities of Apex) from and after the date hereof until the Apex Shareholder
Approval is obtained, with the effect or intent of diluting the share
ownership held by Seine in Apex, and Seine irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees not to vote in favor of and to vote against and otherwise prevent the
foregoing.

any condition to Closing set forth in _Article 6_;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction in any case in a
Material Jurisdiction, (i) shall have issued an Order, or taken any other
action, in each case, permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, and, in each case, such Order or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable (which the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.1(c)(i)_
shall have used all required efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 5.4_) or (ii) shall have failed to
issue an Order, or to take any other action that is necessary to fulfill the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(e)_, and such
denial of a request to issue such Order or the failure to take such other
action shall have become final and nonappealable (which Order or other action
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ shall have used all required efforts to obtain, in accordance with
_Section 5.4_); _provided_ , that Parent shall not have any right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ based on any Order
or other action in respect of or relating to (other than in an ancillary and
immaterial way) the Apex Shareholder Meeting or the Apex
Shareholder Approval;

(d) by Parent, if Parent has requested withdrawal of the notice filed with
CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with _Section 5.4(d)_ or by the Company following a CFIUS
Turndown; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(d)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose failure to
comply with _Section 5.4_ has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such
action or inaction;

(e) by either the Company or Parent, if the Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Stockholder Meeting duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this

Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any written notice of the
Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation prior to
effecting such Change of Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section
5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_ shall not result in Parent having any
termination rights pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_) or (ii) the Company
shall have entered into a definitive merger agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that Parents
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)(i)_ shall
expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh (7th) calendar day
following the date on which the event first permitting such
termination occurred;

(g) by the Company in order to effect a Change of Board Recommendation or
enter into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal
either concurrently or immediately following such termination, but only if the
Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under _Section 5.3_ with respect to 

 



65  such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall prior to or
concurrently with such termination pay, or cause to be paid, the Company
Termination Fee to or for the account of Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3_;

that any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ is not reasonably capable of being satisfied while such breach is
continuing, (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company written notice of
such breach and (iii) either such breach is not capable of cure prior to the
Outside Date or at least forty-five (45) calendar days have elapsed since the
date of delivery of such written notice to the Company and such breach shall
not have been cured such that the relevant conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ would be reasonably capable of being
satisfied;  _provided_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(h)_ if there has been any material
breach by Apex, Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub of its material
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, and
such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects;

(i) by the Company, if: there has been (i) a material breach by Apex of
_Section 5.16_ of this Agreement or a breach by Holdings, Parent or Merger
Sub by reason of its or their failure to deliver the aggregate Merger
Consideration to the Paying Agent and/or consummate the Merger as and when
required hereunder or (ii) (A) a breach by Holdings, Parent, Apex or Merger
Sub of any of its or their representations, warranties or covenants contained

such breach is continuing, (B) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
written notice of such breach and (C) either such breach is not capable of
cure prior to the Outside Date or at least forty-five (45) calendar days shall
have elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to Parent and
such breach shall not have been cured such that the relevant conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ would be reasonably
capable of being satisfied; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(i)_ if
there has been any material breach by the Company of its material
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
and such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects; or

(j) by the Company, at any time after the LC Cure Deadline, if there has been
a breach by Parent of _Section 5.15(a)_ or _Section 5.15(b)_ that has not
been cured pursuant to and in accordance with the proviso to _Section
5.15(c)_.

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in  _Section 7.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall become
void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates,
officers or directors; _provided_ , that (i) no such termination shall relieve
the Company of its obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee, if, as and
when required pursuant to _Section 7.3_ (which _Section 7.3_ shall survive
any such termination); (ii) no such termination shall relieve Parent of
its obligation to pay the Parent

 



66  Termination Fee or the Other Regulatory Termination Fee, if, as and when
required pursuant to _Section 7.4_ (which _Section 7.4_ shall survive any
such termination) or Apex of its obligation in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 8.18_; (iii) no such termination shall relieve the Company,
Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub or Apex from liability for any willful and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination; and (iv) the
Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 5.2(b)_, the penultimate paragraph of
_Section 5.4(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,  _Section 5.13(c)_,
this _Section 7.2_ and _Article 8_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

7.3  _Company Termination Fee_.

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, then
the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent,
prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case of a termination
by the Company, or within three (3) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a
termination by Parent, a termination fee equal to $95,000,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ ").

(b) The parties agree that if (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent
pursuant to  _Section 7.1(h)_ due to a material breach by the Company of its
obligations set forth in _Section 5.3_, _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.13_ or
_Section 5.14_ or (B) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_
and (ii) (x) after the date hereof and prior to the Stockholder Meeting (in
the case of any such termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_) or the date of
termination of this Agreement (in the case of any such termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(h)_), an Acquisition Proposal (other than any offer or
proposal made in connection with or arising out of the Corporate Actions) is
made to the Company or the Company Board or is made public by the Company or
any other Person, and is not withdrawn and (y) within twelve (12) months after
such termination, the Company either (1) enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is
ultimately consummated (whether or not during such twelve (12) month period),
or (2) consummates such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay (or
cause to be paid), within three (3) Business Days after the consummation of
such transaction, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent, the Company Termination Fee. For
purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.5_, except that the
references to "25%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in this _Section
7.3_ is an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this _Section
7.3_, Merger Sub and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub all reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable attorneys fees as
well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated
by Merger Sub), together with interest on the amount of the
Company Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be made.

 



67 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion. Payment of the
Company Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute liquidated
damages as a reasonable amount that will compensate Holdings, Parent, Merger
Sub and Apex in the circumstances upon which the Company Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunity foregone with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby which
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and, except as
provided in clauses _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ of the proviso of _Section 7.2_,
from and after such termination as described in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b)_
, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further
liability or obligations of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under _Sections 7.3(a)_
and _7.3(b)_.

 

(e) Except in the case of fraud and subject to Parents and Merger Subs
rights set forth in _Section 8.16_, Parents right to receive payment from
the Company of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or affiliates
(collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount (if entitled under
this _Section 7.3_), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger
(except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to this _Section
7.3_, to the extent applicable, and except that the Company shall remain
obligated for, and Parent and its affiliates may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the provisions and agreements surviving such termination pursuant
to _Section 7.2_). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub
may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section
8.16_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this _Section
7.3_, under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Company
Termination Fee (if entitled under this _Section 7.3_). In any circumstance
where performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement
would relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Company Termination
Fee, Parent and Merger Sub may, in their sole discretion (i) seek specific
performance pursuant to _Section 8.16_, (ii) withdraw any claim for specific
performance and require payment of the Company Termination Fee if entitled to
payment of the Company Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_ or (iii) if
Merger Sub and Parent are unable for any reason to obtain
specific performance, require payment of the Company Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_.

 

7.4 _Parent Termination Fee and Other Regulatory Termination Fee_.

 

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ (other than as provided for in _Section
7.4(b)_ and _Section 7.4(d)_) or _Section 7.1(j)_, then Parent shall, within
three (3) Business Day following any such termination, pay (or cause to be
paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company a termination fee equal to $150,000,000
(the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

 



68 (b) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A) _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ due to an
Order of or action by any Governmental Entity in the PRC, without regard to
any subsequent Order of or action (or failure to issue an Order or to take
action) by any Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction or (B) _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ due to failure to issue an Order or to take action by any
Governmental Entity in the PRC, without regard to any subsequent Order of or
action (or failure to issue an Order or to take action) by any Governmental
Entity in any jurisdiction; or

 

(ii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or (B) by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ due to a breach by Holdings, Parent or
Merger Sub of _Section 5.4(a)_ or _Section 5.4(b)_ and, in each case, (1)
any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ (as a result of an Order
of a Governmental Entity or statute, rule or regulation in the PRC) or
_Section 6.1(e)_ have not been satisfied at the time of such termination and
there is no final and nonappealable Order of a Governmental Entity in respect
of Competition Law in any Material Jurisdiction other than the PRC, Austria,
Germany, Poland or Russia that became final and nonappealable prior to such
Order of a Governmental Entity or statute, rule or regulation in the PRC, and
(2) the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than any conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing Date (so long as such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied)),

 

then Parent shall, within three (3) Business Day following any such
termination, pay (or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company the Parent
Termination Fee.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay
the Parent Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion. Payment of the
Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute liquidated
damages as a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances upon which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunity foregone with respect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby which would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision and, except as provided in clauses
_(iii)_ and _(iv)_ of the proviso of _Section 7.2_, from and after such
termination as described in _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _7.4(b)_ , none of Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub shall have any further liability or obligations of any
kind in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby
other than as provided under this _Section 7.4_.

 

(d) The parties agree that:

 

(i) (A) if this Agreement is terminated (1) by the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_, (2) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ due to
a breach by Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub of _Section 5.4(d)_ and there is
no final and nonappealable Order of a Governmental Entity in respect of
Competition Law in any Material Jurisdiction, 

 



69  other than the PRC (which is covered by _Section 7.4(b)_), Austria,
Germany, Poland or Russia, that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the Merger and that became final and nonappealable prior to
such breach or (3) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ and
the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_ has not been satisfied at the
time this Agreement is terminated, and (B)(1) the representations and
warranties of the Company in _Section 3.26_ were true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of such
termination as though made on and as of the date of such termination or (2)
the representations and warranties of the Company in _Section 3.26_ were not
true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the date of such termination as though made on and as of the date of
such termination and the underlying fact or circumstance causing the failure
of the representations and warranties of the Company in _Section 3.26_ to be
true and correct in all material respects was not the primary cause of the
failure to obtain CFIUS Approval prior to the termination of this Agreement;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A)
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ due to an Order of or action by any Governmental Entity
in respect of Competition Law in Austria, Germany, Poland or Russia, without
regard to any subsequent Order of or action (or failure to issue an Order or
to take action) by any Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction, or (B)
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ due to failure to issue an Order or to take action by
any Governmental Entity in respect of Competition Law in Austria, Germany,
Poland or Russia, without regard to any subsequent Order of or action (or
failure to issue an Order or to take action) by any Governmental Entity in any
jurisdiction, and in each case, there is no final and nonappealable Order of
a Governmental Entity in respect of Competition Law in any Material
Jurisdiction other than the PRC (which is covered by _Section 7.4(b))_,
Austria, Germany, Poland or Russia that restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger and that became final and
nonappealable prior to (A) or (B) as aforementioned; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ due to
a breach by Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub of _Section 5.4(a)_ or _Section
5.4(b)_ and, in each case, (1) any of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1(a)_ (as a result of an Order of a Governmental Entity or statute, rule or
regulation in respect of Competition Law in Austria, Germany, Poland or
Russia) or _Section 6.1(b)_ (in respect of Competition Law in Austria,
Germany, Poland or Russia) have not been satisfied at the time of such
termination and (2) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than any conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing Date (so long as such conditions are then capable of
being satisfied)),

then Parent shall, within three (3) Business Days following any such
termination, pay (or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company a
termination fee equal to $95,000,000 (the " _Other Regulatory Termination Fee_
")

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay
the Other Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of
the Other Regulatory Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute
liquidated damages as a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances upon which the

 



70  Other Regulatory Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunity foregone with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby which would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision and, except as provided in clauses _(iii)_ and
_(iv)_ of the proviso in _Section 7.2_, from and after such termination as
described in _Section 7.4(d)_, none of Holdings, Parent or Merger Sub shall
have any further liability or obligations of any kind in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 7.4_.

 

(f) Parent acknowledges that the agreement contained in this _Section 7.4_ is
an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this _Section 7.4_, the
Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent
fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.4_, Parent
shall pay to the Company all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
enforcement (including reasonable attorneys fees as well as reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated by the Company),
together with interest on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee or the
Other Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is
required to be made.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be required to pay
pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ more than the Parent Termination Fee.

(h) Except in the case of fraud and subject to the Companys rights set forth
in _Sections 8.11_,  _8.16_ and _8.18_ , the Companys right to receive
payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee or the Other Regulatory
Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company Related Parties against Holdings, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or Financing Sources
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount (if entitled under
_Section 7.4_) but subject to _Section 7.2_, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger (except that Parent shall also be obligated
with respect to this _Section 7.4_, to the extent applicable, and except that
Parent and Apex shall remain obligated for, and the Company and its affiliates
may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the provisions and agreements
surviving such termination pursuant to _Section 7.2_).

7.5  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by each of the Company, Apex,
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub only by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto; _provided_ , that no amendment, supplement or change may be
made to _Section 7.4(h)_, _Section 8.11_ , _Section 8.13_,  _Section
8.17_ or this _Section 7.5_ that adversely impacts any Financing Source or
any affiliate or representative thereof without the prior written consent of
the Financing Source or Financing Sources, as applicable, adversely impacted.

7.6 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Holdings, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the
other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c)
waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term

renewals thereof, _provided_ , that no assignment to any such lender will in
any way affect Holdings, Parents, Merger Subs or Apexs obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.

8.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or

than (a) any Persons entitled to indemnification or insurance benefits under
the provisions of _Section 5.6(a)_, with respect to such provisions, (b) the

receive payments contemplated hereby in respect thereof after the Effective
Time, and (d) _Section 7.4(h)_ , this  _Section 8.11_, _Section 8.13_,

providing alternative debt financing pursuant to the terms hereof. In
addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to pursue damages on behalf

out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Companys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
the total amount payable to such stockholders under this Agreement and the
time value of money), in the event of Holdings, Parent or Merger Subs willful
and material breach of this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged
by Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently,
may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances.

 

8.12 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"

limitation, but rather shall

 



86  be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes"
and "Schedules" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and
Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. The schedules and annexes attached to
this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein
for all purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein,"

8.13 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Arbitration_.

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws principles that
would result in the application of any Law other than the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that in order to obtain prompt and
expeditious resolution of all disputes arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including the existence, validity, interpretation or performance of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any claim arising out of or related to the
parties relationship, rights, duties and obligations hereunder, whether
based on contract, tort or statute, and the substantive or procedural
arbitrability of any claim hereunder), all such disputes shall be exclusively
resolved by final and binding arbitration under the Delaware Rapid
Arbitration Act (the " _DRAA_ ", 10 _Del. C_. § 5801 _et seq_.) and the
Delaware Rapid Arbitration Rules promulgated thereunder by the Supreme Court
of the State of Delaware (" _Rules_ ") in effect at the time of the date of
delivery of the notice of arbitration, except as modified herein.

(i) The arbitral panel shall consist of three arbitrators (the " _Tribunal_
"). The situs of the arbitration shall be the State of Delaware, although the
evidentiary and other proceedings shall be conducted in New York (Manhattan),
New York. The Tribunal may conduct proceedings in other locations if
necessary for the taking of evidence. The language of the arbitration
proceedings, and of the arbitral award, shall be the English language. The
parties hereto agree that (A) the claimant(s) and respondent(s) shall each
appoint one arbitrator within twenty (20) days of the date of delivery of the
notice of arbitration; and (B) the two party-appointed arbitrators shall
appoint the third arbitrator, who shall serve as the chair of the Tribunal,
within twenty (20) days from the date of the appointment of the second
arbitrator. Each member of the Tribunal must be a former judge of the Delaware
Supreme Court and/or Delaware Court of Chancery;  _provided_ , that in the
event a former Delaware judge is unavailable to serve as arbitrator for one or
more of the positions on the Tribunal, then the parties hereto shall submit a
petition for the appointment of one or more arbitrators (as needed to
complete the three-member Tribunal) to the Court of

 



87  Chancery of the State of Delaware under Section 5805 of the DRAA. Any
arbitrator not timely appointed as provided in clause _(A)_ or _(B)_ of
this  _Section 8.13(b)(i)_ shall be appointed by the Delaware Court of
Chancery in accordance with Section 5805 of the DRAA. In the event that the
Tribunal retains counsel in consultation with the parties hereto under Section
5806 of the DRAA, then such counsel shall be impartial and shall be
knowledgeable about and experienced with the practice of law and have had at
least fifteen (15) years of legal experience in the area of mergers and
acquisitions or complex commercial transactions. Only the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware shall have the power and authority to appoint a new
arbitrator in the event any arbitrator becomes unable to continue as
arbitrator for any reason.

 

(ii) The arbitration shall be deemed commenced when the claimant(s) deliver a
notice of arbitration to all of the respondents in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 8.4_. The parties hereto agree that the preliminary
conference shall be no later than ten (10) days after the constitution of the
Tribunal. The parties hereto agree that any service or written communication
(including, the answer, any reply or exchange of information) under the DRAA
or the Rules shall be made in a manner provided by _Section 8.4_ of this
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the parties. In connection with
any arbitration proceeding hereunder, the Tribunal shall allow reasonable
requests for the production of documents relevant to the dispute and permit
the taking of depositions limited to not more than five (5) persons on each
side and for not more than six (6) hours in total for the deposition of each
such person. Where reasonably necessary, depositions may be taken by
videoconference or other telephonic means, or in the jurisdiction where a
witness resides or regularly transacts business. The Tribunal may seek to
compel the production of evidence from non-parties to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. The arbitration hearing shall be limited to one
(1) day, if the Tribunal deems such limitation appropriate, and _provided_ ,
that the Tribunal, where it considers it appropriate in order to provide any
party with a full and fair opportunity to be heard, may require a hearing be
held over the course of more than one day, and shall be conducted as soon as
reasonably practicable after the constitution of the Tribunal, as determined
by the Tribunal.

(iii) For the purposes of DRAA § 5808(b), and all other purposes, the
Tribunal shall issue its final award as promptly as practicable taking into
account the nature of the claims and any other facts or circumstances the
Tribunal deems relevant, but in no event later than ninety (90) calendar days
after the close of the arbitration hearing. The parties agree that the
Tribunal may extend any deadline set forth in _Section 8.13(b)(ii)_ and
_(iii)_ if, in its own discretion, more time is needed in light of the
nature of the claims and the relevant facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is
authorized to award monetary damages and to grant specific performance of this
Agreement and other injunctive relief, including interim relief pending
the final award. The parties hereto shall bear their own costs incurred in
connection with the arbitration and share equally the fees and expenses of the
Tribunal and the costs of administration.

 

(iv) Nothing in this _Section 8.13(b)_ shall prevent a party from seeking
provisional, interim or conservatory measures from any court of competent
jurisdiction at any time if any such party believes in good faith that it will
suffer irreparable injury before the Tribunal has been appointed or before the
Tribunal has had time to render a final award. Any such request by a party to
a court for provisional, interim or conservatory measures shall not be deemed
incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate in this _Section 8.13(b)_, the
DRAA or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

 



88 (v) The arbitral award shall be final and non-appealable. Judgment upon the
arbitral award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby agree to waive any claim that this
agreement to arbitrate is not valid under the Laws of the U.S., any foreign
country or any international agreement.

 

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt, and in furtherance of _Section 8.13(a)_ of
this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that any
legal proceeding conducted under this _Section 8.13(b)_ shall be governed by
or construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws and regardless of whether the laws of the
State of Delaware govern the parties other rights, remedies, liabilities,
powers and duties.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.13_ to the contrary, each of
the parties agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding against the Debt
Financing Sources or the SBLC Financing Sources in connection with the Debt
Financing, the SBLC Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the SBLC
Commitment Letter or this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of
Manhattan or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof), County of New York, Borough of
Manhattan. In any such action, each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such
courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be
heard and determined in such courts; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in such courts; (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in such courts; (v)
consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction
of the courts referred to in this  _Section 8.13(c)_ in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 8.4_, or in any other manner permitted by Law; and
(vi) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation against the Debt Financing Sources
or the SBLC Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, the SBLC
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the SBLC Commitment Letter or this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.14 _Sovereign Immunity_. With respect to the liability and obligations of
Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub and Apex, with respect to themselves, their
affiliates or their property, each of Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub and Apex:

(a) agrees that, for the purposes of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the
execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement constitutes
private and commercial acts done for private and commercial purposes;

 



89 (b) agrees that, should any Proceedings be brought against any or all of them,
any of its affiliates or any of its assets in any jurisdiction in relation to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, Holdings,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be entitled to any immunity on the basis of
sovereignty in respect of its obligations under this Agreement, and no
immunity from such Proceedings (including, without limitation, immunity from
service of process from suit, from the jurisdiction of any court, from an
order or injunction of such court or the enforcement of same against its
assets) shall be claimed by or on behalf of such party or with respect to its
assets;

(c) waives, in any such Proceedings, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any right of immunity which it, any of its affiliates or any of its assets now
has or may acquire in the future in any jurisdiction;

 

(d) consents generally in respect of the enforcement of any judgment or award
against it or any of its affiliates in any such Proceedings to the giving of
any relief or the issue of any process in any jurisdiction in connection with
such Proceedings (including, without limitation, pre-judgment attachment, post
judgment attachment, the making, enforcement or execution against or
in respect of any assets whatsoever irrespective of their use or intended use
of any order or judgment that may be made or given in connection therewith);
and

 

(e) specifies that, for the purposes of this provision, "assets" shall be
taken as excluding "premises of the mission" as defined in the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations signed at Vienna, April 18, 1961, "consular
premises" as defined in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations signed in
1963, and military property or military assets or property of Holdings,
Parent or Merger Sub or of any country.

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each
of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when the Company, on the one hand, and Holdings, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto. Until and unless the Company, on the one hand, and
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have
no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether
by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to
bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

8.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in

 



90  connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive
relief and (c) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance,
and agree not to assert in any Proceeding, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at Law. In circumstances where Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub are
obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated,
Holdings, Parent, Merger Sub and Apex expressly acknowledge and agree that
the Company and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that
monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the Company and its
stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to
enforce specifically Holdings Parents, Merger Subs and Apexs obligations
with respect to the consummation of the Merger. The Companys pursuit of
specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company
may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by the Company and its stockholders.

8.17 _No Recourse or Liability Against Debt Financing Sources or SBLC
Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company agrees and acknowledges, both
for itself and its affiliates, that no recourse under this Agreement or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be
had by the Company or its affiliates against any Debt Financing Source or SBLC
Financing Source (in their capacities as such) whether by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on
or otherwise be incurred by any Debt Financing Source or SBLC Financing
Source (in their capacities as such) for any obligation of Holdings, Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation.

8.18 _Guarantee_. To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Apex
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and
not as a surety, to the Company the full and timely payment and performance by
Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub of all of their respective covenants,
obligations, undertakings and liabilities under, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate obligations of Apex under
this _Section 8.18_ exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
hereunder, other than with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable
under _Section 5.7_, _5.13(c)_ or in connection with any Corporate Actions.
In addition, Apex shall provide to Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub all
assistance necessary to enable Holdings, Parent and Merger Sub to comply with
all its or their obligations hereunder, including _Article 5_ , to
the fullest extent contemplated hereby. Apex acknowledges that it is
receiving benefits in connection with providing this guaranty pursuant to this
_Section 8.18_. The guaranty pursuant to this _Section 8.18_ shall terminate
as of immediately after the Effective Time, other than with respect to any
and all amounts that may be payable under _Section 5.7_.
