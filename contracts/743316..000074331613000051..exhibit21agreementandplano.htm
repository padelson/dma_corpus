AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
August 15, 2013, by and among: Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Victory Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"), and Volterra
Semiconductor Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

A. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by Parent,
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Acquisition Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended
from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, at a per
share price of $23.00 in cash (such amount, or any greater amount per share
paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the "Offer Price"), without
interest thereon and subject to any required Tax withholding.

C. Following the Acceptance Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall merge with and
into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement (the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company being
referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger") and each share of Company
Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer shall
upon the Merger be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price.

D. Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall be
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL") if the conditions of Section 251(h) can be
satisfied and shall be consummated as soon as practicable following the
completion of the Offer.

E. The Company\'s board of directors has unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, taken together, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, and (ii) adopted resolutions approving this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, declaring their advisability and recommending that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Company Common
Stock to Acquisition Sub in the Offer, and, to the extent applicable, approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger.

F. The board of directors of Acquisition Sub has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions, taken together, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests
of Acquisition Sub and its sole stockholder, and (ii) adopted resolutions
approving this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, declaring their advisability and recommending the
adoption by its sole stockholder of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other Contemplated Transactions (and following execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub shall adopt this
Agreement).

G. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Acquisition Sub\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, each of the executive officers and directors of the
Company is entering into the Tender and Support Agreement substantially in the
form attached as Exhibit C (the "Tender and Support Agreement").



AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

Section 1. THE OFFER



1.1 Conduct of the Offer.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than the
10th business day after the date of this Agreement (unless another



date shall be agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company); provided,
however, that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer, and
the 10 business day period (or such other period as shall be agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company) referred to in this sentence shall be
accordingly extended, if the Company shall not: (i) have: (A) provided to
Parent on a timely basis all information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the preparation of the Offer Documents; or (B) reviewed and
provided comments to Parent on the Offer Documents on a timely basis; (ii)
have given: (A) Parent and its legal counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC; or
(B) due consideration to any such reasonable comments provided by Parent or
its legal counsel; and (iii) be prepared to file with the SEC immediately
following commencement of the Offer, and to disseminate to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9. The date on which Acquisition Sub
commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act,
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Commencement Date."



(b) The obligation of Acquisition Sub (and the obligation of Parent to cause
Acquisition Sub) to accept for payment, and pay for, shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction or (if permitted) waiver of (and shall not be
subject to any other conditions): (i) the condition (the "Minimum Condition")
that prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer, there shall be validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) a number of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee) that, together with any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or another subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, represents a majority of the
Adjusted Outstanding Share Number; and (ii) the other conditions set forth in
Exhibit B (the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Exhibit
B are referred to collectively as the "Offer Conditions"). For purposes of
this Agreement, the "Adjusted Outstanding Share Number" shall be the sum of:
(A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time; plus (B) an additional
number of shares equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise, as applicable, of
all options, warrants and other rights to acquire, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (other than the Top-Up Option, if
applicable, and Company Options that vest after the Outside Date).

(c) Parent and Acquisition Sub each expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion to: (i) increase the Offer Price; and (ii) waive any Offer
Condition or make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer;
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall: (A) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Condition; or (B) make any change to the Offer that: (1) changes the
form of consideration to be delivered by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the
Offer; (2) decreases the Offer Price; (3) changes the Offer so it does not
constitute an offer for any and all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock; (4) amends or modifies any condition set forth in
Exhibit B in any manner adverse (other than in an immaterial respect) to the
holders of Company Common Stock; (5) imposes any conditions to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions; (6) except as provided in Section 1.1(d),
extends or otherwise changes the expiration date of the Offer; or (7)
otherwise amends the Offer in any manner adverse (other than in an immaterial
respect) to the holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, as soon as
practicable after the Expiration Date, Acquisition Sub shall: (x) consummate
the Offer in accordance with its terms; (y) accept for payment all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer (provided, however, that with regard to shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Acquisition Sub
shall be under no obligation to make any payment for such shares unless and
until such shares are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee); and (z) pay the Offer Price in exchange for each share of Company
Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer
promptly as required by Rules 14d-11(e) and 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or any subsequent
offering period contemplated by Section 1.1(d) hereof shall be paid to the
holder thereof in cash or immediately available funds, without interest and
subject to any applicable withholding Taxes. To the extent any such amounts
are withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.



(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on the date that is 21 business days following the Offer
Commencement Date (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule
14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) (the "Initial Expiration Date," such date or
such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the parties\' respective termination rights under Section 8.1: (i)
if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
and has not been waived, Acquisition Sub may, in its discretion (and without
the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or
more occasions, for an additional period of up to 10 business days per
extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Acquisition
Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time for the minimum period required
by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff
thereof or the Nasdaq Stock Market



applicable to the Offer; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date,
any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request
of the Company, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer on one or more
occasions for an additional period of up to 10 business days per extension, to
permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, however, that in no
event shall Acquisition Sub: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date; or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date
without the prior written consent of the Company. If there has been a 251(h)
Inapplicable Determination and the Parent determines not to exercise the Top-
Up Option because the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in Section 1.4 would violate applicable Legal
Requirements, then Acquisition Sub may, and if requested by the Company, shall
make available one or more "subsequent offering periods", in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, of not less than three business days each and
not more than 20 business days in the aggregate for all subsequent offering
periods. Acquisition Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.



(e) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the "Schedule TO"), which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal containing the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including Exhibit B) and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO
and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, being referred to as the
"Offer Documents Offer Documents"); and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent
required by the United States securities Legal Requirements. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Offer
Documents and the filing and dissemination thereof to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as applicable, and with all other applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents (including all
amendments and supplements thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give due consideration to any such
reasonable comments. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the
Company and its legal counsel upon the receipt of any comments received by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or their legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company and
its legal counsel with copies of all written correspondence between them and
their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, or, if
not in writing, a description of such communication. Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall give the Company and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in preparing the proposed response of Parent and Acquisition Sub
to comments received from the SEC or its staff and to provide comments on any
proposed response thereto, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give due
consideration to any such reasonable comments. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company: (1) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents or the Offer; and (2) to the extent required by the applicable
requirements of United States securities Legal Requirements, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents to the extent such information shall be
or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by the United States securities Legal
Requirements, to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all
information concerning the Acquired Corporations and the Company\'s
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).



(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period,
then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.



(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.13, Parent shall cause to be
provided to Acquisition Sub all of the funds necessary to purchase any shares
of Company Common Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Acquisition Sub to comply with, on a
timely basis, all of Acquisition Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement.



1.2 Company Actions.



(a) Subject to Section 5.3, the Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer and represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub that the
Company\'s board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held (the "Company
Board Meeting"), has unanimously: (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, taken together,
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company\'s
stockholders; (ii) determined that



neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is an "interested stockholder" as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL; (iii) approved and adopted this Agreement and
approved the Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL and resolved that the Merger is
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and that the Merger shall be
consummated as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time; (iv)
declared the advisability of this Agreement; (v) resolved to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and, to the
extent required to consummate the Merger, approve and adopt this Agreement
(the recommendation of the Company\'s board of directors that the stockholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and approve and adopt this Agreement being
referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); (vi) to the extent
necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the Company not
to be subject to any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder," "business combination" or similar restriction set
forth in any state takeover law or other Legal Requirement that might
otherwise apply to the Tender and Support Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and (vii) directed that the
approval and adoption of this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of
the Company, as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, if required
to consummate the Merger under the DGCL. Subject only to Section 5.3, the
Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents and the inclusion of the foregoing determinations in the Offer
Documents.



(b) Contemporaneously with the filing by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC and (contemporaneously with
the dissemination of the Offer Documents) disseminate to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D‑9")
that shall reflect the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
information required by Section 1.3(b), shall reflect that the Merger is
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be consummated as soon as
practicable following the completion of the Offer (which, subject to Section
7, shall be immediately following the Acceptance Time), and, subject only to
Section 5.3, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and the same
determinations and approvals of the Company\'s board of directors as set forth
in the Offer Documents in accordance with Section 1.2(a). The Company shall
also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion,
together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation
M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is applicable).
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule
14D-9 and the filing and dissemination thereof to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and with all
other applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and its legal counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to any such
reasonable comments. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and its legal
counsel upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly
provide Parent and its legal counsel with copies of all written correspondence
between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, or, if not in writing, a description of such communication. The
Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in preparing the proposed response of the Company to comments
received from the SEC or its staff and to provide comments on any proposed
response thereto, and the Company shall give due consideration to any such
reasonable comments. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company: (1)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9; and (2) to the
extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or by other
applicable Legal Requirements, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
to the extent that such information shall be or shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct
such information, to be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements, to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Offer that
may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.2(b).



(c) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent and Acquisition Sub: (i) a
list of the Company\'s stockholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of
securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, in each case true, correct and complete as of the most recent
practicable date; and (ii) such additional information (including updated
lists of stockholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) as Parent may reasonably request in connection
with the Offer or the Merger. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall hold in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in any such labels, lists,
listings, files and other information, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request of the Company, deliver (and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to
deliver) to the Company or destroy any and all copies and any extracts or
summaries of such information then in their possession or control. In
addition, in connection



with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause applicable third parties to cooperate with Parent
and Acquisition Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Company
Common Stock held in or subject to any Company Plan or Company Employee Plan.



1.3 Directors.



(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter
(including upon acceptance of Company Common Stock tendered during any
subsequent offering period), Parent shall be entitled to designate, to serve
on the Company\'s board of directors, the number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, determined by multiplying: (i) the total number of
directors on the Company\'s board of directors (giving effect to any increase
in the size of the Company\'s board of directors effected pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a)); by (ii) a fraction having a numerator equal to the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or
Acquisition Sub (including all shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer), and having a denominator equal to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding
(provided, however, that, in no event shall Parent\'s director designees
constitute less than a majority of the entire board of directors of the
Company after the Acceptance Time). The Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company\'s board of directors, including seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors and, if such resignations are not obtained, increasing the
size of the Company\'s board of directors. From and after the Acceptance Time,
to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on: (1) each committee of the Company\'s board of
directors; and (2) the board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof) that represents at least the same percentage as
individuals designated by Parent represent on the board of directors of the
Company. After the Acceptance Time, upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall
take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as
defined by Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 1.3, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that, at all times after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective
Time, at least two of the members of the Company\'s board of directors are
individuals who were directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement
("Continuing Directors"); each of whom shall be "independent directors" as
defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules; provided, however,
that: (x) if at any time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective
Time there shall be only one Continuing Director serving as a director of the
Company for any reason, then the Company\'s board of directors shall cause an
individual who satisfies the aforementioned independence requirements and
selected by the remaining Continuing Director to be appointed to serve on the
Company\'s board of directors (and such individual shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for all purposes under this Agreement); and (y) if at any
time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time no Continuing
Directors remain on the Company\'s board of directors, then the Company\'s
board of directors shall appoint two individuals who satisfy the
aforementioned independence requirements and who are not officers, employees
or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub to serve on the
Company\'s board of directors (and such individuals shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes under this Agreement).



(b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the
Company\'s board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. In connection with the
performance of its obligations to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company\'s board of directors, the Company shall promptly
take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require; provided, that the
Company\'s obligations under Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to the Company\'s
timely receipt of the information with respect to Parent and its nominees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Parent shall provide to the Company and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to, and shall
not limit, any right that Acquisition Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of
Acquisition Sub or Parent may have (with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise) under applicable Legal Requirements as a holder or beneficial
owner of shares of Company Common Stock.



(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees to the
Company\'s board of directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required to authorize any of the following actions of the Company (each, an
"Adverse Action"), in addition to the approvals by the Company Board or the
stockholders of the Company that may be required by the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company or applicable Legal Requirements,
including applicable stock exchange requirements, for the Company to: (i)
amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any
amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement; (ii) extend the time
of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Acquisition Sub under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the
Company\'s rights, benefits or remedies hereunder; (iii) except as expressly
provided herein, amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company; (iv) authorize or execute any Contract, or any amendment or
modification of any Contract, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates on the
other hand, or the termination of any such Contract then in effect; (v) make
any determination or give any approval or



authorization that is required to be taken or given by the Company\'s board of
directors with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on
behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; or; (vi) take any
other action or make any other determination of the Company\'s board of
directors under or in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions if such action would reasonably be expected to adversely to
affect the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than Parent or
Acquisition Sub); provided, however, that if there shall be no Continuing
Directors as a result of such individuals\' deaths, disabilities, resignations
or refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the
directors who are considered Independent Directors, or, if no such directors
are then in office, by a majority vote of the Company\'s board of directors.



1.4 Top-Up Option.



(a) Prior to the scheduled Acceptance Time, Parent and the Company shall
confer and mutually determine, in good faith, after consulting with their
respective outside legal counsel, whether the Merger remains eligible to be
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL. Unless Parent and the Company
determine that the Merger is ineligible to be effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL (the "251(h) Inapplicable Determination") the Merger shall
be effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company make a 251(h) Inapplicable
Determination then, contingent and effective upon the occurrence of the 251(h)
Inapplicable Determination and the Acceptance Time, the Company hereby grants
to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable
only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, to purchase
from the Company the number of newly-issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one share more than 90% of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then issued and
outstanding taking into account the issuance of all shares of Company Common
Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option.



(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Acquisition Sub from and after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (1) the Effective Time
and (2) the valid termination of this Agreement. The Top-Up Option may be
exercised by Acquisition Sub, if: (i) the 251(h) Inapplicable Determination
has been made; (ii) all of the Conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted) waived; (iii) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or
Acquisition Sub immediately following the Acceptance Time does not constitute
at least one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that are then issued and outstanding; (iv) the exercise of the Top-Up
Option would result in Parent or Acquisition Sub owning at least one share
more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then
issued and outstanding taking into account the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option; and (v)
the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with this Section 1.4 would
not violate any applicable Legal Requirements. The Top-Up Option shall not be
exercised if the number of shares of the Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but
unissued shares of the Company Common Stock that are not reserved or otherwise
committed to be issued. The Top-Up Option shall not be exercised if
Acquisition Sub has not accepted for payment all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn.



(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common
Stock being purchased by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall
be determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price.
Acquisition Sub shall pay the Company a portion of the purchase price equal to
the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The balance of such purchase price may be paid by
Acquisition Sub, at its election: (1) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; (2) by executing and delivering to the Company a
full recourse promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance
of the purchase price, or (3) partly in cash and partly by delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of
the purchase price not paid in cash. Any promissory note: (I) shall be
executed by Parent and Acquisition Sub; (II) shall be due and payable on the
first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery thereof; (III) shall
bear simple interest at the rate of 3% per annum, payable in arrears at the
time the promissory note is repaid; (IV) shall be full recourse against Parent
and Acquisition Sub; (V) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time
without premium or penalty; (VI) shall provide that the unpaid principal
amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall immediately become
due and payable in the event that (a) Parent or Acquisition Sub fails to make
any payment of interest on the promissory note as provided therein and such
failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (b) Parent or
Acquisition Sub files or has filed against it any petition under any
bankruptcy or insolvency Legal Requirements or makes a general assignment for
the benefit of creditors and shall have no other material terms; and (VII)
shall have no other material terms.



(d) Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that, in any
appraisal proceeding related to this Agreement, the fair value of the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the appraisal proceeding shall be
determined in



accordance with the DGCL without regard to the exercise by Acquisition Sub of
the Top-Up Option, any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option or the promissory note.



(e) In the event Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice (the "Top-Up Notice")
setting forth: (i) the manner in which Acquisition Sub intends to pay the
applicable purchase price; and (ii) the place and time at which the closing of
the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Acquisition Sub is to
take place. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of
such notice, notify Acquisition Sub of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that are then issued and outstanding and the number of Top-Up Shares as
of such time, and, upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Acquisition Sub the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. At the closing of
the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock, Acquisition Sub shall
cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such shares, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Acquisition Sub a certificate representing such shares.



(f) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that any Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act
and that all such Top-Up Shares shall be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Parent and
Acquisition Sub are, and shall be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
"accredited investors," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and shall
be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).



(g) The parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, including the payment
for such shares, to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed
received by the Company pursuant to Section 9.9, and if not so consummated on
such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. If the Top-Up Option is
exercised, the parties hereto further agree to use commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, as close in time as
possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall
cooperate to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished in
a manner consistent with all applicable Legal Requirements.



(h) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only
once and shall not be assigned by Parent or Acquisition Sub. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 1.4(h) shall be null and void.



Section 2. THE MERGER



2.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. At the Effective Time, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the

Inapplicable Determination, in which case no later than the second business

Requirements) waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions

be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements) waiver of those conditions) or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger

the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such later time as may be specified in such
certificate of merger with the consent of Parent (the time as of which the
Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time").





2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:



(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or
immediately thereafter to conform to the certificate of incorporation of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Volterra Semiconductor
Corporation" and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Legal Requirements;



(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at

and



(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



2.5 Conversion of Shares.



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:

(i)any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company (or held in the
Company\'s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii)any shares of Company Common Stock then held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii)any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(iv)except as provided in clauses "(i)," "(ii)" and "(iii)" above and subject
to Section 2.5(b), Section 2.6(e) and Section 2.7, each share of Company
Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price (the "Merger Price"), without interest thereon and subject to any
required Tax withholding; and

(v)each share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 (the "Pre-
Closing Period"), the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or if a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the Merger Price shall be appropriately adjusted.



2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company (the "Exchange Agent") to receive the funds for purposes of effecting
the payment and distribution of the Merger Price contemplated by Section
2.5(a)(iv). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash in an amount representing the
aggregate Merger Price payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iv) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, to be paid in respect of Stock
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares by the Exchange Agent in accordance with
this Agreement. Such funds deposited with the Exchange Agent are referred to
herein as the "Payment Fund." Such funds shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof
by the Exchange Agent to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, were record holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock ("Stock Certificates") or non-certificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"): (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (including



a provision confirming that delivery of Stock Certificates shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate or a Book-Entry Share to
the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Price
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iv) in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share; and (B) the Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Price
may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Stock
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if any such Stock Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and such
holder shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Payment of the Merger Price with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to a Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b), each
Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent solely the right to receive the Merger Price
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iv) for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition to the payment of
Merger Price pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iv), require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and
to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Stock
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.



(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date 180 days after the date
on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this Section 2.6 shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for payment pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iv). None
of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any cash amounts
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.



(d) At the Effective Time, holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.6.



(e) The Exchange Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation determines in good faith is
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other Legal Requirement. To
the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.



(f) If any Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i)
the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or
(ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the consideration that
such Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such consideration
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of
Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holder\'s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Price



in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iv), but shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.



(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to
have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the
right to receive the Merger Price in accordance with Section 2.5(a)(iv),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book-Entry
Share representing such shares in accordance with Section 2.6.



(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the

in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent
to such payment or settlement offer.



2.8 Company Equity Awards and Company Plans.



(a) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, has an exercise price per share less
than the Offer Price and is held by an individual who, after the Effective
Time, will be an "employee" of Parent or an Affiliate within the meaning of
General Instruction A(1)(a)(1) of Form S-8 shall be substituted with a
Substitute Option (as defined below) issued under Parent\'s stock plan (i) in
a manner that is in compliance with Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder in the case of a Company Option that is
intended to be an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422
of the Code, and in a manner that is in compliance with Section 409A of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) that shall
entitle its holder to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to the Company Option for which the Substitute Option was
substituted, (A) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to
the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock)
of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (2) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, (B) with a per share exercise price applicable to such
Substitute Option equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent)
arrived at by dividing (1) the per share exercise price of each Company Option
for which a Substitute Option was substituted by (2) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio (each, a "Substitute Option").



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company and the
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each Company Option
that is not being substituted with a Substitute Option and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and
exercisable no later than five (5) days prior to the Effective Time and, if
not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled immediately
following the Effective Time and thereupon converted into the right to receive
a cash amount equal to the Company Option Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock then subject to the Company Option, or, if the Company
Option Consideration with respect to any such Company Option shall be a
negative number, no such cash payment shall be due and owing with respect to
such Company Option. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
Company Option Consideration due and owing shall be paid, without interest, as
soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any Company Option Consideration otherwise payable to any
holder or former holder of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation determines are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law or under any other Legal Requirement. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Company Option Consideration, if any. For the avoidance
of doubt, each Company Option that is unvested and is not a Substitute Option
shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time if not
exercised prior to such time without payment other than the Company Option
Consideration in settlement therefor, and the Company shall take all necessary
action to provide for such cancellation and treatment.



(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by an
individual who, after the Effective Time, is a Continuing Employee shall be
substituted with a restricted stock unit issued under Parent\'s stock plan
that shall entitle its holder to acquire, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Company Restricted Stock Unit for which
the Substitute RSU (as defined below) was substituted, a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that is equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Parent Common Stock) of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(each, a "Substitute RSU").





(d) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action that may
be necessary to: (i) cause the offering period under the ESPP that is
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement to be terminated as of the fifth
business day prior to the Acceptance Time or the date such offering period
terminates by its terms, if earlier (such date, the "Final Purchase Date");
(ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period
as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of the Final Purchase Date) of each
outstanding purchase right under the ESPP; (iv) provide that no further
offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the
date hereof subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time; and (v) ensure
that no individual shall be permitted to make a new election to purchase
shares in any current offering period or increase his or her election to
purchase shares in any current offering period; provided, however, that the
actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of Offer. On such new exercise date, the
Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within
each participant\'s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Acceptance Time (and subject to
the consummation of the Offer), the Company shall terminate the ESPP.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the
terms of the Company Plans (other than the ESPP which is governed by Section
2.8(d)), and take any other actions, as are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary (under the Company
Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8.



2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the

respect to each Company Associate the Acquired Corporations have complied in
all material respects with the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder),the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, as amended (and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder), and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended (and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder). None of the Acquired
Corporations is or reasonably could be subject to either a liability pursuant
to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976
of the Code. For the last six years, the Acquired Corporations have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by them
under, are not in any material respect in default under or in violation of,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no default or violation by any
other party to, any Company Employee Plan.



(i) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or 4980B
of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement), neither
the Acquired Corporations nor any Company Employee Plan has any present or
future obligation to make any payment to, or with respect to, any present or
former employee, officer or director of the Acquired Corporations pursuant to
any retiree medical benefit plan or other retiree welfare plan.



(j) The consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (including in
combination with other events or circumstances) shall not (i) entitle any
current or former Company Associate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, in each case, in excess of $100,000 per
Company Associate, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any Company Associate, (iii)
directly or indirectly cause the Acquired Corporations to transfer or set
aside any material assets to fund any benefits under any Company Employee
Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any material liability under any Company
Employee Plan (v) limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate or transfer
any material assets of any Company Employee Plan on or following the Effective
Time or (vi) give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.



(k) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
material Foreign Plan is maintained (other than any employment, termination or
severance agreement for non-officer employees of any Acquired Corporation,
government mandated benefits, including consultation rights or notices, and
equity grant notices, and related documentation, with respect to employees of
any Acquired Corporation). Each Foreign Plan has been operated and maintained
in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with applicable
Legal Requirements (including any special provisions relating to qualified
plans where such Foreign Plan was intended to so qualify) and has been
maintained in good standing with the applicable regulatory authorities,
including obtaining from the Governmental Body having jurisdiction over such
Foreign Plan any required documentation that



such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the Legal Requirements of the relevant
jurisdiction if such determination is required to give effect to such Foreign
Plan. According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
for the purpose of funding each Foreign Plan (or, if the same has no such
assumptions and valuations or is unfunded or is not subject to statutory
funding requirements, according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations
prescribed by applicable local accounting standards and principles), as of
December 31, 2012, the total amount or value of the funds available under such
Foreign Plan to pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of
such accrued benefits, together with any reserve or accrual with respect
thereto, exceeded the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent)
accrued as of such date of all participants and past participants therein in
respect of which the Acquired Corporations have or would have after the
Effective Time any obligation.



(l) Each Company Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and
documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code, except for any instances
of noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the Acquired Corporations.



(m) The Acquired Corporations do not have an obligation to gross-up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any current or former service provider to the Acquired
Corporations for any Tax incurred by such service provider.



3.17 Environmental Matters. Each of the Acquired Corporations: (i) is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws;
(ii) possesses all material permits and other Governmental Authorizations
required under applicable Environmental Laws, and is, and has been at all
times, in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions
thereof; (iii) has not received since April 1, 2011 any notice, notification,
demand, request for information, citation, summons or order, and since April
1, 2011 no complaint: (x) has been filed against and served to any Acquired
Corporation or (y) to the knowledge of the Company filed against any Acquired
Company; and (iv) has no material liabilities or obligations of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or
otherwise arising under or relating to any Environmental Law or any Materials
of Environmental Concern, and there is no condition, situation or set of
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis
for any such liability or obligation, except for liabilities, obligations,
conditions, situations or sets of circumstances that do not constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Since August 1, 2008, there has been no
environmental investigation, study, audit, test, review or other analysis
conducted by the Company or on its behalf in relation to the current or prior
business of any Acquired Corporation or any property or facility now or
previously leased by any Acquired Corporation that has not been Made Available
to Parent at least one (1) business day prior to the date hereof. For purposes
of this Section 3.17, the term "Acquired Corporations" shall include any
entity that is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of any Acquired
Corporation.



3.18 Insurance. The Company has Made Available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all material insurance policies and all material self-
insurance programs and arrangements relating to the business, assets and
operations of the Acquired Corporations in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. Each such insurance policy is in full force and effect. No Acquired
Corporation has received any written notice or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other communication regarding any actual or anticipated: (i)
cancellation or invalidation of any insurance policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement; (ii) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material
claim under any insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement;
or (iii) material adjustment in the amount of the premiums payable with
respect to any insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
The Acquired Corporations maintain insurance with reputable insurers for the
business and assets of the Acquired Corporations against risks normally
insured against. There is no existing default or event which, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, by any insured
thereunder, except as does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Acquired Corporations have not reached or exceeded their policy limits for
any insurance policies in effect at any time during the past five years.



3.19 Transactions with Affiliates. Between the date of the Company\'s last
proxy statement filed with the SEC and the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred that would be required to be reported by the Company pursuant to

any of their respective properties or assets or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees in their capacities as such; (ii) against any

any material respect the right or ability of any Acquired Corporation or would
impose, after the Effective Time, any restriction in any material respect on

respective Affiliates: (A) to compete with any other Person; (B) to acquire
any product or other asset or any services from any other Person; (C) to
develop, sell, supply, distribute, offer, support or service any product or
any technology or other asset to or for any other Person; or (D) to perform
services for any other Person or (z) constitutes a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



3.21 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. The Company has all necessary
corporate right, power and authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement subject, in the case of the Merger, to
receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote (if required by the DGCL).

restrictions set forth in any state takeover law or other Legal Requirement
that might otherwise apply to the Tender and Support Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

to permit the consummation of the Merger, the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding on

Agreement and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and
assumptions set forth herein, the $23.00 per share of Company Common Stock in

negotiations with, any Person in response to (and in connection with) an

that did not result from a breach of the provisions of this Section 5.3 that
is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if: (i) the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting
with the Company\'s independent financial advisor and the Company\'s outside
legal counsel, that (y) such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer and
(z) failure to furnish any such non-public information to, or to enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board of

discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent
written notice of the identity of such Person and of the Company\'s intention

Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or amendment or modification to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
or amendment or modification thereto and providing to Parent an unredacted
copy of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or such amendment or
modification that, in each case, includes the material terms and conditions
thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on the status and
material details of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to the parenthetical in Section
5.3(b)(i)(A), an Acquired Corporation shall not be obligated to advise Parent
of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in the manner contemplated
by the prior sentences if doing so would violate any written agreement (each,
a "Restrictive Agreement") between the Company and a third party (a
"Restricted Third Party") that was entered into prior to August 12, 2013.



(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each other Acquired Corporation and any
Representatives acting on behalf of any Acquired Corporation to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Person that relate to any Acquisition

of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, permit the withdrawal
or modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or resolve, agree or propose to take
any of the actions contemplated by this clause "(i)" (any action described in
this clause "(i)" being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or
(ii) approve, endorse, accept or recommend, or publicly propose to approve,
endorse, accept or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar document or Contract (whether binding or
nonbinding) constituting or relating to, or that is intended to, contemplates
or is reasonably likely to result in, an Acquisition Transaction, other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement , or resolve, agree or propose to take
any of the actions contemplated by this clause "(ii)."





(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(f) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and
thereafter may cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1(e) and, concurrently with such termination, cause the Company
to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement in accordance and
subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(e), in each case, if:
(i) a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of the provisions of this Section 5.3 is made to the Company and is not
withdrawn; (ii) the Company\'s board of directors determines in good faith,
after consulting with the Company\'s independent financial advisor and the
Company\'s outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Offer; (iii) the Company\'s board of directors determines in good
faith, after consulting with the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Offer, failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or failure to take action pursuant to Section 8.1(e) would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board
of directors under applicable Delaware Legal Requirements; (iv) prior to
effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or taking action pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), the Company\'s board of directors shall have given Parent at
least four business days\' prior written notice: (A) that it has received a
Superior Offer; (B) that it intends to consider making an Adverse
Recommendation Change or take action pursuant to Section 8.1(e) as a result of
such Superior Offer; and (C) providing to Parent an unredacted copy of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such proposed action, including the
identity of the Person making such offer (it being understood and agreed that
any change to the consideration payable in connection with such Superior Offer
or any other modification of a material term thereof shall require a new
advance written notice by the Company (except that the four business day
period referred to above shall be reduced to two business days)) together with
any documents providing for financing commitment related to such Superior
Offer (including any redacted fee letter provided to the Company); (v) during
any such notice period(s), the Company engages (to the extent requested by
Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such
a manner that such Superior Offer would no longer constitute a Superior Offer
(it being understood that the Company shall not enter into any Specified
Definitive Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer during
such notice period(s)); and (vi) at the time of any Adverse Recommendation
Change and the taking of action pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting with the
Company\'s the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or the failure to take action pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) would still be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board of directors under applicable
Delaware Legal Requirements in light of such Superior Offer (taking into
account any changes to the terms and provisions of this Agreement proposed by
Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(v)" or otherwise).
If following the execution by the parties hereto of an amendment to this
Agreement providing for revisions to the terms and provisions of the
Contemplated Transactions that obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation
Change and the taking of actions pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the Company
receives another Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, then the
provisions of this Section 5.3(g) shall be again be applicable.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(f) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, if:
(i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material
event, material development or material change in circumstances that does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Inquiry that was not
known by the Company\'s board of directors on the date of this Agreement,
which event, development or change in circumstance becomes known to the
Company\'s board of directors prior to the Acceptance Time and is materially
more favorable to the recurring financial condition of the Acquired
Corporations, taken as a whole, other than (A) developments or changes in the
semiconductor industry, (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of
the Company Common Stock, (C) the timing of any approval of any Governmental
Authority required for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (D)
the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds internal or published
projections or (E) as a result of any development with respect to, or
resolution of (whether by settlement, dismissal, order, judgment, injunction
or otherwise) of any pending Legal Proceeding (any such material event,
material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry being referred to as an
"Intervening Event"); (ii) the Company\'s board of directors determines in
good faith, after consulting with the Company\'s independent financial advisor
and the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening
Event, failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board
of directors under applicable Delaware Legal Requirements (iii) no Adverse
Recommendation Change has been made for four business days after receipt by
Parent of a written notice from the Company setting forth a description of
such Intervening Event in reasonable detail and confirming that the Company\'s
board of directors has determined that the failure to make such an Adverse
Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board
of directors under applicable Delaware Legal Requirements; (iv) during such
four business day notice period, the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed
of all material developments with respect to such Intervening Event and
engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event would no
longer be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company\'s board of directors under applicable Delaware Legal
Requirements; and (v) at the time of any Adverse Recommendation Change, the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting
with the Company\'s independent financial advisor and the Company\'s outside
legal counsel, that the failure to



make an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company\'s board of
directors under applicable Delaware Legal Requirements in light of such
Intervening Event (taking into account any changes to the terms and provisions
of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required
by clause "(iv)" or otherwise).



(i) None of the Acquired Corporations shall grant a waiver or release under
any other standstill agreement in effect as of the date hereof or amend,
modify or grant permission under any provision thereof, provided, however,
that the Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver or release under any
standstill agreement in effect on the date hereof solely to the extent
necessary to permit the Person subject to the standstill agreement to make and
engage in discussions with respect to, and negotiate, consistent with the
terms and provisions of this Section 5.3, an Acquisition Proposal from such
Person that was made in circumstances not involving a breach of this Section
5.3, if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consulting with the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company\'s board of directors under applicable Delaware Legal
Requirements. The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the waiver
or release of any standstill by the Company promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) following such waiver or release, which notice shall include the
identity of the Person or group receiving the waiver or release).



(j) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from: (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consulting with
the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company\'s board of directors under applicable Delaware Legal Requirements;
provided, however, that (x) this Section 5.3(i) shall not be deemed to permit
the Company\'s board of directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
except as provided in Section 5.3(g) and Section 5.3(h) and (y) any such
position or disclosure in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer,
other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, in each case that includes reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation and a reaffirmation of the approval by the Company\'s board of
directors of the Contemplated Transactions shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change.



(k) Any breach or violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3
by any Acquired Corporation or any of their respective Representatives shall
be deemed to be a breach or violation of this Section 5.3 by the Company.



Section 6. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

appropriate actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as

adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"), and shall
prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials which shall
constitute the Proxy Statement. The filing of the Proxy Statement shall be

Company, with the written consent of Parent, may adjourn or postpone the

represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Requirement); (iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information; and (iv) promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white
papers, opinions, proposals and other submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental
Body related solely to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.2, Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.2
as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or otherwise reasonably redact highly
confidential content from the materials produced to the other.



(c) Unless prohibited by Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, each of
Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of:
(i) any communication from any official of any Governmental Body in connection
with any filing made pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) knowledge of the
commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Body with respect to the Contemplated Transactions (and shall
keep the other party informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or
threat); and (iii) any request by any official of any Governmental Body for
any amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or
any information required to comply with any Legal Requirements applicable to
the Contemplated Transactions. Parent shall be entitled to direct any defense
of the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. Unless
prohibited by Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to Section 6.2(a), Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, shall (promptly upon learning of the occurrence of such event) inform the
other of the occurrence of such event and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Body such amendment or supplement.





(d) Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement: (i)
shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be
made and given by such party in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions; and (iii) shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by the United States Department of Justice or United
States Federal Trade Commission under antitrust or competition-related Legal
Requirement in order to avoid entry of any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent
the Closing by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall any Acquired Corporation without the prior written
consent of Parent agree or offer to: (A) effect any divestiture of, or hold
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or agree to
restrict its ownership or operation of, any business or assets of the Acquired
Corporations, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, including Acquisition Sub,
or to enter into any settlement or consent decree, or agree to any
undertaking, with respect to any business or assets of the Acquired
Corporations, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, including Acquisition Sub,
(B) enter into, amend or agree to enter into or amend, any Contract of the
Acquired Corporations, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, including
Acquisition Sub, that imposes any material limitations on the ability of
Parent or any of its Affiliates to effectively exercise full rights of the
shares of Company Common Stock or (C) otherwise waive, abandon or alter any
material rights or material obligations of the Acquired Corporations, Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent, including Acquisition Sub. Furthermore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in connection with
obtaining any Consent from any third party, without the prior written consent
of Parent, none of the Acquired Corporations or any of their respective
Representatives, shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such
Person.



6.3 Employee Benefits.



(a) Except as set forth herein, the Company shall not take (or cause or permit
to be taken) any action to terminate any Company Employee Plan, including any
such plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "401(k) Plan"); provided, however, that if
directed in writing by Parent not less than five business days prior to the
Effective Time and, with respect to each 401(k) Plan, within five business
days prior to the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, the Company shall
take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by Parent to be
necessary or appropriate to terminate any such Company Employee Plan, with
such termination effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
(and, in the case of the 401(k) Plan, with such termination effective as of
the day immediately preceding the date that Parent and the Company become part
of the same controlled group pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code). In the event that Parent provides such written notice to the
Company, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that all 401(k)
Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors
of the Company or applicable Acquired Corporation, as the case may be. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the prior review
and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
request.



(b) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate the annual
management bonus plan of the Company as set forth as Exhibit 10.2 to the
Company\'s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 25, 2013,
with such termination effective as of the Acceptance Time, and to pay as
promptly as practicable possible following December 31, 2013 all amounts
accrued or otherwise earned under such annual management bonus plan through
the Acceptance Time, provided that a participant is employed by the Company
(including for such purpose Parent or any controlled affiliate thereof)
through December 31, 2013; provided, however, that in the event any
participant is terminated by the Company (including for such purpose Parent or
any controlled affiliate thereof) for any reason other than cause prior to
December 31, 2013, such participant shall be paid such amount on the date of
termination..



(c) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject
to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal
Requirements: (i) all employees of the Acquired Corporations who are citizens
of the United States of America or are otherwise legally employed in the
United States of America and who continue their employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate in
Parent\'s employee benefit plans, including its bonus, severance, health,
welfare, vacation and retirement plans (the "Parent Employee Plans"), to
substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; (ii)
for purposes of determining a Continuing Employee\'s eligibility to
participate in Parent Employee Plans (except Parent\'s service years program),
such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for his or her
years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior to the
Effective Time to the same extent as such service was recognized under any
analogous Company Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (iii) for purposes of each Parent Employee Plan



providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision
benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
Parent Employee Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents; and (iv) to the extent the Closing occurs on or prior to December
31, 2013, in lieu of its obligations set forth in clause "(iii)" of this
sentence, Parent shall be entitled to cause any Company Employee Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision
benefits to remain in effect through December 31, 2013.



(d) To the extent any employee notification or employee consultation
requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, the Company and Parent shall cooperate to ensure
that such notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to
the Acceptance Time or Effective Time, as applicable. Prior to the Effective
Time, no Acquired Corporation shall communicate with Continuing Employees
regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing employee
benefits and compensation, without the prior written approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



(e) Nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to make any employee of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries a third
party beneficiary of this Section 6.3 or provide any such employee any rights
relating hereto.



6.4 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.



(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and each Company Subsidiary in
favor of those Persons who are former or current directors and officers of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement and any
Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary prior to the Control Time (the "Indemnified Persons") for their
acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring prior to the Control
Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
or of a Company Subsidiary (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or,
with respect to any Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary, as of the Control Time, to the extent such agreement is
substantially the same as the indemnification agreements in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) and as provided in any indemnification agreements
between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and said Indemnified Persons (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) Made Available to Parent, which
obligations shall survive the Merger, are hereby assumed by the Surviving
Corporation and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years from the Effective Time and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section
6.4 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person. It is
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this Section 6.4 applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.4, each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.4.



(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons
with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement in the form disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO Policy"), covering each Person
covered by the Existing DandO Policy, on terms with respect to the coverage and
amounts that are equivalent to those of the Existing DandO Policy; provided,
however, that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing
DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO
Policy or substitute policy in excess of the dollar amount set forth in Part
6.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Maximum Premium"). In the event any
future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy or substitute policy exceed
the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to, and
Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a pre-paid,
non-cancellable "tail" policy reasonably satisfactory to Parent on the
Existing DandO Policy for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years
from the Effective Time and otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less
favorable than the terms and conditions of the Existing DandO Policy; provided,
however, that the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, expend an amount for such tail policy in excess of the Maximum
Premium. If such "tail" policy is purchased, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 6.4(b) for so long as
such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns:
(i) consolidates or merges with any other Person that shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper



provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.4.



6.5 Public Announcement. Parent and the Company agree that the press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint
release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any press release or other public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
before issuing any such press release or public statement; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to: (a) any press release or public
statement made with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions that is not inconsistent with, or more expansive in
any material respect than, any prior press release or public statement validly
made in accordance with this Section 6.5; (b) any press release or other
public statement as may be required by any applicable Legal Requirement; or
(c) any Adverse Recommendation Change.



6.6 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in (but not control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its officers or directors relating to
any of the Contemplated Transactions in accordance with the terms of a
mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement. The Company may not enter into
any settlement agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors or officers relating to any of the Contemplated
Transactions without Parent\'s prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



6.7 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock and Company Options in connection with the Merger by each officer
or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.



6.8 Resignation of Directors. Upon the written request of Parent (which shall
be given at least five Business Days before the Closing) and subject to the
provisions of Section 1.3, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent at
the Closing (effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation of each
director of the Acquired Corporations.



6.9 Rule 14d−10 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting
through the board of directors of the Company or its compensation committee)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
14d−10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement entered into on or after the
date hereof by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with
current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company and its
Affiliates and to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe
harbor provisions of such rule.



6.10 Delisting. From the Acceptance Time to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to enable
the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from
the Nasdaq Stock Market and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.



6.11 Additional Documents. As soon as commercially practicable following the
date hereof, the Company shall use best efforts to deliver to Parent the valid
assignment of invention agreements for each Company Associate identified in
Part 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, which agreements cover all Company
Intellectual Property conceived, authored, invented, developed or reduced to
practice by such Company Associate during the term of any and all periods of
employment with the Company.

the satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following
conditions:

by the Required Company Stockholder Vote.



7.2 No Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have
been issued by any court or other Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
and remain in effect, and there shall not be any Legal Requirement enacted or
deemed applicable to the Merger that makes consummation



of the Merger illegal; provided, however, that prior to invoking this Section
7.2, a party shall have taken all actions expressly required of such party
under this Agreement to have any such injunction, order or Legal Requirement
or other prohibition lifted.



7.3 Consummation of Offer. Acquisition Sub shall have accepted for payment and

the Acceptance Time;



(b) by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time

payment for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer; or (B) the
Merger; or (ii) making the acquisition of or payment for shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, or the consummation of the Merger,
illegal; provided, however, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if the issuance of such order,
decree or ruling or the taking of such action is attributable to the failure
of such party to perform any covenant in this Agreement required to be
performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time;



(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to March 14, 2014 (the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur

Triggering Event shall have occurred;



(e) subject to the Company\'s compliance with Section 5.3(g), by the Company

Company shall have failed to comply with or perform its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in

failure to comply with or perform the Company\'s covenants or agreements is
curable by the Company prior to the earlier of the Outside Date or 20 days
after the date on which the Company is notified by Parent in writing of such
inaccuracy or failure to comply with or perform; and (B) the Company is
continuing to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
failure to comply with or perform, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) on account of such inaccuracy or failure
to perform: (1) during such 20-day (or shorter) period; or (2) after such
20-day period, if such inaccuracy or failure to comply with or perform shall
have been fully cured in a manner that does not result in a breach of any

Parent\'s representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall have
been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become

however, that Parent and the Company shall share equally all fees and

Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, announced, commenced,
submitted or made and not withdrawn; and (B) within twelve (12) months after
the date of any such termination, an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not

agreement contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to
such Acquisition Proposal) is

Acquisition Transaction is consummated or such definitive agreement is
executed, the Termination Fee and the Transaction Expenses. For purposes of
this Section 8.3(b)(i),the term "Acquisition Transaction" shall have the
meaning set forth in Exhibit A, except that all references to "20% or more"

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3, are an integral part of
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Acquisition Sub would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay when due
any amounts payable under this Section 8.3, the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amounts and the
enforcement by Parent of its rights under this Section 8.3.



Section 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



9.1 Amendment. Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be amended with
the approval of the respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent

privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such
power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any
such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party
shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of
such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and
any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.
