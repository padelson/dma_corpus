Schedule     -iii-     5     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 4, 2001 (this "Agreement"),
is by and among Suiza Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Blackhawk Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Dean Foods Company, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), will merge with and
into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), and pursuant thereto, the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration set forth herein;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of
the Company has determined that the Merger is advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and has approved and
adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;   WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Merger is advisable,
fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders and has
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and
adopted this Agreement and Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
will adopt this Agreement promptly after the execution hereof by the parties
hereto;   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a)(1)(A) and Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the United States Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01. The
Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including Section 2.01(b)), and in accordance with Delaware Law,
at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), the Company will be
merged with and into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company will cease and Merger Sub will
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section
9.03.    Page 1  6    SECTION 1.02. Closing; Closing Date; Effective
Time. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section
8.01, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, the consummation of the Merger and the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place
at the offices of Hughes and Luce, L.L.P., 1717 Main Street, Dallas, Texas as
soon as practicable (but in any event within two business days) after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, or at such
other date, time and place as Parent and the Company may agree; provided,
that the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or
waived at or prior to such time. The date on which the Closing takes place is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date." As promptly as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the date and time of such filing,
or such later date or time agreed upon by Parent and the Company and set
forth therein, being the "Effective Time").   SECTION 1.03. Effect of the
Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will be as provided
in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Merger Sub will
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and the Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.04. Certificate of Incorporation;
Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and thereafter will
continue to be its certificate of incorporation until amended as provided
therein and pursuant to Delaware Law. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and thereafter will continue to be its bylaws until amended as
provided therein and pursuant to Delaware Law.   SECTION 1.05. Directors and
Officers. The directors of Merger Sub will be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.01 Merger Consideration; Conversion and
Cancellation of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
or their respective stockholders:      Page 2  7   (a) Subject to the
other provisions of this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any
Company Common Stock described in Section 2.01(d)) will be converted into the
right to receive (i) $21.00 in cash (as may be adjusted in accordance with
Section 2.01(b), the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) 0.429 (as may be adjusted
in accordance with Section 2.01(b), the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common
stock, $.01 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (such Cash
Consideration and Parent Common Stock collectively, the "Per Share Merger
Consideration").   (b) If on the day upon which the Effective Time occurs
(or if no trading of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the
"NYSE") takes place prior to the Effective Time on such day, the last date
prior to the date upon which the Effective Time occurs upon which there was
trading of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE), the fair market value, based on
the volume weighted average per share sales price of the Parent Common Stock
on that day on the NYSE ("Parent Common Stock Closing Price"), of all shares
of Parent Common Stock to be delivered in connection with the Merger, minus
the product of (x) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000 (the
"Total Stock Value") would be (but for adjustments made pursuant to this
Section 1.01(b)) less than 40% of the sum of (i) the number of the Converted
Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(e)) multiplied by the Cash Consideration,
(ii) the amount of cash paid by Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock within the two year period prior to
the date of the Merger, (iii) the Total Stock Value, (iv) the number of
Dissenting Shares, multiplied by the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and
(B) the product of the Exchange Ratio (prior to any adjustment) and the
Parent Common Stock Closing Price, and (v) the product of (x) the Parent
Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000 (such sum being referred to as the
"Total Merger Consideration") then the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Consideration shall be adjusted as follows: The adjusted Exchange Ratio shall
be equal to (i) the sum of (A) 40% of the dollar amount of the Total Merger
Consideration determined as provided in the preceding sentence and (B) the
product of (x) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000,
divided by (ii) the product of (A) the number of Converted Shares and (B) the
Parent Common Stock Closing Price, and the adjusted Cash Consideration shall
be equal to (i) 60% of the dollar amount of the Total Merger Consideration as
determined above, minus the sum of (A) the amount of cash paid by Parent
and/or any of its subsidiaries to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
within the two year period prior to the date of the Merger, (B) the number of
Dissenting Shares, multiplied by the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration (prior
to any adjustment) and (y) the product of the Exchange Ratio (prior to any
adjustment) and the Parent Common Stock Closing Price, and (C) the product of
(x) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price and (y) 20,000, divided by (ii) the
number of Converted Shares.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection
(a), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock will have
been changed into a different number of shares by reason of any dividend
payable in stock, split, combination or similar event, the Per Share Merger
Consideration will be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, split, combination or similar event.      Page 3  8   (d)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) each
share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or owned by
any subsidiary of the Company, and each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto, and (ii) each
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a stockholder who has
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and such stockholder will be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of each such share in accordance with the provisions
of ss. 262 of Delaware Law unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect
or will have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal
and payment in accordance with Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time,
any stockholder holding Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or shall have
effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such appraisal right, such shares of
Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is
entitled, without any interest thereon. The Company will give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Common Stock and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent will have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.  
(e) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and retired, and each certificate previously
evidencing Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Company Common Stock described in Section
2.01(d)) (the "Converted Shares") will thereafter represent the right to
receive, subject to Section 2.03(c), that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and the Cash Consideration determined pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (the
"Merger Consideration") and, if applicable, cash pursuant to Section 2.03(c).
The owners of certificates previously evidencing Converted Shares will cease
to have any rights with respect to such Converted Shares except as otherwise
provided herein or by law. Such certificates previously evidencing Converted
Shares will be exchanged for certificates evidencing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.03, without interest. No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger and, in lieu
thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.03(c).   (f)
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.      Page 4  9   SECTION 2.02 Treatment of Stock Options
and Other Equity-Based Awards.   (a) Each outstanding option to purchase,
stock appreciation right, phantom stock award, or performance share award
(other than performance share awards which are generally payable in cash)
relating to Company Common Stock (collectively, a "Company Common Stock
Award") granted prior to the Effective Time and which remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock and will be converted (as so
converted, a "Company Converted Stock Award"), at the Effective Time, into an
option to acquire, stock appreciation right, phantom stock award, or
performance share award (other than performance share awards which are
generally payable in cash) relating to, as applicable, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Common Stock Award (but
taking into account any change thereto, including the acceleration
thereof provided for in the applicable Company stock option plan or in any
award agreement by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
multiplying (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Common Stock Award by (b) the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii)
the Cash Consideration per share divided by the closing price for a share of
Parent Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the last trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (such sum, the "Stock Award Exchange
Ratio") (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock). The exercise price per share for each share of Parent Common Stock
subject to such Company Converted Stock Award will be equal to the per share
exercise price specified in the Company Common Stock Award divided by the
Stock Award Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Company Common Stock Award
to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option will be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code. Performance share awards which are generally payable in cash, but
which permit the holder to elect receipt of shares (as provided in the
applicable grant agreement), shall be converted into a right to elect
to receive new shares of Parent Common Stock.   (b) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be included under a
registration statement on Form S-8 of Parent all shares of Parent Common
Stock which are subject to Company Converted Stock Awards, and shall maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement until all Company Converted
Stock Awards have been exercised, expired or forfeited.   SECTION 2.03.
Exchange and Surrender of Certificates.   (a) As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, each record holder of certificates previously evidencing
Converted Shares will be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.03(e) below) to issue and pay, as
applicable, to each such record holder or to such persons as such holder may
request upon surrender of such certificates to the Exchange Agent, (i) a
certificate or certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the Converted Shares so surrendered will have been
converted as aforesaid, in such denominations and registered in such names as
such holder       Page 5  10  may request, and (ii) the Cash
Consideration into which the Converted Shares so surrendered will have been
converted. If such holder would otherwise be entitled to fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, such holder will upon surrender of the certificates
representing such shares held as aforesaid, be paid an amount in cash in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.03(c). Until so surrendered and
exchanged, each certificate previously evidencing Converted Shares will
represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional shares. Unless and until any such certificates will be so
surrendered and exchanged, no dividends or other distributions payable to the
holders of record of Parent Common Stock as of any time on or after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of record of Converted
Shares; provided, however, that Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent
any such dividends or other distributions payable with respect to the Parent
Common Stock represented by any unsurrendered certificates evidencing
Converted Shares, and upon any such surrender and exchange of such
certificates, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the holders of
record of Converted Shares (i) the amount, without interest thereon, of
dividends and other distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (b) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued and all
Cash Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of certificates
previously representing Converted Shares in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03(c)) will be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Converted
Shares. At and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates that
previously evidenced Converted Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.   (c) No certificates or scrip evidencing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the owner
thereof, upon surrender of such certificate for exchange pursuant to this
Article II, an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest
cent, determined by multiplying (i) the Closing Price by (ii) the fractional
interest to which the owner thereof would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all Converted Shares held of record by such owner and all full
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in respect thereof).   (d) Parent will
be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Converted Shares such amounts as Parent (or any affiliate thereof)
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former       Page 6  11  holder of the Converted Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.   (e) At or prior
to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company as agent for the holders of Converted
Shares (the "Exchange Agent") to receive and disburse the Merger
Consideration to which holders of Converted Shares become entitled pursuant
to Section 2.01. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub or Parent will provide the
Exchange Agent with sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock and sufficient
cash to allow the Merger Consideration to be paid by the Exchange Agent for
each share of Company Common Stock then entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration (collectively, the "Payment Fund").   (f) Promptly
after the Effective Time, Merger Sub or Parent will cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each record holder of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Converted Shares (the
"Certificates"), a form of letter of transmittal (which will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment.   (i) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a 
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly  executed and
completed in accordance with its instructions and  such other documents as
may be requested, the holder of such  Certificate will be entitled to receive
in exchange for such  Certificate, subject to any required withholding of
taxes, the  Merger Consideration and such Certificate will forthwith be 
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger  Consideration
upon the surrender of the Certificates.   (ii) If payment or delivery is to
be made to a person  other than the person in whose name the Certificate 
surrendered is registered, it will be a condition of payment  and delivery
that the Certificate so surrendered be properly  endorsed, with signature
properly guaranteed, or otherwise be  in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting  such payment and delivery pay any transfer or other
taxes  required by reason of the payment or delivery to a person  other than
the registered holder of the Certificate  surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving  Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.   (iii) Subject to Section 2.01(d), until surrendered  in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03, each  Certificate (other
than Certificates held by persons referred  to in Sections 2.01(d)(i) and
2.01(d)(ii)) will represent for  all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable Merger  Consideration, without interest and subject to any
required  withholding of taxes.   (g) Promptly following the date that is
one year after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will return to the
Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other property in its
possession that constitute any portion of the Payment Fund, and the duties of
the Exchange Agent will terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate

AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby represents and warrants
to the Parent and Merger Sub that, except as disclosed in the Company Reports
(as defined in Section 3.07(a)) filed prior to the date of this
Agreement:   SECTION 3.01. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation, limited

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than where the
failure to be so duly qualified and in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" as used
in this Agreement shall mean any change or effect that, individually or when
taken together with all other such changes or effects, would be materially
adverse to the business, operations, assets, financial condition, or results
of operations      Page 8  13  of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided, that none of the following shall be deemed in and
of themselves to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into

Effect: (i) any change in the market price or trading volume of the capital
stock of the Company after the date hereof, (ii) the suspension of trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock
Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market, (iii) any adverse change, event,
development or offset arising from or relating to (A) general business or
economic conditions or (B) general business or economic conditions relating
to any industries in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries participates, in each case which is not specific to the Company

Company consists of (i) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock par value $1.00

outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and has not been
issued in violation of (nor are any of the authorized shares of capital stock
of the Company subject to) any preemptive or similar rights created by
statute, the charter or bylaws of the Company, or any agreement to which the
Company is a party or bound. The outstanding shares of capital stock of the
subsidiaries of the Company are owned, of record and beneficially, by the
Company or another subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all security
interests, liens, pledges or charges.   (b) Except as set forth in the
disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company (the "Company

subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to grant,
issue or sell any shares of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by sale, lease, license or otherwise. Except as set forth in the

guarantee with respect to the obligations of, any other person, other than
advances to subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Except
as described in the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries (x) directly or indirectly owns, (y) has agreed to
purchase or otherwise acquire or (z) holds any interest        Page
9  14  convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any material

therewith, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. There are no material
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings to which the

environment by the Company or its subsidiaries or  in connection with their
properties or operations that would give rise  to any claim against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries for damages  or compensation, other than
any such exposure or release as would not  have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental Laws"
shall mean any and all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules,
regulations, permits or orders of any Governmental Entity pertaining to
health or the environment currently in effect in any and all jurisdictions in
which the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, as

directed that the Merger be submitted for consideration by the Company\'s

Agreement is the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon represented, in
person or by proxy, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, in accordance
with the rules of the NYSE and Delaware Law (the "Requisite Company
Stockholder Vote").   SECTION 3.17. Brokers. Except for the fees payable to

such firm will be entitled to any payment or indemnification relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 3.18. Takeover
Provisions. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Merger and
this Agreement, and such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Section 203 of Delaware Law and Article EIGHT of the Company\'s Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. Except as otherwise disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no other "fair price" "moratorium", "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation,
charter provision or contract that relates to or includes "fair price,"

Page 18  23   SECTION 3.19. Insurance. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries is currently insured, and has been insured, for reasonable

similarly situated would, in accordance with good business practice,
customarily be insured.   SECTION 3.20. Certain Material Contracts. As of
the date hereof and except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
as disclosed in the Company Reports, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contracts" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K); (ii) any material
joint ventures, partnerships, or similar arrangements; (iii) other agreements
or arrangements that give rise to a right of the other parties thereto to
terminate such material contract or to a right of first refusal or similar
right thereunder as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; (iv) any material employment, consulting, severance or
termination agreement with any director, officer, employee, agent or
consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (v) any material
severance programs, policies, plans or arrangements to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is obligated, whether or not written (except that any
of such items that are imposed by applicable Law need not be disclosed on the
Company Disclosure Schedule); or (vi) any agreements, licenses or other
arrangements that could, after the Effective Time, restrict Parent or any of
its affiliates or any successor thereto, from engaging in or competing with
any line of business or in any geographic area (collectively, the "Company
Material Contracts"). All Company Material Contracts are valid and in full
force and effect except to the extent they have previously expired in
accordance with their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default under the provisions of, any Company Material Contract,
except in each case for those violations and defaults which would not result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.21. Principal Customers
and Suppliers. The Company has made available to Parent a list of the ten
largest customers by approximate dollar volume of the Company and its
subsidiaries (the "Largest Customers") and the ten largest suppliers by
approximate dollar volume of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Largest
Suppliers"), with the amount of revenues or payments, as applicable,
attributable to each such customer and supplier for the Company\'s 1999 and
2000 fiscal years and the first nine months of its 2001 fiscal year. Except
as described in the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the
Largest Customers or Largest Suppliers has terminated or materially altered
its relationship with the Company since the beginning of the Company\'s 2001
fiscal year, or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened to do so or
otherwise notified the Company of any intention to do so, except for any such
terminations or alterations as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.      Page 19  24   SECTION 3.22. Intellectual Property.  
(a) The Company and its subsidiaries own, or have the right to use without
infringing or violating the rights of any third parties, except where such
infringement or violation has not had, or would not have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: (i) each trademark, trade name, brand name, service mark or
other trade designation owned or licensed by or to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, each patent, copyright and similar intellectual property
owned or licensed to or by the Company and each license, royalty, assignment
or other similar agreement and each registration and application relating to
the foregoing that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and (ii) each agreement relating to
technology, know-how or processes that the Company or its subsidiaries is
licensed or authorized to use, or which it licenses or authorizes others to
use, that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "Company Intellectual
Property"). No consent of third parties will be required for the use of the
Company Intellectual Property after the Effective Time, except as set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or where the failure to obtain such
consent would not have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been
asserted by any person against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
regarding the ownership of or the right to use any Company Intellectual
Property or challenging the rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
with respect to any of the Company Intellectual Property which would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the Company\'s knowledge, no person or entity has
asserted any claim that any product, activity or operation of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries infringes upon or involves, or has resulted in the
infringement of, any proprietary right of such person or entity, except for
such infringement which has not had or would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and no proceedings have been instituted, are pending or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, are threatened which challenge the rights of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect thereto, which would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.23. Opinion of Financial
Advisor. The Company has received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of the Company Common Stock in
the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.  
SECTION 3.24. Rights Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent a
true and complete copy of the Company\'s Rights Agreement in effect on the
date hereof. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in
a "Distribution Date" as defined in such Rights Agreement or the triggering
of any other right or entitlement of the Company\'s stockholders under such
Rights Agreement.   SECTION 3.25. Information Supplied.   (a) None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4 (as defined in Section 6.02)
will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material       Page
20  25  fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (B) the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company or Parent or at the time of the meeting of the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. With regard to the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, such information will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.   (b) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.25, no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on
information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND
MERGER SUB   Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, hereby represent
and warrant to the Company that, except as disclosed in the Parent Reports
(as defined in Section 4.07) filed prior to the date of this Agreement:  
SECTION 4.01. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of Parent
and its subsidiaries is a corporation, limited partnership or
limited liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, has all requisite corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than where the
failure to be so duly qualified and in good standing would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" as used in
this Agreement shall mean any change or effect that, individually or when
taken together with all other such changes or effects, would be materially
adverse to the business, operations, assets, financial condition, or results
of operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided,
that none of the following shall be deemed in and of themselves to
constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (i) any
change in the market price or trading volume of the capital stock of the
Parent after the date hereof, (ii) the suspension of trading in securities
generally on the NYSE or the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National
Market, (iii) any adverse change, event, development or offset arising from
or relating to (A) general business or economic conditions or (B) general
business or economic conditions relating to any industries in which the
Parent or any of its subsidiaries participates, in each case which is not
specific to the Parent and its subsidiaries, and (iv) any adverse
change, event,       Page 21  26  development or effect arising from
or relating to any change in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.   SECTION 4.02. Charter and Bylaws. Parent has heretofore
furnished to the Company complete and correct copies of the charter and the
bylaws, in each case as amended or restated, of Parent. Parent is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its charter or bylaws.   SECTION
4.03. Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
of (i) 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock par value $.01 per share, and
(ii) 500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock. As of March 31, 2001,
27,455,865 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding and no
shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and has not been issued in violation of
(nor are any of the authorized shares of capital stock of Parent subject to)
any preemptive or similar rights created by statute, the charter or bylaws of
Parent, or any agreement to which Parent is a party or bound. Except as set
forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the subsidiaries of Parent are owned, of record and beneficially, by
Parent or another subsidiary of Parent, free and clear of all security
interests, liens, pledges or charges.   (b) Except as set forth in the
disclosure schedule delivered to the Company (the "Parent Disclosure
Schedule"), there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character (including stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock or similar rights, arrangements or commitments) to
which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or obligating
Parent or any of its subsidiaries to grant, issue or sell any shares of the
capital stock of Parent or any of its subsidiaries by sale, lease, license or
otherwise. Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are
no material obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the
capital stock of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) provide funds to,
or make any investment in (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise), or provide any guarantee with respect to the obligations of,
any other person, other than advances to subsidiaries in the normal course
of business. Except as described in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries (x) directly or indirectly owns, (y) has
agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire or (z) holds any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any material amount of capital stock
(or equivalent equity interest) of any person (other than direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Parent). Except as set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no material agreements, arrangements
or commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which
any person is or may be entitled to receive any payment based on the revenues
or earnings, or calculated in accordance therewith, of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries. There are no material voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is bound with respect to
the voting of any shares of capital stock of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries.      Page 22  27   SECTION 4.04. Authority. Parent has
all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (subject to, with respect to the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock upon consummation of the Merger, the approval of this Agreement by the
Requisite Parent Stockholder Vote as described in Section 4.15). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent
in accordance with its terms.   SECTION 4.05. No Conflict; Required Filings

Parent does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not (i) conflict with or violate the charter or bylaws, in each case as
amended or restated, of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with
or violate any Laws applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or by
which any of their assets is bound or subject or (iii) result in any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or require payment
under, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by or to
which Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any of their assets is bound or
subject, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, amendments,
accelerations, cancellations, payments or Liens as would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, or (B) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule.   (b) No filing with or notification to, and no consent, license,

Governmental Entities the failure of which to make or receive would not have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.06. Permits; Compliance.
Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents,
certificates,       Page 23  28  approvals and orders necessary to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted (collectively, the "Parent Permits"), and there is no
Litigation pending or, to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened regarding
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits, other than the
failure to so possess, or such Litigation which would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is
in conflict with, or in default (nor has there occurred any event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or violation of (a)
any Law applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or by or to which any
of their assets is bound or subject or (b) any of the Parent Permits, except
for such conflicts, defaults or violations as would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.07. SEC Filings; Financial
Statements.   (a) Parent has filed with the SEC all forms,
reports, statements, and documents required to be filed by it pursuant to the

necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were or (in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date
of this Agreement) will be made, not misleading.   (c) Each of the
historical consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into Parent Reports as of its date, and each of the historical
consolidated statements of income and earnings, stockholders\' equity, and
cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into Parent Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents or will (in the
case of Parent Reports filed after the date of this Agreement) fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, stockholders\' equity, and cash flows, as the case may be, of
Parent and its subsidiaries for the periods set forth (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments), in each
case, in accordance with GAAP.   SECTION 4.08. Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Except as disclosed in Parent Reports filed prior to the date of

damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with
respect to any assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries that would have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b) any material change by Parent or any of
its subsidiaries in their accounting methods, principles or practices (except
as may be required by applicable Law or GAAP); (c) any declaration, setting
aside or payment of any dividends or       Page 24  29  distributions
in respect of shares of the capital stock of Parent or any of

subsidiaries of any of their securities (other than repurchases after the
Parent Balance Sheet Date pursuant to stock repurchase programs disclosed in
the Parent Reports); (d) any split, combination or reclassification of any

Parent Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value
of such Parent Employee Plan\'s "accumulated benefit obligation," based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions set forth in the actuarial statement for the
Parent Employee Plan, did not, as of its then latest valuation date, exceed
the fair value of the assets of such Parent Employee Plan allocable to such
obligation in an amount that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any other Parent ERISA Affiliate would
be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or

that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ix) there are no pending,
anticipated or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Parent
Employee Plans or any trusts related thereto or against any employee benefit
plan formerly maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries; (x) the Parent
Employee Plans could be terminated as of the Closing Date without any
liability to Company, the Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any other
ERISA Affiliate that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (xi) each agreement, contract or other commitment,
obligation or arrangement relating to a Parent Employee Plan or the assets of
a Parent Employee Plan (or its related trust) including, but not limited to,
each administrative services agreement, insurance        Page 26 
31  policy or annuity contract, may be amended or terminated at any time
without any liability, cost, or expense, individually or in the aggregate, to
the Parent Employee Plan, the Parent, or any of its subsidiaries that would

any of its subsidiaries, each patent, copyright and similar intellectual

Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent\'s stockholders.   SECTION 4.23. Rights Agreement Parent has made
available to the Company a true and complete copy of Parent\'s Rights
Agreement in effect on the date hereof. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will

the triggering of any other right or entitlement of Parent\'s stockholders
under such Rights Agreement.   SECTION 4.24. Commitment Letters As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has obtained and has provided to the Company a

duties under applicable law.   (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.04(a) but
subject to Section 5.04(e), the Company may engage in any discussions and
negotiations with, and provide information and data to, any person and such
person\'s representatives and financing sources in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such person, so long as:  
(1) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not have occurred and there shall
have been no breach of Section 5.04(a),   (2) the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely (including after further discussions and negotiations) to result in a
Superior Proposal (as defined below) or, after consultation with outside
counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that
it is required to take such action in order to discharge properly its
fiduciary duties under applicable law,   (3) prior to providing any such
information or data to any person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
by any such person, the Board of Directors of the Company receives from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that are
customary in such agreements, as advised by outside counsel, provided that if
such confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive
than the comparable provisions, or omits restrictive provisions, contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 9, 2001 between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), then the Confidentiality Agreement
will be deemed to be amended to contain only such less restrictive provisions
or to omit such restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and   (4) prior
to providing any such information or data or entering into such discussions
or negotiations, the Company notifies Parent promptly of the name of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that either is not subject to
a financing contingency, or if it is subject to a financing contingency,
is accompanied by executed financing commitments from bona fide lenders
in customary form and in a sufficient amount, and is on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company in good faith concludes (following receipt of
the advice of its financial advisors and outside counsel), taking into
account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, (i) will, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is likely to be completed.     
Page 38  43   (e) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause
its officers, directors, financial advisors, and representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees that it will promptly inform its directors, officers, key employees,
agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section
5.04.   (f) Prior to the time that this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, the Company will not sign any agreement, letter
of intent or other similar instrument accepting an Acquisition Proposal by
any person other than Parent. Nothing in this Section 5.04 shall permit the
Company to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in
Article VIII hereof) or affect any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement. The Company will not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company or its Board of Directors will be
permitted to, to the extent applicable, comply with Item 1012 of Regulation
M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal.   SECTION 5.05. Access and Information.   (a) The Company will,
and will cause its subsidiaries to (i) afford to Parent and its officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and
other representatives (collectively, the "Parent Representatives") reasonable
access at reasonable times throughout the period prior to the Effective Time,
upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, assets,
offices and other facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries and to the
books and records thereof, (ii) furnish promptly to Parent and the Parent
Representatives such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel of the Company and its subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, financial, operating and other data and
information) as may be reasonably requested, from time to time throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, by Parent, and (iii) afford to
any potential viable purchasers of any assets (including lines of business)
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries as
contemplated under Section 5.06(d) and to their officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives reasonable access at reasonable times throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers,
employees, agents, assets, offices and other facilities of the Company and
its subsidiaries and the books and records in each case relating to such
assets.   (b) Parent will, and will cause its subsidiaries to (i) afford to
the Company and its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives (collectively,
the "Company Representatives") reasonable access at reasonable times
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable prior
notice, to the officers, employees, accountants, agents, properties, offices
and other facilities of Parent and its subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof and (ii) furnish promptly to the Company and the Company
Representatives such information concerning the business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel of Parent and its subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, financial,      Page 39  44  operating and other
data and information) as may be reasonably requested, from time to time
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, by the Company.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.05, neither party
will be required to grant access or furnish information to the other party to
the extent that such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by Law or would waive any rights to privileged communications. No
investigation by the parties hereto made heretofore or hereafter shall affect
the representations and warranties of the parties that are herein contained,
and each such representation and warranty will survive such
investigation.   (d) The information received pursuant to subsections (a)
and (b) above will be deemed to be "Confidential Information" for purposes of
the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 5.06. Appropriate Action;
Consents; Filings.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent will: (i) promptly after the date of this
Agreement make their respective filings under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger and thereafter shall promptly make any other required submissions
under the HSR Act; (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
one another in (A) determining which filings and notifications are required
to be made prior to the Effective Time under applicable Law with, and which
consents, licenses, approvals, permits, waivers, orders or authorizations are
required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time under applicable Law
from, Governmental Entities of the United States and the several states in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby; (B)
timely making all such filings and notifications and timely seeking all such
consents, licenses, approvals, permits, waivers, orders or authorizations;
and (C) as promptly as practicable, responding to any request for information
from such Governmental Entities; (iii) subject to any restrictions under
antitrust Laws, to the extent practicable, promptly notify each other of any
communication to that party from any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and permit the other party
to review in advance any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity; (iv) not agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat, in each case to the extent practicable; (v) subject to
any restrictions under antitrust Laws, furnish the other party with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications
which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements and to the
attorney client privilege or work product doctrine); and (vi) furnish
the other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registration, or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entities in connection        Page
40  45  with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation any filings necessary or appropriate under the
provisions of the HSR Act.   (b) Without limiting Section 5.06(a) and
subject in all respects to Sections 5.06(c) and 5.06(d), Parent and the
Company will: (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or terminated, any order,
judgment, injunction or decree (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
or any other judicial, administrative or legislative action or proceeding
("Order") that would restrain, prevent or delay the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on or before December 31, 2001,
including, without limitation, defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any party; and (ii) each use its reasonable
best efforts to take any steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than December 31, 2001).   (c) Without limiting Section 5.06(a) and
subject in all respects to Section 5.06(d), Parent, on behalf of Parent and
the Company, shall agree to divest, hold separate, or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent and/or the Company or any of its subsidiaries, provided that any such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company agrees
and acknowledges that, in connection with any filing or submission required,
action to be taken or commitment to be made by Parent, the Company or any of
its respective subsidiaries to consummate the Merger or other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall, without Parent\'s prior written consent, divest any
assets, commit to any divestiture of assets or businesses of the Company and
its subsidiaries or take any other action or commit to take any action that
would limit the Company\'s, Parent\'s or any of their respective
subsidiaries\' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain,
any of their businesses, product lines or assets.   (d) Notwithstanding the
foregoing paragraphs of this Section 5.06, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Parent to agree to the sale, transfer, divestiture or other
disposition of any assets (including any lines of business) of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or any of the other actions
contemplated in Section 5.06(c) if Parent concludes that the taking of such
action or the making of any commitments or the consequences thereof would be
reasonably likely to have a Combined Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent hereby agrees that it
will agree to divest the processing plants set forth on Exhibit 5.06(d) to
this Agreement, and such other assets as are reasonably necessary to
operate such plants, in connection with its seeking, and will so divest such
plants if necessary in order to obtain, any necessary consent, license,
approval, permit, waiver, order or authorization under applicable antitrust
laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and that such
divestitures, individually or in the aggregate, shall not constitute a
Combined Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement
"Combined Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect that,
individually or when taken together with all other such changes or effects,
would be materially adverse to the business,       Page 41 
46  operations, assets, financial condition, or results of operations of the
Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Company and its subsidiaries)
after the Effective Time, taken as a whole.   (e) Each of Parent and the
Company shall give (or shall cause their respective subsidiaries to give, as
applicable) any notices to third parties, and use (and cause their respective
subsidiaries to use, as applicable) all reasonable best efforts to obtain any
other third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) otherwise required
under any Company Material Contracts, Company Permits or other agreements in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
(iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect from occurring. In the event that any party fails to
obtain any third party consent described above and the parties agree to
consummate the Merger without such consent, such party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and will take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other parties, to limit the adverse effect upon
the Company and Parent, their respective subsidiaries and their respective
businesses resulting or which could reasonably be expected to result after
the Effective Time from the failure to obtain such consent.   (f) Each of
Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other of (i) any material
change in the current or future business, financial condition or results of
operations of it or any of its material subsidiaries, (ii) any complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be
contemplated) of any Governmental Entities with respect to the business of it
or any of its subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby, which, if
adversely determined, would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, (iii) the
institution or the threat of material litigation involving it or any of its
subsidiaries or (iv) any event or condition that might reasonably be expected
to cause any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth herein not to be true and correct at the Effective Time.   SECTION
5.07. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the Merger and will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law or the rules of the NYSE. The
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement will be
a joint press release of Parent and the Company.   SECTION 5.08. NYSE
Listing. Parent will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing (subject to official notice of issuance) on the NYSE prior to the
Effective Time.   SECTION 5.09. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) For at least
the first twelve months after the Closing Date, Parent will cause the current
and former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are, on the
Closing Date, entitled to receive compensation or any benefits from the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to be provided with compensation and
employee benefit plans (other than stock option or other plans involving the
potential issuance of securities of the Company) which, in the       
Page 42  47  aggregate, are substantially comparable to those currently
provided to such employees by the Company and its subsidiaries, to the extent
permitted under laws and regulations in force from time to time; provided
that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements need not be
provided with such benefits other than pursuant to such collective bargaining
agreements. The provisions of this Section 5.09(a) will not create in any
current or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries any
rights to employment or continued employment with Parent, the Company or any
of their respective subsidiaries, or any right to specific terms or
conditions of employment.   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and subject to the provisions of Section 5.09(a), from and
after the Closing Date, Parent will have sole discretion over the hiring,
promotion, retention, termination and other terms and conditions of the
employment of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subject to
the provisions of Section 5.09(a), nothing herein will prevent Parent, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries from amending or terminating
any Employee Plan maintained by the Company or its subsidiaries or other
employee benefit or fringe benefit plan of Parent in accordance with its
terms.   (c) The Parent will grant all employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date credit for all service with
the Company and its subsidiaries and any of their respective predecessors
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any
employee benefit plan of the Parent in which the employees may become
participants.   (d) As of the Closing Date, Parent will assume, honor
and perform, or will cause the Company and its subsidiaries to assume, honor
and perform, the benefits accrued as of the Closing Date under all
deferred compensation, incentive compensation or vacation and other paid time
off plans, policies or arrangements maintained or contributed to by the
Company and its subsidiaries and any employment, consulting, retention,
severance or similar agreement to which the Company is a party with any
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in accordance with the
terms thereof in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the
requirements of Section 5.09(a) and except as otherwise provided in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent may revise and modify such plans,
policies or arrangements for benefits accruing after the Closing Date.  
(e) The Parent will provide or cause to be provided, effective commencing
immediately after the Closing Date, coverage to all employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and their spouses
and dependents, under a group health plan which does not contain any
exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing conditions and
provides full credit for all deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred under any group health plan covering such employees or
qualified dependents prior to the Closing Date and within the same plan year
of such employee benefit plan, and Parent shall be solely responsible for
compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of
the subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), including, without limitation,
the provision of continuation coverage, with respect to all employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries and their spouses and dependents, for whom a
qualifying event occurs before or after the Closing       Page 43 
48  Date. The terms "group health plan," "continuation coverage,"
"qualifying event," and "qualified beneficiary" are used herein with the
meanings ascribed to them in COBRA.   SECTION 5.10. Name of Parent. Parent
will, as of the Effective Time, change its name to Dean Foods Company.  
SECTION 5.11. Board of Directors of Parent. Parent will, as of the Effective
Time, increase the size of its Board of Directors by five seats and cause the
election of the individuals agreed upon by Parent and the Company to its
Board of Directors to fill the vacancies created by such increase in
size, one of which individuals will be elected for a term expiring at the
first annual meeting after the Closing Date, two of which individuals will be
elected for a term expiring at the second annual meeting after the Closing
Date, and two of which individuals will be elected for a term expiring at the
third annual meeting after the Closing Date. The Board of Directors of Parent
shall elect Howard Dean as Chairman of the Board of Parent and a member of
Parent\'s Management Committee until the earlier of his resignation from the
Board of Directors or he reaches age 65.   SECTION 5.12. Tax Treatment.
Each party hereto will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and will not take, and will use all reasonable efforts to prevent
any affiliate of such party from taking, any actions which could prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of Sections
368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code. Each party hereto will file all
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with treating the Merger as a
reorganization under such provisions of the Code.   SECTION 5.13. Reasonable
Best Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and
to applicable Laws, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in
doing, as promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to ensure that the conditions set forth
in Article VII are satisfied and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Without limiting the
generality of the provisions in Section 5.13(a) above, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to close the financing contemplated by the commitment
letters delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 4.24 and to use the
funds from such financing to consummate the Merger, including the execution
of the loan documents contemplated by such financing commitments on or before
July 31, 2001.   (c) If at any time after the Effective Time any
reasonable further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, including the execution of additional instruments, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all
such necessary reasonable action.      Page 44  49   ARTICLE VI  
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 6.01. Meetings of Stockholders.   (a) The
Company will duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable (the
"Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Stockholder Vote and will its use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit the adoption of the Agreement by the Requisite Company Stockholder
Vote; and the Board of Directors of the Company will recommend adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the
"Company Recommendation"), and will not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent such
recommendation or (y) take any action or make any statement (other than any
action described in the foregoing clause (x)) in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a
"Change in the Company Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation
pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company
Recommendation, this Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement and nothing contained herein will be deemed to relieve the Company
of such obligation.   (b) Parent will duly take all lawful action to call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as soon as
reasonably practicable (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite
Parent Stockholder Vote, and the Board of Directors of Parent will recommend
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement by
the stockholders of Parent (the "Parent Recommendation"), and will not,
unless the Company makes a Change in the Company Recommendation, (x)
withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in
any manner adverse to the Company\'s stockholders such recommendation or (y)
take any action or make any statement (other than any action described in the
foregoing clause (x)) in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Parent
Recommendation").   SECTION 6.02. Preparation of Proxy Statement. As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company and
Parent will cooperate in preparing and each will cause to be filed with the
SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials that constitute the joint proxy
statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
matters to be submitted to the stockholders of Parent at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Parent will
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with
respect to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4,
and any amendments or supplements       Page 45  50  thereto, the
"Form S-4"). The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a
prospectus in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4 as
Parent\'s prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and
the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective
as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Parent and the Company will, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any
written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the
SEC. The parties will cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the
SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the
approval of both parties, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval will apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations. Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parent
stockholders, and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company\'s
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent will also take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
Merger and each of the Company and Parent will furnish all information
concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each party will advise the
other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or
the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
should be discovered by Parent or the Company, which information should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent and the Company.      Page 46  51   SECTION
6.03. Indemnification.   (a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor
of directors, officers or employees of the Company as provided in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, as in effect on the
date hereof, with respect to matters occurring through the Effective Time,
will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect
thereafter.   (b) Parent will cause to be maintained in effect for six
years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions which are not materially less advantageous)
with respect to matters or events occurring prior to the Effective Time to
the extent available; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend more than an amount per year in excess of 200% of the per
annum premiums for such insurance paid by the Company as of the date hereof
to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; and, provided,
further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.   (c) Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, will be construed to or will release, waive or
impair any rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.03 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.   ARTICLE VII

its written opinion dated the Closing Date substantially to the effect that
(i) the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a)(1)(A) and section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code,       Page

Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (if not subject
to a materiality qualifier) or in all respects (if subject to a materiality

Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically
relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct in all material respects (if not subject to a
materiality qualifier) or in all respects (if subject to a
materiality qualifier) as of such earlier date); except where the failure of
such representation and warranty (other than the representation and
warranty contained in Section 4.03) to be so true and correct would not
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received a
certificate of a senior executive officer and a senior financial officer of
the Parent, dated the Closing Date, to such effect.   (b) Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects with all

shall not have been consummated before December 31, 2001; provided, however,

this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Merger to occur as of such date;   (f) by Parent or the Company (provided
that the terminating party is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement), if the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval or the Requisite Parent Stockholder
Approval, respectively, shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure
to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of stockholders or of any
adjournment thereof at which the vote was taken;   (g) by Parent, if the
Company shall have (i) failed to make the Company Recommendation or effected
a Change in the Company Recommendation (or resolved to take any such action),
whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (ii) materially breached its
obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to call the Company

agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;   (h) by the Company, if
Parent shall have (i) failed to make the Parent Recommendation or effected a

accordance with Section 6.02; or   (i) by the Company if the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined to accept a Superior Proposal.  
SECTION 8.02. Effect of Termination.   (a) Subject to Section 8.02(b), in
the event of any permitted termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any
of the parties or their respective officers or directors except with respect
to Section 3.17, Section 4.16, Section 5.05(d), this Section 8.02, Section
8.03 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such termination, and
except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of this
Agreement.   (b) In the event that:   (i) Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g),   (ii) the Company shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(i), or   (iii) (A) Parent or the
Company shall have terminated this Agreement for any reason other than
pursuant to Section 8.01(c), Section 8.01(d) or Section 8.01(h), (B) the
Company shall have received an Acquisition Proposal prior to such
termination, and (C) within 180 days of such termination, the Company shall
have executed or entered into a letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or
similar agreement or proposed publicly or agreed to do any of the foregoing
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (D) such letter,
agreement or proposal contemplates a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving the disposition of 50% or more of the
consolidated assets (including without limitation stock of its subsidiaries)
of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,  then the Company
shall promptly, but in no event later than the date of such termination (or,
if later, with respect to a termination under Section 8.02(b)(iii) above, the
date the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into any such letter,
agreement or proposal or consummates any such      Page 51 
56  transaction), pay Parent $45 million (the "Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. If this Agreement is terminated as
contemplated in this Section 8.02(b), such termination will not be effective
until payment of the fee required by this Section 8.02(b).   (c) The
parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.02 and in
Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties would
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.02 or the Company or Parent fails
promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.03, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the party that has not been so paid commences a suit
which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this
Section 8.02 or the Expenses set forth in Section 8.03, the non-paying party
will pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. The parties agree
that any remedy or amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.02 will not
preclude any other remedy or amount payable hereunder and will not be an
exclusive remedy for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement.   SECTION 8.03. Fees and Expenses.
Without limiting Section 8.02, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Expenses (as defined below) will be paid by the party incurring such
Expenses, except (a) if the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation
will pay, or cause to be paid, any and all transfer taxes imposed in
connection with the Merger, (b) Expenses incurred in connection with the
filing, printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form
S-4 and (c) expenses relating to independent third party analyses of cost
savings and operational synergies, which will be shared equally by Parent and
the Company; provided, that if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(f) (provided that the basis for such termination is the
failure of the Company\'s stockholders to adopt this Agreement), the Company
will reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their affiliates (not later than one
business day after submission of statements together with reasonable
documentation therefor) for one-half of their Expenses, but in no event more
than $10 million, and if this Agreement is terminated as permitted herein and
the Termination Fee is payable under Section 8.02(b) all of their Expenses,
but in no event more than $15 million; provided, further, that if the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) (provided that the
basis for such termination is the failure of Parent\'s stockholders to adopt
this Agreement), Parent will reimburse the Company and its affiliates (not
later than one business day after submission of statements together with
reasonable documentation therefor) for one-half of their Expenses, but in no
event more than $10 million. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, financing commitment
fees and all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the preparation,

or interpretation of this Agreement. Section references herein are, unless
the context otherwise requires, references to sections of this Agreement.  
SECTION 9.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the

Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any
party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its
failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation
of the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties for which
damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each
party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party\'s obligations and
to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder.   SECTION 9.10. Amendment. This Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their

amendment, which under applicable Law or relevant stock exchange rules may
not be made without the approval of such stockholders, may be made without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   SECTION 9.11. Waiver;

of this Section 9.11, the Parent and Merger Sub as a group shall be deemed to
be one party. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty
or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.      Page 56  61   SECTION 9.12. Governing Law. This
